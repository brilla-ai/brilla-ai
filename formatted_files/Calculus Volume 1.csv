Functions,"_paragraph_1
 Given two sets AA and B,B, a set with elements that are ordered pairs (x,y),(x,y), where xx is an element of AA and yy is an element of B,B, is a relation from AA to B.B. A relation from AA to BB defines a relationship between those two sets. A function is a special type of relation in which each element of the first set is related to exactly one element of the second set. The element of the first set is called the input; the element of the second set is called the output. Functions are used all the time in mathematics to describe relationships between two sets. For any function, when we know the input, the output is determined, so we say that the output is a function of the input. For example, the area of a square is determined by its side length, so we say that the area (the output) is a function of its side length (the input). The velocity of a ball thrown in the air can be described as a function of the amount of time the ball is in the air. The cost of mailing a package is a function of the weight of the package. Since functions have so many uses, it is important to have precise definitions and terminology to study them.

 Definition
_paragraph_16
 A function ff consists of a set of inputs, a set of outputs, and a rule for assigning each input to exactly one output. The set of inputs is called the domain of the function. The set of outputs is called the range of the function.

 For example, consider the function f,f, where the domain is the set of all real numbers and the rule is to square the input. Then, the input x=3x=3 is assigned to the output 32=9.32=9. Since every nonnegative real number has a real-value square root, every nonnegative number is an element of the range of this function. Since there is no real number with a square that is negative, the negative real numbers are not elements of the range. We conclude that the range is the set of nonnegative real numbers.

_paragraph_25
 For a general function ff with domain D,D, we often use xx to denote the input and yy to denote the output associated with x.x. When doing so, we refer to xx as the independent variable and yy as the dependent variable, because it depends on x.x. Using function notation, we write y=f(x),y=f(x), and we read this equation as “y“y equals ff of x.”x.” For the squaring function described earlier, we write f(x)=x2.f(x)=x2.

 In this case, a graph of a function ff has a domain of {1,2,3}{1,2,3} and a range of {1,2}.{1,2}. The independent variable is xx and the dependent variable is y.y.

_paragraph_53
 We can also visualize a function by plotting points (x,y)(x,y) in the coordinate plane where y=f(x).y=f(x). The graph of a function is the set of all these points. For example, consider the function f,f, where the domain is the set D={1,2,3}D={1,2,3} and the rule is f(x)=3−x.f(x)=3−x. In Figure 1.5, we plot a graph of this function.

 Here we see a graph of the function ff with domain {1,2,3}{1,2,3} and rule f(x)=3−x.f(x)=3−x. The graph consists of the points (x,f(x))(x,f(x)) for all xx in the domain.
_paragraph_63
 Every function has a domain. However, sometimes a function is described by an equation, as in f(x)=x2,f(x)=x2, with no specific domain given. In this case, the domain is taken to be the set of all real numbers xx for which f(x)f(x) is a real number. For example, since any real number can be squared, if no other domain is specified, we consider the domain of f(x)=x2f(x)=x2 to be the set of all real numbers. On the other hand, the square root function f(x)=xf(x)=x only gives a real output if xx is nonnegative. Therefore, the domain of the function f(x)=xf(x)=x is the set of nonnegative real numbers, sometimes called the natural domain.

_paragraph_71
 For the functions f(x)=x2f(x)=x2 and f(x)=x,f(x)=x, the domains are sets with an infinite number of elements. Clearly we cannot list all these elements. When describing a set with an infinite number of elements, it is often helpful to use set-builder or interval notation. When using set-builder notation to describe a subset of all real numbers, denoted ℝ,ℝ, we write
_paragraph_72
 f(x)=x2f(x)=x2
_paragraph_73
 f(x)=x,f(x)=x,
_paragraph_74
 ℝ,ℝ,
_paragraph_75
 We read this as the set of real numbers xx such that xx has some property. For example, if we were interested in the set of real numbers that are greater than one but less than five, we could denote this set using set-builder notation by writing
_paragraph_76
 xx
_paragraph_77

_paragraph_78
 A set such as this, which contains all numbers greater than aa and less than b,b, can also be denoted using the interval notation (a,b).(a,b). Therefore,

_paragraph_83
 The numbers 11 and 55 are called the endpoints of this set. If we want to consider the set that includes the endpoints, we would denote this set by writing
_paragraph_84
 11
_paragraph_85
 55
_paragraph_86
 endpoints
_paragraph_87
 We can use similar notation if we want to include one of the endpoints, but not the other. To denote the set of nonnegative real numbers, we would use the set-builder notation
_paragraph_88
 The smallest number in this set is zero, but this set does not have a largest number. Using interval notation, we would use the symbol ∞,∞, which refers to positive infinity, and we would write the set as
_paragraph_89
 ∞,∞,
_paragraph_90
 It is important to note that ∞∞ is not a real number. It is used symbolically here to indicate that this set includes all real numbers greater than or equal to zero. Similarly, if we wanted to describe the set of all nonpositive numbers, we could write
_paragraph_91
 ∞∞
_paragraph_92
 Here, the notation −∞−∞ refers to negative infinity, and it indicates that we are including all numbers less than or equal to zero, no matter how small. The set
_paragraph_93
 −∞−∞
_paragraph_94
 refers to the set of all real numbers.
_paragraph_95
 Some functions are defined using different equations for different parts of their domain. These types of functions are known as piecewise-defined functions. For example, suppose we want to define a function ff with a domain that is the set of all real numbers such that f(x)=3x+1f(x)=3x+1 for x≥2x≥2 and f(x)=x2f(x)=x2 for x<2.x<2. We denote this function by writing

_paragraph_101
 x<2.x<2.
_paragraph_102
 When evaluating this function for an input x,x, the equation to use depends on whether x≥2x≥2 or x<2.x<2. For example, since 5>2,5>2, we use the fact that f(x)=3x+1f(x)=3x+1 for x≥2x≥2 and see that f(5)=3(5)+1=16.f(5)=3(5)+1=16. On the other hand, for x=−1,x=−1, we use the fact that f(x)=x2f(x)=x2 for x<2x<2 and see that f(−1)=1.f(−1)=1.

Representing Functions,"_paragraph_1
 Typically, a function is represented using one or more of the following tools:
_paragraph_2
 We can identify a function in each form, but we can also use them together. For instance, we can plot on a graph the values from a table or create a table from a formula.
_paragraph_3
 Functions described using a table of values arise frequently in real-world applications. Consider the following simple example. We can describe temperature on a given day as a function of time of day. Suppose we record the temperature every hour for a 24-hour period starting at midnight. We let our input variable xx be the time after midnight, measured in hours, and the output variable yy be the temperature xx hours after midnight, measured in degrees Fahrenheit. We record our data in Table 1.1.

 Temperature as a Function of Time of Day
_paragraph_11
 We can see from the table that temperature is a function of time, and the temperature decreases, then increases, and then decreases again. However, we cannot get a clear picture of the behavior of the function without graphing it.
_paragraph_12
 Given a function ff described by a table, we can provide a visual picture of the function in the form of a graph. Graphing the temperatures listed in Table 1.1 can give us a better idea of their fluctuation throughout the day. Figure 1.6 shows the plot of the temperature function.

_paragraph_15

_paragraph_16
 The graph of the data from Table 1.1 shows temperature as a function of time.
_paragraph_17
 From the points plotted on the graph in Figure 1.6, we can visualize the general shape of the graph. It is often useful to connect the dots in the graph, which represent the data from the table. In this example, although we cannot make any definitive conclusion regarding what the temperature was at any time for which the temperature was not recorded, given the number of data points collected and the pattern in these points, it is reasonable to suspect that the temperatures at other times followed a similar pattern, as we can see in Figure 1.7.

_paragraph_20
 Connecting the dots in Figure 1.6 shows the general pattern of the data.
_paragraph_21
 Sometimes we are not given the values of a function in table form, rather we are given the values in an explicit formula. Formulas arise in many applications. For example, the area of a circle of radius rr is given by the formula A(r)=πr2.A(r)=πr2. When an object is thrown upward from the ground with an initial velocity v0v0 ft/s, its height above the ground from the time it is thrown until it hits the ground is given by the formula s(t)=−16t2+v0t.s(t)=−16t2+v0t. When PP dollars are invested in an account at an annual interest rate rr compounded continuously, the amount of money after tt years is given by the formula A(t)=Pert.A(t)=Pert. Algebraic formulas are important tools to calculate function values. Often we also represent these functions visually in graph form.

_paragraph_30
 Given an algebraic formula for a function f,f, the graph of ff is the set of points (x,f(x)),(x,f(x)), where xx is in the domain of ff and f(x)f(x) is in the range. To graph a function given by a formula, it is helpful to begin by using the formula to create a table of inputs and outputs. If the domain of ff consists of an infinite number of values, we cannot list all of them, but because listing some of the inputs and outputs can be very useful, it is often a good way to begin.

_paragraph_38
 When creating a table of inputs and outputs, we typically check to determine whether zero is an output. Those values of xx where f(x)=0f(x)=0 are called the zeros of a function. For example, the zeros of f(x)=x2−4f(x)=x2−4 are x=±2.x=±2. The zeros determine where the graph of ff intersects the xx-axis, which gives us more information about the shape of the graph of the function. The graph of a function may never intersect the x-axis, or it may intersect multiple (or even infinitely many) times.

 (0,f(0)).(0,f(0)).
_paragraph_50
 Since a function has exactly one output for each input, the graph of a function can have, at most, one yy-intercept. If x=0x=0 is in the domain of a function f,f, then ff has exactly one yy-intercept. If x=0x=0 is not in the domain of f,f, then ff has no yy-intercept. Similarly, for any real number c,c, if cc is in the domain of f,f, there is exactly one output f(c),f(c), and the line x=cx=c intersects the graph of ff exactly once. On the other hand, if cc is not in the domain of f,f(c)f,f(c) is not defined and the line x=cx=c does not intersect the graph of f.f. This property is summarized in the vertical line test.

 Rule: Vertical Line Test
_paragraph_72
 Given a function f,f, every vertical line that may be drawn intersects the graph of ff no more than once. If any vertical line intersects a set of points more than once, the set of points does not represent a function.

 Note that for this function and the function f(x)=−4x+2f(x)=−4x+2 graphed in Figure 1.9, the values of f(x)f(x) are getting smaller as xx is getting larger. A function with this property is said to be decreasing. On the other hand, for the function f(x)=x+3+1f(x)=x+3+1 graphed in Figure 1.10, the values of f(x)f(x) are getting larger as the values of xx are getting larger. A function with this property is said to be increasing. It is important to note, however, that a function can be increasing on some interval or intervals and decreasing over a different interval or intervals. For example, using our temperature function in Figure 1.6, we can see that the function is decreasing on the interval (0,4),(0,4), increasing on the interval (4,14),(4,14), and then decreasing on the interval (14,23).(14,23). We make the idea of a function increasing or decreasing over a particular interval more precise in the next definition.

Tables,"_paragraph_1
 Functions described using a table of values arise frequently in real-world applications. Consider the following simple example. We can describe temperature on a given day as a function of time of day. Suppose we record the temperature every hour for a 24-hour period starting at midnight. We let our input variable xx be the time after midnight, measured in hours, and the output variable yy be the temperature xx hours after midnight, measured in degrees Fahrenheit. We record our data in Table 1.1.

Graphs,"_paragraph_1
 Given a function ff described by a table, we can provide a visual picture of the function in the form of a graph. Graphing the temperatures listed in Table 1.1 can give us a better idea of their fluctuation throughout the day. Figure 1.6 shows the plot of the temperature function.

 The graph of the data from Table 1.1 shows temperature as a function of time.
_paragraph_6
 From the points plotted on the graph in Figure 1.6, we can visualize the general shape of the graph. It is often useful to connect the dots in the graph, which represent the data from the table. In this example, although we cannot make any definitive conclusion regarding what the temperature was at any time for which the temperature was not recorded, given the number of data points collected and the pattern in these points, it is reasonable to suspect that the temperatures at other times followed a similar pattern, as we can see in Figure 1.7.

Algebraic Formulas,"_paragraph_1
 Sometimes we are not given the values of a function in table form, rather we are given the values in an explicit formula. Formulas arise in many applications. For example, the area of a circle of radius rr is given by the formula A(r)=πr2.A(r)=πr2. When an object is thrown upward from the ground with an initial velocity v0v0 ft/s, its height above the ground from the time it is thrown until it hits the ground is given by the formula s(t)=−16t2+v0t.s(t)=−16t2+v0t. When PP dollars are invested in an account at an annual interest rate rr compounded continuously, the amount of money after tt years is given by the formula A(t)=Pert.A(t)=Pert. Algebraic formulas are important tools to calculate function values. Often we also represent these functions visually in graph form.

_paragraph_10
 Given an algebraic formula for a function f,f, the graph of ff is the set of points (x,f(x)),(x,f(x)), where xx is in the domain of ff and f(x)f(x) is in the range. To graph a function given by a formula, it is helpful to begin by using the formula to create a table of inputs and outputs. If the domain of ff consists of an infinite number of values, we cannot list all of them, but because listing some of the inputs and outputs can be very useful, it is often a good way to begin.

 When creating a table of inputs and outputs, we typically check to determine whether zero is an output. Those values of xx where f(x)=0f(x)=0 are called the zeros of a function. For example, the zeros of f(x)=x2−4f(x)=x2−4 are x=±2.x=±2. The zeros determine where the graph of ff intersects the xx-axis, which gives us more information about the shape of the graph of the function. The graph of a function may never intersect the x-axis, or it may intersect multiple (or even infinitely many) times.

 Since a function has exactly one output for each input, the graph of a function can have, at most, one yy-intercept. If x=0x=0 is in the domain of a function f,f, then ff has exactly one yy-intercept. If x=0x=0 is not in the domain of f,f, then ff has no yy-intercept. Similarly, for any real number c,c, if cc is in the domain of f,f, there is exactly one output f(c),f(c), and the line x=cx=c intersects the graph of ff exactly once. On the other hand, if cc is not in the domain of f,f(c)f,f(c) is not defined and the line x=cx=c does not intersect the graph of f.f. This property is summarized in the vertical line test.

 Note that for this function and the function f(x)=−4x+2f(x)=−4x+2 graphed in Figure 1.9, the values of f(x)f(x) are getting smaller as xx is getting larger. A function with this property is said to be decreasing. On the other hand, for the function f(x)=x+3+1f(x)=x+3+1 graphed in Figure 1.10, the values of f(x)f(x) are getting larger as the values of xx are getting larger. A function with this property is said to be increasing. It is important to note, however, that a function can be increasing on some interval or intervals and decreasing over a different interval or intervals. For example, using our temperature function in Figure 1.6, we can see that the function is decreasing on the interval (0,4),(0,4), increasing on the interval (4,14),(4,14), and then decreasing on the interval (14,23).(14,23). We make the idea of a function increasing or decreasing over a particular interval more precise in the next definition.

Combining Functions,"_paragraph_1
 Now that we have reviewed the basic characteristics of functions, we can see what happens to these properties when we combine functions in different ways, using basic mathematical operations to create new functions. For example, if the cost for a company to manufacture xx items is described by the function C(x)C(x) and the revenue created by the sale of xx items is described by the function R(x),R(x), then the profit on the manufacture and sale of xx items is defined as P(x)=R(x)−C(x).P(x)=R(x)−C(x). Using the difference between two functions, we created a new function.

_paragraph_8
 Alternatively, we can create a new function by composing two functions. For example, given the functions f(x)=x2f(x)=x2 and g(x)=3x+1,g(x)=3x+1, the composite function f∘gf∘g is defined such that
_paragraph_9
 f(x)=x2f(x)=x2
_paragraph_10
 g(x)=3x+1,g(x)=3x+1,
_paragraph_11
 f∘gf∘g
_paragraph_12
 The composite function g∘fg∘f is defined such that
_paragraph_13
 g∘fg∘f
_paragraph_14
 Note that these two new functions are different from each other.
_paragraph_15
 To combine functions using mathematical operators, we simply write the functions with the operator and simplify. Given two functions ff and g,g, we can define four new functions:

 When we compose functions, we take a function of a function. For example, suppose the temperature TT on a given day is described as a function of time tt (measured in hours after midnight) as in Table 1.1. Suppose the cost C,C, to heat or cool a building for 1 hour, can be described as a function of the temperature T.T. Combining these two functions, we can describe the cost of heating or cooling a building as a function of time by evaluating C(T(t)).C(T(t)). We have defined a new function, denoted C∘T,C∘T, which is defined such that (C∘T)(t)=C(T(t))(C∘T)(t)=C(T(t)) for all tt in the domain of T.T. This new function is called a composite function. We note that since cost is a function of temperature and temperature is a function of time, it makes sense to define this new function (C∘T)(t).(C∘T)(t). It does not make sense to consider (T∘C)(t),(T∘C)(t), because temperature is not a function of cost.

 A composite function g∘fg∘f can be viewed in two steps. First, the function ff maps each input xx in the domain of ff to its output f(x)f(x) in the range of f.f. Second, since the range of ff is a subset of the domain of g,g, the output f(x)f(x) is an element in the domain of g,g, and therefore it is mapped to an output g(f(x))g(f(x)) in the range of g.g.

Therefore, if the price is originally xx dollars, its sale price will be f(x)=0.80xf(x)=0.80x and then its final price after the coupon will be g(f(x))=0.85(0.80x)=0.68x.g(f(x))=0.85(0.80x)=0.68x.

Function Composition,"_paragraph_1
 When we compose functions, we take a function of a function. For example, suppose the temperature TT on a given day is described as a function of time tt (measured in hours after midnight) as in Table 1.1. Suppose the cost C,C, to heat or cool a building for 1 hour, can be described as a function of the temperature T.T. Combining these two functions, we can describe the cost of heating or cooling a building as a function of time by evaluating C(T(t)).C(T(t)). We have defined a new function, denoted C∘T,C∘T, which is defined such that (C∘T)(t)=C(T(t))(C∘T)(t)=C(T(t)) for all tt in the domain of T.T. This new function is called a composite function. We note that since cost is a function of temperature and temperature is a function of time, it makes sense to define this new function (C∘T)(t).(C∘T)(t). It does not make sense to consider (T∘C)(t),(T∘C)(t), because temperature is not a function of cost.

Symmetry of Functions,"_paragraph_1
 The graphs of certain functions have symmetry properties that help us understand the function and the shape of its graph. For example, consider the function f(x)=x4−2x2−3f(x)=x4−2x2−3 shown in Figure 1.13(a). If we take the part of the curve that lies to the right of the y-axis and flip it over the y-axis, it lays exactly on top of the curve to the left of the y-axis. In this case, we say the function has symmetry about the y-axis. On the other hand, consider the function f(x)=x3−4xf(x)=x3−4x shown in Figure 1.13(b). If we take the graph and rotate it 180°180° about the origin, the new graph will look exactly the same. In this case, we say the function has symmetry about the origin.

_paragraph_10
 If we are given the graph of a function, it is easy to see whether the graph has one of these symmetry properties. But without a graph, how can we determine algebraically whether a function ff has symmetry? Looking at Figure 1.13 again, we see that since ff is symmetric about the yy-axis, if the point (x,y)(x,y) is on the graph, the point (−x,y)(−x,y) is on the graph. In other words, f(−x)=f(x).f(−x)=f(x). If a function ff has this property, we say ff is an even function, which has symmetry about the y-axis. For example, f(x)=x2f(x)=x2 is even because

 In contrast, looking at Figure 1.13 again, if a function ff is symmetric about the origin, then whenever the point (x,y)(x,y) is on the graph, the point (−x,−y)(−x,−y) is also on the graph. In other words, f(−x)=−f(x).f(−x)=−f(x). If ff has this property, we say ff is an odd function, which has symmetry about the origin. For example, f(x)=x3f(x)=x3 is odd because

 |x|.|x|.

 Some students describe this function by stating that it “makes everything positive.” By the definition of the absolute value function, we see that if x<0,x<0, then |x|=−x>0,|x|=−x>0, and if x>0,x>0, then |x|=x>0.|x|=x>0. However, for x=0,|x|=0.x=0,|x|=0. Therefore, it is more accurate to say that for all nonzero inputs, the output is positive, but if x=0,x=0, the output |x|=0.|x|=0. We conclude that the range of the absolute value function is {y|y≥0}.{y|y≥0}. In Figure 1.14, we see that the absolute value function is symmetric about the y-axis and is therefore an even function.

_paragraph_73
 Since the absolute value function is defined for all real numbers, the domain of this function is (−∞,∞).(−∞,∞). Since |x−3|≥0|x−3|≥0 for all x,x, the function f(x)=2|x−3|+4≥4.f(x)=2|x−3|+4≥4. Therefore, the range is, at most, the set {y|y≥4}.{y|y≥4}. To see that the range is, in fact, this whole set, we need to show that for y≥4y≥4 there exists a real number xx such that

 [T] The volume V of a sphere depends on the length of its radius as V=(4/3)πr3.V=(4/3)πr3. Because Earth is not a perfect sphere, we can use the mean radius when measuring from the center to its surface. The mean radius is the average distance from the physical center to the surface, based on a large number of samples. Find the volume of Earth with mean radius 6.371×1066.371×106 m.

Since conversion rates fluctuate, when the tourist returns to the United States 2 weeks later, the conversion from Euros to U.S. dollars is D(x)=1.245x,D(x)=1.245x, where x is the number of Euros and D(x)D(x) is the equivalent number of U.S. dollars.

Linear Functions and Slope,"_paragraph_1
 The easiest type of function to consider is a linear function. Linear functions have the form f(x)=ax+b,f(x)=ax+b, where aa and bb are constants. In Figure 1.15, we see examples of linear functions when aa is positive, negative, and zero. Note that if a>0,a>0, the graph of the line rises as xx increases. In other words, f(x)=ax+bf(x)=ax+b is increasing on (−∞, ∞).(−∞, ∞). If a<0,a<0, the graph of the line falls as xx increases. In this case, f(x)=ax+bf(x)=ax+b is decreasing on (−∞, ∞).(−∞, ∞). If a=0,a=0, the line is horizontal.

 These linear functions are increasing or decreasing on (-∞, ∞)(-∞, ∞) and one function is a horizontal line.
_paragraph_19
 As suggested by Figure 1.15, the graph of any linear function is a line. One of the distinguishing features of a line is its slope. The slope is the change in yy for each unit change in x.x. The slope measures both the steepness and the direction of a line. If the slope is positive, the line points upward when moving from left to right. If the slope is negative, the line points downward when moving from left to right. If the slope is zero, the line is horizontal. To calculate the slope of a line, we need to determine the ratio of the change in yy versus the change in x.x. To do so, we choose any two points (x1,y1)(x1,y1) and (x2,y2)(x2,y2) on the line and calculate y2−y1x2−x1.y2−y1x2−x1. In Figure 1.16, we see this ratio is independent of the points chosen.

 For any linear function, the slope (y2−y1)/(x2−x1)(y2−y1)/(x2−x1) is independent of the choice of points (x1,y1)(x1,y1) and (x2,y2)(x2,y2) on the line.

 We now examine the relationship between slope and the formula for a linear function. Consider the linear function given by the formula f(x)=ax+b.f(x)=ax+b. As discussed earlier, we know the graph of a linear function is given by a line. We can use our definition of slope to calculate the slope of this line. As shown, we can determine the slope by calculating (y2−y1)/(x2−x1)(y2−y1)/(x2−x1) for any points (x1,y1)(x1,y1) and (x2,y2)(x2,y2) on the line. Evaluating the function ff at x=0,x=0, we see that (0,b)(0,b) is a point on this line. Evaluating this function at x=1,x=1, we see that (1,a+b)(1,a+b) is also a point on this line. Therefore, the slope of this line is
_paragraph_42
 f(x)=ax+b.f(x)=ax+b.

 We have shown that the coefficient aa is the slope of the line. We can conclude that the formula f(x)=ax+bf(x)=ax+b describes a line with slope a.a. Furthermore, because this line intersects the yy-axis at the point (0,b),(0,b), we see that the yy-intercept for this linear function is (0,b).(0,b). We conclude that the formula f(x)=ax+bf(x)=ax+b tells us the slope, a,a, and the yy-intercept, (0,b),(0,b), for this line. Since we often use the symbol mm to denote the slope of a line, we can write

 Sometimes it is convenient to express a linear function in different ways. For example, suppose the graph of a linear function passes through the point (x1,y1)(x1,y1) and the slope of the line is m.m. Since any other point (x,f(x))(x,f(x)) on the graph of ff must satisfy the equation

 Since every nonvertical line is the graph of a linear function, the points on a nonvertical line can be described using the slope-intercept or point-slope equations. However, a vertical line does not represent the graph of a function and cannot be expressed in either of these forms. Instead, a vertical line is described by the equation x=kx=k for some constant k.k. Since neither the slope-intercept form nor the point-slope form allows for vertical lines, we use the notation

In the case when n=0,n=0, we allow for a0=0;a0=0; if a0=0,a0=0, the function f(x)=0f(x)=0 is called the zero function. The value nn is called the degree of the polynomial; the constant anan is called the leading coefficient. A linear function of the form f(x)=mx+bf(x)=mx+b is a polynomial of degree 1 if m≠0m≠0 and degree 0 if m=0.m=0. A polynomial of degree 0 is also called a constant function. A polynomial function of degree 2 is called a quadratic function. In particular, a quadratic function has the form f(x)=ax2+bx+c,f(x)=ax2+bx+c, where a≠0.a≠0. A polynomial function of degree 33 is called a cubic function.

 Some polynomial functions are power functions. A power function is any function of the form f(x)=axb,f(x)=axb, where aa and bb are any real numbers. The exponent in a power function can be any real number, but here we consider the case when the exponent is a positive integer. (We consider other cases later.) If the exponent is a positive integer, then f(x)=axnf(x)=axn is a polynomial. If nn is even, then f(x)=axnf(x)=axn is an even function because f(−x)=a(−x)n=axnf(−x)=a(−x)n=axn if nn is even. If nn is odd, then f(x)=axnf(x)=axn is an odd function because f(−x)=a(−x)n=−axnf(−x)=a(−x)n=−axn if nn is odd (Figure 1.18).

 To determine the behavior of a function ff as the inputs approach infinity, we look at the values f(x)f(x) as the inputs, x,x, become larger. For some functions, the values of f(x)f(x) approach a finite number. For example, for the function f(x)=2+1/x,f(x)=2+1/x, the values 1/x1/x become closer and closer to zero for all values of xx as they get larger and larger. For this function, we say “f(x)“f(x) approaches two as xx goes to infinity,” and we write f(x)→2f(x)→2 as x→∞.x→∞. The line y=2y=2 is a horizontal asymptote for the function f(x)=2+1/xf(x)=2+1/x because the graph of the function gets closer to the line as xx gets larger.

 For other functions, the values f(x)f(x) may not approach a finite number but instead may become larger for all values of xx as they get larger. In that case, we say “f(x)“f(x) approaches infinity as xx approaches infinity,” and we write f(x)→∞f(x)→∞ as x→∞.x→∞. For example, for the function f(x)=3x2,f(x)=3x2, the outputs f(x)f(x) become larger as the inputs xx get larger. We can conclude that the function f(x)=3x2f(x)=3x2 approaches infinity as xx approaches infinity, and we write 3x2→∞3x2→∞ as x→∞.x→∞. The behavior as x→−∞x→−∞ and the meaning of f(x)→−∞f(x)→−∞ as x→∞x→∞ or x→−∞x→−∞ can be defined similarly. We can describe what happens to the values of f(x)f(x) as x→∞x→∞ and as x→−∞x→−∞ as the end behavior of the function.

 end behavior
_paragraph_79
 To understand the end behavior for polynomial functions, we can focus on quadratic and cubic functions. The behavior for higher-degree polynomials can be analyzed similarly. Consider a quadratic function f(x)=ax2+bx+c.f(x)=ax2+bx+c. If a>0,a>0, the values f(x)→∞f(x)→∞ as x→±∞.x→±∞. If a<0,a<0, the values f(x)→−∞f(x)→−∞ as x→±∞.x→±∞. Since the graph of a quadratic function is a parabola, the parabola opens upward if a>0;a>0; the parabola opens downward if a<0.a<0. (See Figure 1.19(a).)

If a<0,a<0, then f(x)→−∞f(x)→−∞ as x→∞x→∞ and f(x)→∞f(x)→∞ as x→−∞.x→−∞. As we can see from both of these graphs, the leading term of the polynomial determines the end behavior. (See Figure 1.19(b).)

 Another characteristic of the graph of a polynomial function is where it intersects the xx-axis. To determine where a function ff intersects the xx-axis, we need to solve the equation f(x)=0f(x)=0 for x. In the case of the linear function f(x)=mx+b,f(x)=mx+b, the xx-intercept is given by solving the equation mx+b=0.mx+b=0. In this case, we see that the xx-intercept is given by (−b/m,0).(−b/m,0). In the case of a quadratic function, finding the xx-intercept(s) requires finding the zeros of a quadratic equation: ax2+bx+c=0.ax2+bx+c=0. In some cases, it is easy to factor the polynomial ax2+bx+cax2+bx+c to find the zeros. If not, we make use of the quadratic formula.

Power Functions,"_paragraph_1
 Some polynomial functions are power functions. A power function is any function of the form f(x)=axb,f(x)=axb, where aa and bb are any real numbers. The exponent in a power function can be any real number, but here we consider the case when the exponent is a positive integer. (We consider other cases later.) If the exponent is a positive integer, then f(x)=axnf(x)=axn is a polynomial. If nn is even, then f(x)=axnf(x)=axn is an even function because f(−x)=a(−x)n=axnf(−x)=a(−x)n=axn if nn is even. If nn is odd, then f(x)=axnf(x)=axn is an odd function because f(−x)=a(−x)n=−axnf(−x)=a(−x)n=−axn if nn is odd (Figure 1.18).

Behavior at Infinity,"_paragraph_1
 To determine the behavior of a function ff as the inputs approach infinity, we look at the values f(x)f(x) as the inputs, x,x, become larger. For some functions, the values of f(x)f(x) approach a finite number. For example, for the function f(x)=2+1/x,f(x)=2+1/x, the values 1/x1/x become closer and closer to zero for all values of xx as they get larger and larger. For this function, we say “f(x)“f(x) approaches two as xx goes to infinity,” and we write f(x)→2f(x)→2 as x→∞.x→∞. The line y=2y=2 is a horizontal asymptote for the function f(x)=2+1/xf(x)=2+1/x because the graph of the function gets closer to the line as xx gets larger.

 For other functions, the values f(x)f(x) may not approach a finite number but instead may become larger for all values of xx as they get larger. In that case, we say “f(x)“f(x) approaches infinity as xx approaches infinity,” and we write f(x)→∞f(x)→∞ as x→∞.x→∞. For example, for the function f(x)=3x2,f(x)=3x2, the outputs f(x)f(x) become larger as the inputs xx get larger. We can conclude that the function f(x)=3x2f(x)=3x2 approaches infinity as xx approaches infinity, and we write 3x2→∞3x2→∞ as x→∞.x→∞. The behavior as x→−∞x→−∞ and the meaning of f(x)→−∞f(x)→−∞ as x→∞x→∞ or x→−∞x→−∞ can be defined similarly. We can describe what happens to the values of f(x)f(x) as x→∞x→∞ and as x→−∞x→−∞ as the end behavior of the function.

 To understand the end behavior for polynomial functions, we can focus on quadratic and cubic functions. The behavior for higher-degree polynomials can be analyzed similarly. Consider a quadratic function f(x)=ax2+bx+c.f(x)=ax2+bx+c. If a>0,a>0, the values f(x)→∞f(x)→∞ as x→±∞.x→±∞. If a<0,a<0, the values f(x)→−∞f(x)→−∞ as x→±∞.x→±∞. Since the graph of a quadratic function is a parabola, the parabola opens upward if a>0;a>0; the parabola opens downward if a<0.a<0. (See Figure 1.19(a).)

If a<0,a<0, then f(x)→−∞f(x)→−∞ as x→∞x→∞ and f(x)→∞f(x)→∞ as x→−∞.x→−∞. As we can see from both of these graphs, the leading term of the polynomial determines the end behavior. (See Figure 1.19(b).)

 are rational functions. A root function is a power function of the form f(x)=x1/n,f(x)=x1/n, where nn is a positive integer greater than one. For example, f(x)=x1/2=xf(x)=x1/2=x is the square-root function and g(x)=x1/3=x3g(x)=x1/3=x3 is the cube-root function. By allowing for compositions of root functions and rational functions, we can create other algebraic functions. For example, f(x)=4−x2f(x)=4−x2 is an algebraic function.

 The root functions f(x)=x1/nf(x)=x1/n have defining characteristics depending on whether nn is odd or even.

Transcendental Functions,"_paragraph_1
 Thus far, we have discussed algebraic functions. Some functions, however, cannot be described by basic algebraic operations. These functions are known as transcendental functions because they are said to “transcend,” or go beyond, algebra. The most common transcendental functions are trigonometric, exponential, and logarithmic functions. A trigonometric function relates the ratios of two sides of a right triangle. They are sinx,cosx,tanx,cotx,secx,andcscx.sinx,cosx,tanx,cotx,secx,andcscx. (We discuss trigonometric functions later in the chapter.) An exponential function is a function of the form f(x)=bx,f(x)=bx, where the base b>0,b≠1.b>0,b≠1. A logarithmic function is a function of the form f(x)=logb(x)f(x)=logb(x) for some constant b>0,b≠1,b>0,b≠1, where logb(x)=ylogb(x)=y if and only if by=x.by=x. (We also discuss exponential and logarithmic functions later in the chapter.)

Piecewise-Defined Functions,"_paragraph_1
 Sometimes a function is defined by different formulas on different parts of its domain. A function with this property is known as a piecewise-defined function. The absolute value function is an example of a piecewise-defined function because the formula changes with the sign of x:x:
_paragraph_2

_paragraph_3
 x:x:
_paragraph_4
 Other piecewise-defined functions may be represented by completely different formulas, depending on the part of the domain in which a point falls. To graph a piecewise-defined function, we graph each part of the function in its respective domain, on the same coordinate system. If the formula for a function is different for x<ax<a and x>a,x>a, we need to pay special attention to what happens at x=ax=a when we graph the function. Sometimes the graph needs to include an open or closed circle to indicate the value of the function at x=a.x=a. We examine this in the next example.

Since the value of the function at x=1x=1 is given by the formula f(x)=(x−2)2,f(x)=(x−2)2, we see that f(1)=1.f(1)=1. To indicate this on the graph, we draw a closed circle at the point (1,1).(1,1). The value of the function is given by f(x)=x+3f(x)=x+3 for all x<1,x<1, but not at x=1.x=1. To indicate this on the graph, we draw an open circle at (1,4).(1,4).

Transformations of Functions,"_paragraph_1
 We have seen several cases in which we have added, subtracted, or multiplied constants to form variations of simple functions. In the previous example, for instance, we subtracted 2 from the argument of the function y=x2y=x2 to get the function f(x)=(x−2)2.f(x)=(x−2)2. This subtraction represents a shift of the function y=x2y=x2 two units to the right. A shift, horizontally or vertically, is a type of transformation of a function. Other transformations include horizontal and vertical scalings, and reflections about the axes.

 A vertical shift of a function occurs if we add or subtract the same constant to each output y.y. For c>0,c>0, the graph of f(x)+cf(x)+c is a shift of the graph of f(x)f(x) up cc units, whereas the graph of f(x)−cf(x)−c is a shift of the graph of f(x)f(x) down cc units. For example, the graph of the function f(x)=x2+4f(x)=x2+4 is the graph of y=x2y=x2 shifted up 44 units; the graph of the function f(x)=x2−4f(x)=x2−4 is the graph of y=x2y=x2 shifted down 44 units (Figure 1.23).

Why does the graph shift left when adding a constant and shift right when subtracting a constant? To answer this question, let’s look at an example.

 A vertical scaling of a graph occurs if we multiply all outputs yy of a function by the same positive constant. For c>0,c>0, the graph of the function cf(x)cf(x) is the graph of f(x)f(x) scaled vertically by a factor of c.c. If c>1,c>1, the values of the outputs for the function cf(x)cf(x) are larger than the values of the outputs for the function f(x);f(x); therefore, the graph has been stretched vertically. If 0<c<1,0<c<1, then the outputs of the function cf(x)cf(x) are smaller, so the graph has been compressed. For example, the graph of the function f(x)=3x2f(x)=3x2 is the graph of y=x2y=x2 stretched vertically by a factor of 3, whereas the graph of f(x)=x2/3f(x)=x2/3 is the graph of y=x2y=x2 compressed vertically by a factor of 33 (Figure 1.25).

 The horizontal scaling of a function occurs if we multiply the inputs xx by the same positive constant. For c>0,c>0, the graph of the function f(cx)f(cx) is the graph of f(x)f(x) scaled horizontally by a factor of c.c. If c>1,c>1, the graph of f(cx)f(cx) is the graph of f(x)f(x) compressed horizontally. If 0<c<1,0<c<1, the graph of f(cx)f(cx) is the graph of f(x)f(x) stretched horizontally. For example, consider the function f(x)=2xf(x)=2x and evaluate ff at x/2.x/2. Since f(x/2)=x,f(x/2)=x, the graph of f(x)=2xf(x)=2x is the graph of y=xy=x compressed horizontally.

 We have explored what happens to the graph of a function ff when we multiply ff by a constant c>0c>0 to get a new function cf(x).cf(x). We have also discussed what happens to the graph of a function ff when we multiply the independent variable xx by c>0c>0 to get a new function f(cx).f(cx). However, we have not addressed what happens to the graph of the function if the constant cc is negative. If we have a constant c<0,c<0, we can write c as a positive number multiplied by −1;−1; but, what kind of transformation do we get when we multiply the function or its argument by −1?−1? When we multiply all the outputs by −1,−1, we get a reflection about the xx-axis. When we multiply all inputs by −1,−1, we get a reflection about the yy-axis. For example, the graph of f(x)=−(x3+1)f(x)=−(x3+1) is the graph of y=(x3+1)y=(x3+1) reflected about the xx-axis. The graph of f(x)=(−x)3+1f(x)=(−x)3+1 is the graph of y=x3+1y=x3+1 reflected about the yy-axis (Figure 1.27).

 If the graph of a function consists of more than one transformation of another graph, it is important to transform the graph in the correct order. Given a function f(x),f(x), the graph of the related function y=cf(a(x+b))+dy=cf(a(x+b))+d can be obtained from the graph of y=f(x)y=f(x) by performing the transformations in the following order.

Radian Measure,"_paragraph_1
 To use trigonometric functions, we first must understand how to measure the angles. Although we can use both radians and degrees, radians are a more natural measurement because they are related directly to the unit circle, a circle with radius 1. The radian measure of an angle is defined as follows. Given an angle θ,θ, let ss be the length of the corresponding arc on the unit circle (Figure 1.30). We say the angle corresponding to the arc of length 1 has radian measure 1.

 Since an angle of 360°360° corresponds to the circumference of a circle, or an arc of length 2π,2π, we conclude that an angle with a degree measure of 360°360° has a radian measure of 2π.2π. Similarly, we see that 180°180° is equivalent to ππ radians. Table 1.8 shows the relationship between common degree and radian values.

The Six Basic Trigonometric Functions,"_paragraph_1
 Trigonometric functions allow us to use angle measures, in radians or degrees, to find the coordinates of a point on any circle—not only on a unit circle—or to find an angle given a point on a circle. They also define the relationship among the sides and angles of a triangle.
_paragraph_2
 To define the trigonometric functions, first consider the unit circle centered at the origin and a point P=(x,y)P=(x,y) on the unit circle. Let θθ be an angle with an initial side that lies along the positive xx-axis and with a terminal side that is the line segment OP.OP. An angle in this position is said to be in standard position (Figure 1.31). We can then define the values of the six trigonometric functions for θθ in terms of the coordinates xx and y.y.

Let θθ be one of the acute angles. Let AA be the length of the adjacent leg, OO be the length of the opposite leg, and HH be the length of the hypotenuse. By inscribing the triangle into a circle of radius H,H, as shown in Figure 1.33, we see that A,H,A,H, and OO satisfy the following relationships with θ:θ:

Graphs and Periods of the Trigonometric Functions,"_paragraph_1
 We have seen that as we travel around the unit circle, the values of the trigonometric functions repeat. We can see this pattern in the graphs of the functions. Let P=(x,y)P=(x,y) be a point on the unit circle and let θθ be the corresponding angle .. Since the angle θθ and θ+2πθ+2π correspond to the same point P,P, the values of the trigonometric functions at θθ and at θ+2πθ+2π are the same. Consequently, the trigonometric functions are periodic functions. The period of a function ff is defined to be the smallest positive value pp such that f(x+p)=f(x)f(x+p)=f(x) for all values xx in the domain of f.f. The sine, cosine, secant, and cosecant functions have a period of 2π.2π. Since the tangent and cotangent functions repeat on an interval of length π,π, their period is ππ (Figure 1.34).

Existence of an Inverse Function,"_paragraph_1
 We begin with an example. Given a function ff and an output y=f(x),y=f(x), we are often interested in finding what value or values xx were mapped to yy by f.f. For example, consider the function f(x)=x3+4.f(x)=x3+4. Since any output y=x3+4,y=x3+4, we can solve this equation for xx to find that the input is x=y−43.x=y−43. This equation defines xx as a function of y.y. Denoting this function as f−1,f−1, and writing x=f−1(y)=y−43,x=f−1(y)=y−43, we see that for any xx in the domain of f,f−1(f(x))=f−1(x3+4)=x.f,f−1(f(x))=f−1(x3+4)=x. Thus, this new function, f−1,f−1, “undid” what the original function ff did. A function with this property is called the inverse function of the original function.

 Given a function ff and its inverse f−1,f−1(y)=xf−1,f−1(y)=x if and only if f(x)=y.f(x)=y. The range of ff becomes the domain of f−1f−1 and the domain of ff becomes the range of f−1.f−1.
_paragraph_41
 Recall that a function has exactly one output for each input. Therefore, to define an inverse function, we need to map each input to exactly one output. For example, let’s try to find the inverse function for f(x)=x2.f(x)=x2. Solving the equation y=x2y=x2 for x,x, we arrive at the equation x=±y.x=±y. This equation does not describe xx as a function of yy because there are two solutions to this equation for every y>0.y>0. The problem with trying to find an inverse function for f(x)=x2f(x)=x2 is that two inputs are sent to the same output for each output y>0.y>0. The function f(x)=x3+4f(x)=x3+4 discussed earlier did not have this problem. For that function, each input was sent to a different output. A function that sends each input to a different output is called a one-to-one function.

 One way to determine whether a function is one-to-one is by looking at its graph. If a function is one-to-one, then no two inputs can be sent to the same output. Therefore, if we draw a horizontal line anywhere in the xyxy-plane, according to the horizontal line test, it cannot intersect the graph more than once. We note that the horizontal line test is different from the vertical line test. The vertical line test determines whether a graph is the graph of a function. The horizontal line test determines whether a function is one-to-one (Figure 1.38).

Finding a Function’s Inverse,"_paragraph_1
 We can now consider one-to-one functions and show how to find their inverses. Recall that a function maps elements in the domain of ff to elements in the range of f.f. The inverse function maps each element from the range of ff back to its corresponding element from the domain of f.f. Therefore, to find the inverse function of a one-to-one function f,f, given any yy in the range of f,f, we need to determine which xx in the domain of ff satisfies f(x)=y.f(x)=y. Since ff is one-to-one, there is exactly one such value x.x. We can find that value xx by solving the equation f(x)=yf(x)=y for x.x. Doing so, we are able to write xx as a function of yy where the domain of this function is the range of ff and the range of this new function is the domain of f.f. Consequently, this function is the inverse of f,f, and we write x=f−1(y).x=f−1(y). Since we typically use the variable xx to denote the independent variable and yy to denote the dependent variable, we often interchange the roles of xx and y,y, and write y=f−1(x).y=f−1(x). Representing the inverse function in this way is also helpful later when we graph a function ff and its inverse f−1f−1 on the same axes.

 Step 2. Rewrite as y=13x+43y=13x+43 and let y=f−1(x).y=f−1(x).
_paragraph_44
 y=13x+43y=13x+43
_paragraph_45
 y=f−1(x).y=f−1(x).

 As we have seen, f(x)=x2f(x)=x2 does not have an inverse function because it is not one-to-one. However, we can choose a subset of the domain of ff such that the function is one-to-one. This subset is called a restricted domain. By restricting the domain of f,f, we can define a new function gg such that the domain of gg is the restricted domain of ff and g(x)=f(x)g(x)=f(x) for all xx in the domain of g.g. Then we can define an inverse function for gg on that domain. For example, since f(x)=x2f(x)=x2 is one-to-one on the interval [0,∞),[0,∞), we can define a new function gg such that the domain of gg is [0,∞)[0,∞) and g(x)=x2g(x)=x2 for all xx in its domain. Since gg is a one-to-one function, it has an inverse function, given by the formula g−1(x)=x.g−1(x)=x. On the other hand, the function f(x)=x2f(x)=x2 is also one-to-one on the domain (−∞,0].(−∞,0]. Therefore, we could also define a new function hh such that the domain of hh is (−∞,0](−∞,0] and h(x)=x2h(x)=x2 for all xx in the domain of h.h. Then hh is a one-to-one function and must also have an inverse. Its inverse is given by the formula h−1(x)=−xh−1(x)=−x (Figure 1.40).

Restricting Domains,"_paragraph_1
 As we have seen, f(x)=x2f(x)=x2 does not have an inverse function because it is not one-to-one. However, we can choose a subset of the domain of ff such that the function is one-to-one. This subset is called a restricted domain. By restricting the domain of f,f, we can define a new function gg such that the domain of gg is the restricted domain of ff and g(x)=f(x)g(x)=f(x) for all xx in the domain of g.g. Then we can define an inverse function for gg on that domain. For example, since f(x)=x2f(x)=x2 is one-to-one on the interval [0,∞),[0,∞), we can define a new function gg such that the domain of gg is [0,∞)[0,∞) and g(x)=x2g(x)=x2 for all xx in its domain. Since gg is a one-to-one function, it has an inverse function, given by the formula g−1(x)=x.g−1(x)=x. On the other hand, the function f(x)=x2f(x)=x2 is also one-to-one on the domain (−∞,0].(−∞,0]. Therefore, we could also define a new function hh such that the domain of hh is (−∞,0](−∞,0] and h(x)=x2h(x)=x2 for all xx in the domain of h.h. Then hh is a one-to-one function and must also have an inverse. Its inverse is given by the formula h−1(x)=−xh−1(x)=−x (Figure 1.40).

Inverse Trigonometric Functions,"_paragraph_1
 The six basic trigonometric functions are periodic, and therefore they are not one-to-one. However, if we restrict the domain of a trigonometric function to an interval where it is one-to-one, we can define its inverse. Consider the sine function (Figure 1.34). The sine function is one-to-one on an infinite number of intervals, but the standard convention is to restrict the domain to the interval [−π2,π2].[−π2,π2]. By doing so, we define the inverse sine function on the domain [−1,1][−1,1] such that for any xx in the interval [−1,1],[−1,1], the inverse sine function tells us which angle θθ in the interval [−π2,π2][−π2,π2] satisfies sinθ=x.sinθ=x. Similarly, we can restrict the domains of the other trigonometric functions to define inverse trigonometric functions, which are functions that tell us which angle in a certain interval has a specified trigonometric value.

 When evaluating an inverse trigonometric function, the output is an angle. For example, to evaluate cos−1(12),cos−1(12), we need to find an angle θθ such that cosθ=12.cosθ=12. Clearly, many angles have this property. However, given the definition of cos−1,cos−1, we need the angle θθ that not only solves this equation, but also lies in the interval [0,π].[0,π]. We conclude that cos−1(12)=π3.cos−1(12)=π3.

 We now consider a composition of a trigonometric function and its inverse. For example, consider the two expressions sin(sin−1(22))sin(sin−1(22)) and sin−1(sin(π)).sin−1(sin(π)). For the first one, we simplify as follows:
_paragraph_42
 sin(sin−1(22))sin(sin−1(22))
_paragraph_43
 sin−1(sin(π)).sin−1(sin(π)).
_paragraph_44
 For the second one, we have
_paragraph_45
 The inverse function is supposed to “undo” the original function, so why isn’t sin−1(sin(π))=π?sin−1(sin(π))=π? Recalling our definition of inverse functions, a function ff and its inverse f−1f−1 satisfy the conditions f(f−1(y))=yf(f−1(y))=y for all yy in the domain of f−1f−1 and f−1(f(x))=xf−1(f(x))=x for all xx in the domain of f,f, so what happened here? The issue is that the inverse sine function, sin−1,sin−1, is the inverse of the restricted sine function defined on the domain [−π2,π2].[−π2,π2]. Therefore, for xx in the interval [−π2,π2],[−π2,π2], it is true that sin−1(sinx)=x.sin−1(sinx)=x. However, for values of xx outside this interval, the equation does not hold, even though sin−1(sinx)sin−1(sinx) is defined for all real numbers x.x.

 What about sin(sin−1y)?sin(sin−1y)? Does that have a similar issue? The answer is no. Since the domain of sin−1sin−1 is the interval [−1,1],[−1,1], we conclude that sin(sin−1y)=ysin(sin−1y)=y if −1≤y≤1−1≤y≤1 and the expression is not defined for other values of y.y. To summarize,

 The Maximum Value of a Function
_paragraph_80
 In many areas of science, engineering, and mathematics, it is useful to know the maximum value a function can obtain, even if we don’t know its exact value at a given instant. For instance, if we have a function describing the strength of a roof beam, we would want to know the maximum weight the beam can support without breaking. If we have a function that describes the speed of a train, we would want to know its maximum speed before it jumps off the rails. Safe design often depends on knowing maximum values.
_paragraph_81
 This project describes a simple example of a function with a maximum value that depends on two equation coefficients. We will see that maximum values can depend on several factors other than the independent variable x.

 To see the difference between an exponential function and a power function, we compare the functions y=x2y=x2 and y=2x.y=2x. In Table 1.10, we see that both 2x2x and x2x2 approach infinity as x→∞.x→∞. Eventually, however, 2x2x becomes larger than x2x2 and grows more rapidly as x→∞.x→∞. In the opposite direction, as x→−∞,x2→∞,x→−∞,x2→∞, whereas 2x→0.2x→0. The line y=0y=0 is a horizontal asymptote for y=2x.y=2x.

 Recall the properties of exponents: If xx is a positive integer, then we define bx=b·b⋯bbx=b·b⋯b (with xx factors of b).b). If xx is a negative integer, then x=−yx=−y for some positive integer y,y, and we define bx=b−y=1/by.bx=b−y=1/by. Also, b0b0 is defined to be 1.1. If xx is a rational number, then x=p/q,x=p/q, where pp and qq are integers and bx=bp/q=bpq.bx=bp/q=bpq. For example, 93/2=93=27.93/2=93=27. However, how is bxbx defined if xx is an irrational number? For example, what do we mean by 22?22? This is too complex a question for us to answer fully right now; however, we can make an approximation. In Table 1.11, we list some rational numbers approaching 2,2, and the values of 2x2x for each rational number xx are presented as well. We claim that if we choose rational numbers xx getting closer and closer to 2,2, the values of 2x2x get closer and closer to some number L.L. We define that number LL to be 22.22.

The number of bacteria after 88 hours is n(8)=n(4)·2=1000·22.n(8)=n(4)·2=1000·22. In general, the number of bacteria after 4m4m hours is n(4m)=1000·2m.n(4m)=1000·2m. Letting t=4m,t=4m, we see that the number of bacteria after tt hours is n(t)=1000·2t/4.n(t)=1000·2t/4. Find the number of bacteria after 66 hours, 1010 hours, and 2424 hours.

 For any base b>0,b≠1,b>0,b≠1, the exponential function f(x)=bxf(x)=bx is defined for all real numbers xx and bx>0.bx>0. Therefore, the domain of f(x)=bxf(x)=bx is (−∞,∞)(−∞,∞) and the range is (0,∞).(0,∞). To graph bx,bx, we note that for b>1,bxb>1,bx is increasing on (−∞,∞)(−∞,∞) and bx→∞bx→∞ as x→∞,x→∞, whereas bx→0bx→0 as x→−∞.x→−∞.

Evaluating Exponential Functions,"_paragraph_1
 Recall the properties of exponents: If xx is a positive integer, then we define bx=b·b⋯bbx=b·b⋯b (with xx factors of b).b). If xx is a negative integer, then x=−yx=−y for some positive integer y,y, and we define bx=b−y=1/by.bx=b−y=1/by. Also, b0b0 is defined to be 1.1. If xx is a rational number, then x=p/q,x=p/q, where pp and qq are integers and bx=bp/q=bpq.bx=bp/q=bpq. For example, 93/2=93=27.93/2=93=27. However, how is bxbx defined if xx is an irrational number? For example, what do we mean by 22?22? This is too complex a question for us to answer fully right now; however, we can make an approximation. In Table 1.11, we list some rational numbers approaching 2,2, and the values of 2x2x for each rational number xx are presented as well. We claim that if we choose rational numbers xx getting closer and closer to 2,2, the values of 2x2x get closer and closer to some number L.L. We define that number LL to be 22.22.

 Suppose a particular population of bacteria is known to double in size every 44 hours. If a culture starts with 10001000 bacteria, the number of bacteria after 44 hours is n(4)=1000·2.n(4)=1000·2. The number of bacteria after 88 hours is n(8)=n(4)·2=1000·22.n(8)=n(4)·2=1000·22. In general, the number of bacteria after 4m4m hours is n(4m)=1000·2m.n(4m)=1000·2m.

Graphing Exponential Functions,"_paragraph_1
 For any base b>0,b≠1,b>0,b≠1, the exponential function f(x)=bxf(x)=bx is defined for all real numbers xx and bx>0.bx>0. Therefore, the domain of f(x)=bxf(x)=bx is (−∞,∞)(−∞,∞) and the range is (0,∞).(0,∞). To graph bx,bx, we note that for b>1,bxb>1,bx is increasing on (−∞,∞)(−∞,∞) and bx→∞bx→∞ as x→∞,x→∞, whereas bx→0bx→0 as x→−∞.x→−∞.

 A special type of exponential function appears frequently in real-world applications.

 Returning to our savings account example, we can conclude that if a person puts PP dollars in an account at an annual interest rate r,r, compounded continuously, then A(t)=Pert.A(t)=Pert. This function may be familiar. Since functions involving base ee arise often in applications, we call the function f(x)=exf(x)=ex the natural exponential function. Not only is this function interesting because of the definition of the number e,e, but also, as discussed next, its graph has an important property.

We give a precise definition of tangent line in the next chapter; but, informally, we say a tangent line to a graph of ff at x=ax=a is a line that passes through the point (a,f(a))(a,f(a)) and has the same “slope” as ff at that point .. The function f(x)=exf(x)=ex is the only exponential function bxbx with tangent line at x=0x=0 that has a slope of 1. As we see later in the text, having this property makes the natural exponential function the most simple exponential function to use in many instances.

Logarithmic Functions,"_paragraph_1
 Using our understanding of exponential functions, we can discuss their inverses, which are the logarithmic functions. These come in handy when we need to consider any phenomenon that varies over a wide range of values, such as pH in chemistry or decibels in sound levels.
_paragraph_2
 The exponential function f(x)=bxf(x)=bx is one-to-one, with domain (−∞,∞)(−∞,∞) and range (0,∞).(0,∞). Therefore, it has an inverse function, called the logarithmic function with base b.b. For any b>0,b≠1,b>0,b≠1, the logarithmic function with base b, denoted logb,logb, has domain (0,∞)(0,∞) and range (−∞,∞),(−∞,∞), and satisfies

 The most commonly used logarithmic function is the function loge.loge. Since this function uses natural ee as its base, it is called the natural logarithm. Here we use the notation ln(x)ln(x) or lnxlnx to mean loge(x).loge(x). For example,

 When evaluating a logarithmic function with a calculator, you may have noticed that the only options are log10log10 or log, called the common logarithm, or ln, which is the natural logarithm. However, exponential functions and logarithm functions can be expressed in terms of any desired base b.b. If you need to use a calculator to evaluate an expression with a different base, you can apply the change-of-base formulas first. Using this change of base, we typically write a given exponential or logarithmic function in terms of the natural exponential and natural logarithmic functions.

 For the first change-of-base formula, we begin by making use of the power property of logarithmic functions. We know that for any base b>0,b≠1,logb(ax)=xlogba.b>0,b≠1,logb(ax)=xlogba. Therefore,
_paragraph_74
 b>0,b≠1,logb(ax)=xlogba.b>0,b≠1,logb(ax)=xlogba.
_paragraph_75
 In addition, we know that bxbx and logb(x)logb(x) are inverse functions. Therefore,
_paragraph_76
 bxbx
_paragraph_77
 logb(x)logb(x)
_paragraph_78
 Combining these last two equalities, we conclude that ax=bxlogba.ax=bxlogba.
_paragraph_79
 ax=bxlogba.ax=bxlogba.

 To prove the second property, we show that
_paragraph_81
 Let u=logba,v=logax,u=logba,v=logax, and w=logbx.w=logbx. We will show that u·v=w.u·v=w. By the definition of logarithmic functions, we know that bu=a,av=x,bu=a,av=x, and bw=x.bw=x. From the previous equations, we see that

 In 1935, Charles Richter developed a scale (now known as the Richter scale) to measure the magnitude of an earthquake. The scale is a base-10 logarithmic scale, and it can be described as follows: Consider one earthquake with magnitude R1R1 on the Richter scale and a second earthquake with magnitude R2R2 on the Richter scale. Suppose R1>R2,R1>R2, which means the earthquake of magnitude R1R1 is stronger, but how much stronger is it than the other earthquake? A way of measuring the intensity of an earthquake is by using a seismograph to measure the amplitude of the earthquake waves. If A1A1 is the amplitude measured for the first earthquake and A2A2 is the amplitude measured for the second earthquake, then the amplitudes and magnitudes of the two earthquakes satisfy the following equation:

On the other hand, if one earthquake measures 8 on the Richter scale and another measures 6, then the relative intensity of the two earthquakes satisfies the equation
_paragraph_122
 A1/A2=10A1/A2=10

Proof,"_paragraph_1
 For the first change-of-base formula, we begin by making use of the power property of logarithmic functions. We know that for any base b>0,b≠1,logb(ax)=xlogba.b>0,b≠1,logb(ax)=xlogba. Therefore,
_paragraph_2
 b>0,b≠1,logb(ax)=xlogba.b>0,b≠1,logb(ax)=xlogba.
_paragraph_3
 In addition, we know that bxbx and logb(x)logb(x) are inverse functions. Therefore,
_paragraph_4
 bxbx
_paragraph_5
 logb(x)logb(x)
_paragraph_6
 Combining these last two equalities, we conclude that ax=bxlogba.ax=bxlogba.
_paragraph_7
 ax=bxlogba.ax=bxlogba.
_paragraph_8
 To prove the second property, we show that
_paragraph_9
 Let u=logba,v=logax,u=logba,v=logax, and w=logbx.w=logbx. We will show that u·v=w.u·v=w. By the definition of logarithmic functions, we know that bu=a,av=x,bu=a,av=x, and bw=x.bw=x. From the previous equations, we see that
_paragraph_10
 u=logba,v=logax,u=logba,v=logax,
_paragraph_11
 w=logbx.w=logbx.
_paragraph_12
 u·v=w.u·v=w.
_paragraph_13
 bu=a,av=x,bu=a,av=x,
_paragraph_14
 bw=x.bw=x.
_paragraph_15
 Therefore, buv=bw.buv=bw. Since exponential functions are one-to-one, we can conclude that u·v=w.u·v=w.

 buv=bw.buv=bw.

Hyperbolic Functions,"_paragraph_1
 The hyperbolic functions are defined in terms of certain combinations of exex and e−x.e−x. These functions arise naturally in various engineering and physics applications, including the study of water waves and vibrations of elastic membranes. Another common use for a hyperbolic function is the representation of a hanging chain or cable, also known as a catenary (Figure 1.49). If we introduce a coordinate system so that the low point of the chain lies along the yy-axis, we can describe the height of the chain in terms of a hyperbolic function. First, we define the hyperbolic functions.

 Using the definition of cosh(x)cosh(x) and principles of physics, it can be shown that the height of a hanging chain, such as the one in Figure 1.49, can be described by the function h(x)=acosh(x/a)+ch(x)=acosh(x/a)+c for certain constants aa and c.c.

 To graph coshxcoshx and sinhx,sinhx, we make use of the fact that both functions approach (1/2)ex(1/2)ex as x→∞,x→∞, since e−x→0e−x→0 as x→∞.x→∞. As x→−∞,coshxx→−∞,coshx approaches 1/2e−x,1/2e−x, whereas sinhxsinhx approaches −1/2e−x.−1/2e−x. Therefore, using the graphs of 1/2ex,1/2e−x,1/2ex,1/2e−x, and −1/2e−x−1/2e−x as guides, we graph coshxcoshx and sinhx.sinhx.

As x→−∞,coshxx→−∞,coshx approaches 1/2e−x,1/2e−x, whereas sinhxsinhx approaches −1/2e−x.−1/2e−x. Therefore, using the graphs of 1/2ex,1/2e−x,1/2ex,1/2e−x, and −1/2e−x−1/2e−x as guides, we graph coshxcoshx and sinhx.sinhx. To graph tanhx,tanhx, we use the fact that tanh(0)=0,−1<tanh(x)<1tanh(0)=0,−1<tanh(x)<1 for all x,tanhx→1x,tanhx→1 as x→∞,x→∞, and tanhx→−1tanhx→−1 as x→−∞.x→−∞. The graphs of the other three hyperbolic functions can be sketched using the graphs of coshx,sinhx,coshx,sinhx, and tanhxtanhx (Figure 1.51).

Identities Involving Hyperbolic Functions,"_paragraph_1
 The identity cosh2t−sinh2t,cosh2t−sinh2t, shown in Figure 1.50, is one of several identities involving the hyperbolic functions, some of which are listed next. The first four properties follow easily from the definitions of hyperbolic sine and hyperbolic cosine. Except for some differences in signs, most of these properties are analogous to identities for trigonometric functions.

Inverse Hyperbolic Functions,"_paragraph_1
 From the graphs of the hyperbolic functions, we see that all of them are one-to-one except coshxcoshx and sechx.sechx. If we restrict the domains of these two functions to the interval [0,∞),[0,∞), then all the hyperbolic functions are one-to-one, and we can define the inverse hyperbolic functions. Since the hyperbolic functions themselves involve exponential functions, the inverse hyperbolic functions involve logarithmic functions.

 Inverse Hyperbolic Functions
_paragraph_8
 Let’s look at how to derive the first equation. The others follow similarly. Suppose y=sinh−1x.y=sinh−1x. Then, x=sinhyx=sinhy and, by the definition of the hyperbolic sine function, x=ey−e−y2.x=ey−e−y2. Therefore,
_paragraph_9
 y=sinh−1x.y=sinh−1x.
_paragraph_10
 x=sinhyx=sinhy
_paragraph_11
 x=ey−e−y2.x=ey−e−y2.
_paragraph_12
 Multiplying this equation by ey,ey, we obtain
_paragraph_13
 ey,ey,
_paragraph_14
 This can be solved like a quadratic equation, with the solution
_paragraph_15
 Since ey>0,ey>0, the only solution is the one with the positive sign. Applying the natural logarithm to both sides of the equation, we conclude that
_paragraph_16
 ey>0,ey>0,

 A function is a mapping from a set of inputs to a set of outputs with exactly one output for each input.
If no domain is stated for a function y=f(x),y=f(x), the domain is considered to be the set of all real numbers xx for which the function is defined.
When sketching the graph of a function f,f, each vertical line may intersect the graph, at most, once.
A function may have any number of zeros, but it has, at most, one y-intercept.
To define the composition g∘f,g∘f, the range of ff must be contained in the domain of g.g.
Even functions are symmetric about the yy-axis whereas odd functions are symmetric about the origin.",,

 The power function f(x)=xnf(x)=xn is an even function if nn is even and n≠0,n≠0, and it is an odd function if nn is odd.
The root function f(x)=x1/nf(x)=x1/n has the domain [0,∞)[0,∞) if nn is even and the domain (−∞,∞)(−∞,∞) if nn is odd. If nn is odd, then f(x)=x1/nf(x)=x1/n is an odd function.
The domain of the rational function f(x)=p(x)/q(x),f(x)=p(x)/q(x), where p(x)p(x) and q(x)q(x) are polynomial functions, is the set of xx such that q(x)≠0.q(x)≠0.
Functions that involve the basic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and powers are algebraic functions. All other functions are transcendental. Trigonometric, exponential, and logarithmic functions are examples of transcendental functions.
A polynomial function ff with degree n≥1n≥1 satisfies f(x)→±∞f(x)→±∞ as x→±∞.x→±∞. The sign of the output as x→∞x→∞ depends on the sign of the leading coefficient only and on whether nn is even or odd.
Vertical and horizontal shifts, vertical and horizontal scalings, and reflections about the xx- and yy-axes are examples of transformations of functions.",,

 Radian measure is defined such that the angle associated with the arc of length 1 on the unit circle has radian measure 1. An angle with a degree measure of 180°180° has a radian measure of ππ rad.
For acute angles θ,θ, the values of the trigonometric functions are defined as ratios of two sides of a right triangle in which one of the acute angles is θ.θ.
For a general angle θ,θ, let (x,y)(x,y) be a point on a circle of radius rr corresponding to this angle θ.θ. The trigonometric functions can be written as ratios involving x,y,x,y, and r.r.
The trigonometric functions are periodic. The sine, cosine, secant, and cosecant functions have period 2π.2π. The tangent and cotangent functions have period π.π.",,

 Inverse Functions","_list_1
 For a function to have an inverse, the function must be one-to-one. Given the graph of a function, we can determine whether the function is one-to-one by using the horizontal line test.
If a function is not one-to-one, we can restrict the domain to a smaller domain where the function is one-to-one and then define the inverse of the function on the smaller domain.
For a function ff and its inverse f−1,f(f−1(x))=xf−1,f(f−1(x))=x for all xx in the domain of f−1f−1 and f−1(f(x))=xf−1(f(x))=x for all xx in the domain of f.f.
Since the trigonometric functions are periodic, we need to restrict their domains to define the inverse trigonometric functions.
The graph of a function ff and its inverse f−1f−1 are symmetric about the line y=x.y=x.",,

 The exponential function y=bxy=bx is increasing if b>1b>1 and decreasing if 0<b<1.0<b<1. Its domain is (−∞,∞)(−∞,∞) and its range is (0,∞).(0,∞).
The logarithmic function y=logb(x)y=logb(x) is the inverse of y=bx.y=bx. Its domain is (0,∞)(0,∞) and its range is (−∞,∞).(−∞,∞).
The natural exponential function is y=exy=ex and the natural logarithmic function is y=lnx=logex.y=lnx=logex.
Given an exponential function or logarithmic function in base a,a, we can make a change of base to convert this function to any base b>0,b≠1.b>0,b≠1. We typically convert to base e.e.
The hyperbolic functions involve combinations of the exponential functions exex and e−x.e−x. As a result, the inverse hyperbolic functions involve the natural logarithm.",,

The Tangent Problem and Differential Calculus,"_paragraph_1
 Rate of change is one of the most critical concepts in calculus. We begin our investigation of rates of change by looking at the graphs of the three lines f(x)=−2x−3,g(x)=12x+1,f(x)=−2x−3,g(x)=12x+1, and h(x)=2,h(x)=2, shown in Figure 2.2.

 The rate of change of a linear function is constant in each of these three graphs, with the constant determined by the slope.
_paragraph_7
 As we move from left to right along the graph of f(x)=−2x−3,f(x)=−2x−3, we see that the graph decreases at a constant rate. For every 1 unit we move to the right along the x-axis, the y-coordinate decreases by 2 units. This rate of change is determined by the slope (−2) of the line. Similarly, the slope of 1/2 in the function g(x)g(x) tells us that for every change in x of 1 unit there is a corresponding change in y of 1/2 unit. The function h(x)=2h(x)=2 has a slope of zero, indicating that the values of the function remain constant. We see that the slope of each linear function indicates the rate of change of the function.

 Compare the graphs of these three functions with the graph of k(x)=x2k(x)=x2 (Figure 2.3). The graph of k(x)=x2k(x)=x2 starts from the left by decreasing rapidly, then begins to decrease more slowly and level off, and then finally begins to increase—slowly at first, followed by an increasing rate of increase as it moves toward the right. Unlike a linear function, no single number represents the rate of change for this function. We quite naturally ask: How do we measure the rate of change of a nonlinear function?

 We can approximate the rate of change of a function f(x)f(x) at a point (a,f(a))(a,f(a)) on its graph by taking another point (x,f(x))(x,f(x)) on the graph of f(x),f(x), drawing a line through the two points, and calculating the slope of the resulting line. Such a line is called a secant line. Figure 2.4 shows a secant line to a function f(x)f(x) at a point (a,f(a)).(a,f(a)).

 The slope of a secant line through a point (a,f(a))(a,f(a)) estimates the rate of change of the function at the point (a,f(a)).(a,f(a)).

 We formally define a secant line as follows:
_paragraph_30
 Definition
_paragraph_31
 The secant to the function f(x)f(x) through the points (a,f(a))(a,f(a)) and (x,f(x))(x,f(x)) is the line passing through these points. Its slope is given by

_paragraph_36
 The accuracy of approximating the rate of change of the function with a secant line depends on how close x is to a. As we see in Figure 2.5, if x is closer to a, the slope of the secant line is a better measure of the rate of change of f(x)f(x) at a.

 As x gets closer to a, the slope of the secant line becomes a better approximation to the rate of change of the function f(x)f(x) at a.
_paragraph_41
 The secant lines themselves approach a line that is called the tangent to the function f(x)f(x) at a (Figure 2.6). The slope of the tangent line to the graph at a measures the rate of change of the function at a. This value also represents the derivative of the function f(x)f(x) at a, or the rate of change of the function at a. This derivative is denoted by f′(a).f′(a). Differential calculus is the field of calculus concerned with the study of derivatives and their applications.

 We continue our investigation by exploring a related question. Keeping in mind that velocity may be thought of as the rate of change of position, suppose that we have a function, s(t),s(t), that gives the position of an object along a coordinate axis at any given time t. Can we use these same ideas to create a reasonable definition of the instantaneous velocity at a given time t=a?t=a? We start by approximating the instantaneous velocity with an average velocity. First, recall that the speed of an object traveling at a constant rate is the ratio of the distance traveled to the length of time it has traveled. We define the average velocity of an object over a time period to be the change in its position divided by the length of the time period.

 As t is chosen closer to a, the average velocity becomes closer to the instantaneous velocity. Note that finding the average velocity of a position function over a time interval is essentially the same as finding the slope of a secant line to a function. Furthermore, to find the slope of a tangent line at a point a, we let the x-values approach a in the slope of the secant line. Similarly, to find the instantaneous velocity at time a, we let the t-values approach a in the average velocity. This process of letting x or t approach a in an expression is called taking a limit. Thus, we may define the instantaneous velocity as follows.

 Definition
_paragraph_92
 For a position function s(t),s(t), the instantaneous velocity at a time t=at=a is the value that the average velocities approach on intervals of the form [a,t][a,t] and [t,a][t,a] as the values of t become closer to a, provided such a value exists.

The Area Problem and Integral Calculus,"_paragraph_1
 We now turn our attention to a classic question from calculus. Many quantities in physics—for example, quantities of work—may be interpreted as the area under a curve. This leads us to ask the question: How can we find the area between the graph of a function and the x-axis over an interval (Figure 2.8)?

 As in the answer to our previous questions on velocity, we first try to approximate the solution. We approximate the area by dividing up the interval [a,b][a,b] into smaller intervals in the shape of rectangles. The approximation of the area comes from adding up the areas of these rectangles (Figure 2.9).

Other Aspects of Calculus,"_paragraph_1
 So far, we have studied functions of one variable only. Such functions can be represented visually using graphs in two dimensions; however, there is no good reason to restrict our investigation to two dimensions. Suppose, for example, that instead of determining the velocity of an object moving along a coordinate axis, we want to determine the velocity of a rock fired from a catapult at a given time, or of an airplane moving in three dimensions. We might want to graph real-value functions of two variables or determine volumes of solids of the type shown in Figure 2.11. These are only a few of the types of questions that can be asked and answered using multivariable calculus. Informally, multivariable calculus can be characterized as the study of the calculus of functions of two or more variables. However, before exploring these and other ideas, we must first lay a foundation for the study of calculus in one variable by exploring the concept of a limit.

Intuitive Definition of a Limit,"_paragraph_1
 Let’s first take a closer look at how the function f(x)=(x2−4)/(x−2)f(x)=(x2−4)/(x−2) behaves around x=2x=2 in Figure 2.12. As the values of x approach 2 from either side of 2, the values of y=f(x)y=f(x) approach 4. Mathematically, we say that the limit of f(x)f(x) as x approaches 2 is 4. Symbolically, we express this limit as
_paragraph_2
 f(x)=(x2−4)/(x−2)f(x)=(x2−4)/(x−2)
_paragraph_3
 x=2x=2
_paragraph_4
 y=f(x)y=f(x)
_paragraph_5
 f(x)f(x)
_paragraph_6
 From this very brief informal look at one limit, let’s start to develop an intuitive definition of the limit. We can think of the limit of a function at a number a as being the one real number L that the functional values approach as the x-values approach a, provided such a real number L exists. Stated more carefully, we have the following definition:
_paragraph_7
 intuitive definition of the limit
_paragraph_8
 Definition
_paragraph_9
 Let f(x)f(x) be a function defined at all values in an open interval containing a, with the possible exception of a itself, and let L be a real number. If all values of the function f(x)f(x) approach the real number L as the values of x(≠a)x(≠a) approach the number a, then we say that the limit of f(x)f(x) as x approaches a is L. (More succinct, as x gets closer to a, f(x)f(x) gets closer and stays close to L.) Symbolically, we express this idea as
_paragraph_10
 f(x)f(x)

 f(x)f(x)

 After inspecting this table, we see that the functional values less than 4 appear to be decreasing toward 0.25 whereas the functional values greater than 4 appear to be increasing toward 0.25. We conclude that limx→4x−2x−4=0.25.limx→4x−2x−4=0.25. We confirm this estimate using the graph of f(x)=x−2x−4f(x)=x−2x−4 shown in Figure 2.14.

 At this point, we see from Example 2.4 and Example 2.5 that it may be just as easy, if not easier, to estimate a limit of a function by inspecting its graph as it is to estimate the limit by using a table of functional values. In Example 2.6, we evaluate a limit exclusively by looking at a graph rather than by using a table of functional values.

 Despite the fact that g(−1)=4,g(−1)=4, as the x-values approach −1 from either side, the g(x)g(x) values approach 3. Therefore, limx→−1g(x)=3.limx→−1g(x)=3. Note that we can determine this limit without even knowing the algebraic expression of the function.

 Based on Example 2.6, we make the following observation: It is possible for the limit of a function to exist at a point, and for the function to be defined at this point, but the limit of the function and the value of the function at the point may be different.

 Looking at a table of functional values or looking at the graph of a function provides us with useful insight into the value of the limit of a function at a given point. However, these techniques rely too much on guesswork. We eventually need to develop alternative methods of evaluating limits. These new methods are more algebraic in nature and we explore them in the next section; however, at this point we introduce two special limits that are foundational to the techniques to come.

The Existence of a Limit,"_paragraph_1
 As we consider the limit in the next example, keep in mind that for the limit of a function to exist at a point, the functional values must approach a single real-number value at that point. If the functional values do not approach a single value, then the limit does not exist.

 After examining the table of functional values, we can see that the y-values do not seem to approach any one single value. It appears the limit does not exist. Before drawing this conclusion, let’s take a more systematic approach. Take the following sequence of x-values approaching 0:

 The corresponding y-values are
_paragraph_14
 At this point we can indeed conclude that limx→0sin(1/x)limx→0sin(1/x) does not exist. (Mathematicians frequently abbreviate “does not exist” as DNE. Thus, we would write limx→0sin(1/x)limx→0sin(1/x) DNE.) The graph of f(x)=sin(1/x)f(x)=sin(1/x) is shown in Figure 2.17 and it gives a clearer picture of the behavior of sin(1/x)sin(1/x) as x approaches 0. You can see that sin(1/x)sin(1/x) oscillates ever more wildly between −1 and 1 as x approaches 0.

One-Sided Limits,"_paragraph_1
 Sometimes indicating that the limit of a function fails to exist at a point does not provide us with enough information about the behavior of the function at that particular point. To see this, we now revisit the function g(x)=|x−2|/(x−2)g(x)=|x−2|/(x−2) introduced at the beginning of the section (see Figure 2.12(b)). As we pick values of x close to 2, g(x)g(x) does not approach a single value, so the limit as x approaches 2 does not exist—that is, limx→2g(x)limx→2g(x) DNE. However, this statement alone does not give us a complete picture of the behavior of the function around the x-value 2. To provide a more accurate description, we introduce the idea of a one-sided limit. For all values to the left of 2 (or the negative side of 2), g(x)=−1.g(x)=−1. Thus, as x approaches 2 from the left, g(x)g(x) approaches −1. Mathematically, we say that the limit as x approaches 2 from the left is −1. Symbolically, we express this idea as
_paragraph_2
 g(x)=|x−2|/(x−2)g(x)=|x−2|/(x−2)

 Similarly, as x approaches 2 from the right (or from the positive side), g(x)g(x) approaches 1. Symbolically, we express this idea as

 We can now present an informal definition of one-sided limits.

If the values of the function f(x)f(x) approach the real number L as the values of x (where x<a)x<a) approach the number a, then we say that L is the limit of f(x)f(x) as x approaches a from the left.

 Let us now consider the relationship between the limit of a function at a point and the limits from the right and left at that point. It seems clear that if the limit from the right and the limit from the left have a common value, then that common value is the limit of the function at that point. Similarly, if the limit from the left and the limit from the right take on different values, the limit of the function does not exist.

Infinite Limits,"_paragraph_1
 Evaluating the limit of a function at a point or evaluating the limit of a function from the right and left at a point helps us to characterize the behavior of a function around a given value. As we shall see, we can also describe the behavior of functions that do not have finite limits.

 We now turn our attention to h(x)=1/(x−2)2,h(x)=1/(x−2)2, the third and final function introduced at the beginning of this section (see Figure 2.12(c)). From its graph we see that as the values of x approach 2, the values of h(x)=1/(x−2)2h(x)=1/(x−2)2 become larger and larger and, in fact, become infinite. Mathematically, we say that the limit of h(x)h(x) as x approaches 2 is positive infinity. Symbolically, we express this idea as
_paragraph_3
 h(x)=1/(x−2)2,h(x)=1/(x−2)2,

We are not asserting that a limit exists. For the limit of a function f(x)f(x) to exist at a, it must approach a real number L as x approaches a. That said, if, for example, limx→af(x)=+∞,limx→af(x)=+∞, we always write limx→af(x)=+∞limx→af(x)=+∞ rather than limx→af(x)limx→af(x) DNE.

That is, as x approaches a, the points on the graph of f(x)f(x) are closer to the line x=a.x=a. The line x=ax=a is called a vertical asymptote of the graph.

 In the chapter opener we mentioned briefly how Albert Einstein showed that a limit exists to how fast any object can travel. Given Einstein’s equation for the mass of a moving object, what is the value of this bound?
_paragraph_107
 Solution
_paragraph_108
 Our starting point is Einstein’s equation for the mass of a moving object,
_paragraph_109
 where m0m0 is the object’s mass at rest, v is its speed, and c is the speed of light. To see how the mass changes at high speeds, we can graph the ratio of masses m/m0m/m0 as a function of the ratio of speeds, v/cv/c (Figure 2.23).

_paragraph_115
 This graph shows the ratio of masses as a function of the ratio of speeds in Einstein’s equation for the mass of a moving object.
_paragraph_116
 We can see that as the ratio of speeds approaches 1—that is, as the speed of the object approaches the speed of light—the ratio of masses increases without bound. In other words, the function has a vertical asymptote at v/c=1.v/c=1. We can try a few values of this ratio to test this idea.

 v/c=1.v/c=1.

 Thus, according to Table 2.8, if an object with mass 100 kg is traveling at 0.9999c, its mass becomes 7071 kg. Since no object can have an infinite mass, we conclude that no object can travel at or more than the speed of light.",,"_table_1

This is not always true, but it does hold for all polynomials for any choice of a and for all rational functions at all values of a for which the rational function is defined.

 Let p(x)p(x) and q(x)q(x) be polynomial functions. Let a be a real number. Then,
_paragraph_7

_paragraph_9
 To see that this theorem holds, consider the polynomial p(x)=cnxn+cn−1xn−1+⋯+c1x+c0.p(x)=cnxn+cn−1xn−1+⋯+c1x+c0. By applying the sum, constant multiple, and power laws, we end up with
_paragraph_10
 p(x)=cnxn+cn−1xn−1+⋯+c1x+c0.p(x)=cnxn+cn−1xn−1+⋯+c1x+c0.
_paragraph_11
 It now follows from the quotient law that if p(x)p(x) and q(x)q(x) are polynomials for which q(a)≠0,q(a)≠0, then

 Since 3 is in the domain of the rational function f(x)=2x2−3x+15x+4,f(x)=2x2−3x+15x+4, we can calculate the limit by substituting 3 for x into the function. Thus,

Additional Limit Evaluation Techniques,"_paragraph_1
 As we have seen, we may evaluate easily the limits of polynomials and limits of some (but not all) rational functions by direct substitution. However, as we saw in the introductory section on limits, it is certainly possible for limx→af(x)limx→af(x) to exist when f(a)f(a) is undefined. The following observation allows us to evaluate many limits of this type:
_paragraph_2
 limx→af(x)limx→af(x)
_paragraph_3
 f(a)f(a)
_paragraph_4
 If for all x≠a,f(x)=g(x)x≠a,f(x)=g(x) over some open interval containing a, then limx→af(x)=limx→ag(x).limx→af(x)=limx→ag(x).
_paragraph_5
 x≠a,f(x)=g(x)x≠a,f(x)=g(x)
_paragraph_6
 limx→af(x)=limx→ag(x).limx→af(x)=limx→ag(x).
_paragraph_7
 To understand this idea better, consider the limit limx→1x2−1x−1.limx→1x2−1x−1.
_paragraph_8
 limx→1x2−1x−1.limx→1x2−1x−1.

 The limit has the form limx→af(x)g(x),limx→af(x)g(x), where limx→af(x)=0limx→af(x)=0 and limx→ag(x)=0.limx→ag(x)=0. (In this case, we say that f(x)/g(x)f(x)/g(x) has the indeterminate form 0/0.)0/0.) The following Problem-Solving Strategy provides a general outline for evaluating limits of this type.

_paragraph_30
 Solution
_paragraph_31
 Step 1. The function f(x)=x2−3x2x2−5x−3f(x)=x2−3x2x2−5x−3 is undefined for x=3.x=3. In fact, if we substitute 3 into the function we get 0/0,0/0, which is undefined. Factoring and canceling is a good strategy:
_paragraph_32
 f(x)=x2−3x2x2−5x−3f(x)=x2−3x2x2−5x−3

_paragraph_46
 Solution
_paragraph_47
 Step 1. x+2−1x+1x+2−1x+1 has the form 0/00/0 at −1. Let’s begin by multiplying by x+2+1,x+2+1, the conjugate of x+2−1,x+2−1, on the numerator and denominator:

 x+2−1x+1x+2−1x+1

_paragraph_50
 x+2+1,x+2+1,
_paragraph_51
 x+2−1,x+2−1,
_paragraph_52
 Step 2. We then multiply out the numerator. We don’t multiply out the denominator because we are hoping that the (x+1)(x+1) in the denominator cancels out in the end:
_paragraph_53
 (x+1)(x+1)
_paragraph_54
 Step 3. Then we cancel:

_paragraph_64
 Solution
_paragraph_65
 Step 1. 1x+1−12x−11x+1−12x−1 has the form 0/00/0 at 1. We simplify the algebraic fraction by multiplying by 2(x+1)/2(x+1):2(x+1)/2(x+1):

_paragraph_67
 0/00/0
_paragraph_68
 2(x+1)/2(x+1):2(x+1)/2(x+1):
_paragraph_69
 Step 2. Next, we multiply through the numerators. Do not multiply the denominators because we want to be able to cancel the factor (x−1):(x−1):
_paragraph_70
 (x−1):(x−1):
_paragraph_71
 Step 3. Then, we simplify the numerator:
_paragraph_72
 Step 4. Now we factor out −1 from the numerator:
_paragraph_73
 Step 5. Then, we cancel the common factors of (x−1):(x−1):

 (x−1):(x−1):

 Both 1/x1/x and 5/x(x−5)5/x(x−5) fail to have a limit at zero. Since neither of the two functions has a limit at zero, we cannot apply the sum law for limits; we must use a different strategy. In this case, we find the limit by performing addition and then applying one of our previous strategies. Observe that

 Let’s now revisit one-sided limits. Simple modifications in the limit laws allow us to apply them to one-sided limits. For example, to apply the limit laws to a limit of the form limx→a−h(x),limx→a−h(x), we require the function h(x)h(x) to be defined over an open interval of the form (b,a);(b,a); for a limit of the form limx→a+h(x),limx→a+h(x), we require the function h(x)h(x) to be defined over an open interval of the form (a,c).(a,c).

 Solution
_paragraph_138
 Step 1. After substituting in x=2,x=2, we see that this limit has the form −1/0.−1/0. That is, as x approaches 2 from the left, the numerator approaches −1; and the denominator approaches 0. Consequently, the magnitude of x−3x(x−2)x−3x(x−2) becomes infinite. To get a better idea of what the limit is, we need to factor the denominator:
_paragraph_139
 x=2,x=2,
_paragraph_140
 −1/0.−1/0.
_paragraph_141
 x−3x(x−2)x−3x(x−2)
_paragraph_142
 Step 2. Since x−2x−2 is the only part of the denominator that is zero when 2 is substituted, we then separate 1/(x−2)1/(x−2) from the rest of the function:

 x−2x−2

The Squeeze Theorem,"_paragraph_1
 The techniques we have developed thus far work very well for algebraic functions, but we are still unable to evaluate limits of very basic trigonometric functions. The next theorem, called the squeeze theorem, proves very useful for establishing basic trigonometric limits. This theorem allows us to calculate limits by “squeezing” a function, with a limit at a point a that is unknown, between two functions having a common known limit at a. Figure 2.27 illustrates this idea.

 We now use the squeeze theorem to tackle several very important limits. Although this discussion is somewhat lengthy, these limits prove invaluable for the development of the material in both the next section and the next chapter. The first of these limits is limθ→0sinθ.limθ→0sinθ. Consider the unit circle shown in Figure 2.29. In the figure, we see that sinθsinθ is the y-coordinate on the unit circle and it corresponds to the line segment shown in blue. The radian measure of angle θ is the length of the arc it subtends on the unit circle. Therefore, we see that for 0<θ<π2,0<sinθ<θ.0<θ<π2,0<sinθ<θ.

 The sine function is shown as a line on the unit circle.
_paragraph_43
 Because limθ→0+0=0limθ→0+0=0 and limθ→0+θ=0,limθ→0+θ=0, by using the squeeze theorem we conclude that
_paragraph_44
 limθ→0+0=0limθ→0+0=0
_paragraph_45
 limθ→0+θ=0,limθ→0+θ=0,
_paragraph_46
 To see that limθ→0−sinθ=0limθ→0−sinθ=0 as well, observe that for −π2<θ<0,0<−θ<π2−π2<θ<0,0<−θ<π2 and hence, 0<sin(−θ)<−θ.0<sin(−θ)<−θ. Consequently, 0<−sinθ<−θ.0<−sinθ<−θ. It follows that 0>sinθ>θ.0>sinθ>θ. An application of the squeeze theorem produces the desired limit. Thus, since limθ→0+sinθ=0limθ→0+sinθ=0 and limθ→0−sinθ=0,limθ→0−sinθ=0,

 We now take a look at a limit that plays an important role in later chapters—namely, limθ→0sinθθ.limθ→0sinθθ. To evaluate this limit, we use the unit circle in Figure 2.30. Notice that this figure adds one additional triangle to Figure 2.30. We see that the length of the side opposite angle θ in this new triangle is tanθ.tanθ. Thus, we see that for 0<θ<π2,sinθ<θ<tanθ.0<θ<π2,sinθ<θ<tanθ.

 Equivalently, we have
_paragraph_69
 Since limθ→0+1=1=limθ→0+cosθ,limθ→0+1=1=limθ→0+cosθ, we conclude that limθ→0+sinθθ=1.limθ→0+sinθθ=1. By applying a manipulation similar to that used in demonstrating that limθ→0−sinθ=0,limθ→0−sinθ=0, we can show that limθ→0−sinθθ=1.limθ→0−sinθθ=1. Thus,
_paragraph_70
 limθ→0+1=1=limθ→0+cosθ,limθ→0+1=1=limθ→0+cosθ,

 limθ→0+sinθθ=1.limθ→0+sinθθ=1.

 limθ→0−sinθθ=1.limθ→0−sinθθ=1.
_paragraph_74
 (2.18)
_paragraph_75
 In Example 2.25 we use this limit to establish limθ→01−cosθθ=0.limθ→01−cosθθ=0. This limit also proves useful in later chapters.

 limθ→01−cosθθ=0.limθ→01−cosθθ=0.

 Solution
_paragraph_82
 In the first step, we multiply by the conjugate so that we can use a trigonometric identity to convert the cosine in the numerator to a sine:

 Deriving the Formula for the Area of a Circle
_paragraph_91
 Some of the geometric formulas we take for granted today were first derived by methods that anticipate some of the methods of calculus. The Greek mathematician Archimedes (ca. 287−212; BCE) was particularly inventive, using polygons inscribed within circles to approximate the area of the circle as the number of sides of the polygon increased. He never came up with the idea of a limit, but we can use this idea to see what his geometric constructions could have predicted about the limit.
_paragraph_92
 Archimedes
_paragraph_93
 We can estimate the area of a circle by computing the area of an inscribed regular polygon. Think of the regular polygon as being made up of n triangles. By taking the limit as the vertex angle of these triangles goes to zero, you can obtain the area of the circle. To see this, carry out the following steps:

Continuity at a Point,"_paragraph_1
 Before we look at a formal definition of what it means for a function to be continuous at a point, let’s consider various functions that fail to meet our intuitive notion of what it means to be continuous at a point. We then create a list of conditions that prevent such failures.
_paragraph_2
 Our first function of interest is shown in Figure 2.32. We see that the graph of f(x)f(x) has a hole at a. In fact, f(a)f(a) is undefined. At the very least, for f(x)f(x) to be continuous at a, we need the following condition:
_paragraph_3
 f(x)f(x)
_paragraph_4
 f(a)f(a)
_paragraph_5
 f(x)f(x)
_paragraph_6
 Figure
_paragraph_7
 2.32
_paragraph_8
 The function f(x)f(x) is not continuous at a because f(a)f(a) is undefined.
_paragraph_9
 However, as we see in Figure 2.33, this condition alone is insufficient to guarantee continuity at the point a. Although f(a)f(a) is defined, the function has a gap at a. In this example, the gap exists because limx→af(x)limx→af(x) does not exist. We must add another condition for continuity at a—namely,
_paragraph_10
 f(a)f(a)
_paragraph_11
 limx→af(x)limx→af(x)
_paragraph_12
 Figure
_paragraph_13
 2.33
_paragraph_14
 The function f(x)f(x) is not continuous at a because limx→af(x)limx→af(x) does not exist.
_paragraph_15
 However, as we see in Figure 2.34, these two conditions by themselves do not guarantee continuity at a point. The function in this figure satisfies both of our first two conditions, but is still not continuous at a. We must add a third condition to our list:
_paragraph_16
 Figure
_paragraph_17
 2.34
_paragraph_18
 The function f(x)f(x) is not continuous at a because limx→af(x)≠f(a).limx→af(x)≠f(a).
_paragraph_19
 Now we put our list of conditions together and form a definition of continuity at a point.
_paragraph_20
 Definition
_paragraph_21
 A function f(x)f(x) is continuous at a point a if and only if the following three conditions are satisfied:
_paragraph_22
 f(x)f(x)
_paragraph_23
 continuous at a point
_paragraph_24
 A function is discontinuous at a point a if it fails to be continuous at a.
_paragraph_25
 discontinuous at a point
_paragraph_26
 The following procedure can be used to analyze the continuity of a function at a point using this definition.
_paragraph_27

_paragraph_28
 Problem-Solving Strategy: Determining Continuity at a Point
_paragraph_29
 The next three examples demonstrate how to apply this definition to determine whether a function is continuous at a given point. These examples illustrate situations in which each of the conditions for continuity in the definition succeed or fail.
_paragraph_30
 Example
_paragraph_31

_paragraph_32
 Using the definition, determine whether the function f(x)=(x2−4)/(x−2)f(x)=(x2−4)/(x−2) is continuous at x=2.x=2. Justify the conclusion.
_paragraph_33
 f(x)=(x2−4)/(x−2)f(x)=(x2−4)/(x−2)
_paragraph_34
 x=2.x=2.
_paragraph_35
 Solution
_paragraph_36
 Let’s begin by trying to calculate f(2).f(2). We can see that f(2)=0/0,f(2)=0/0, which is undefined. Therefore, f(x)=x2−4x−2f(x)=x2−4x−2 is discontinuous at 2 because f(2)f(2) is undefined. The graph of f(x)f(x) is shown in Figure 2.35.
_paragraph_37

 Solution
_paragraph_51
 Let’s begin by trying to calculate f(3).f(3).
_paragraph_52
 f(3).f(3).
_paragraph_53
 Thus, f(3)f(3) is defined. Next, we calculate limx→3f(x).limx→3f(x). To do this, we must compute limx→3−f(x)limx→3−f(x) and limx→3+f(x):limx→3+f(x):
_paragraph_54
 f(3)f(3)
_paragraph_55
 limx→3f(x).limx→3f(x).
_paragraph_56
 limx→3−f(x)limx→3−f(x)
_paragraph_57
 limx→3+f(x):limx→3+f(x):
_paragraph_58
 and
_paragraph_59
 Therefore, limx→3f(x)limx→3f(x) does not exist. Thus, f(x)f(x) is not continuous at 3. The graph of f(x)f(x) is shown in Figure 2.36.

 Using the definition, determine whether the function f(x)={sinxxifx≠01ifx=0f(x)={sinxxifx≠01ifx=0 is continuous at x=0.x=0.
_paragraph_69
 f(x)={sinxxifx≠01ifx=0f(x)={sinxxifx≠01ifx=0
_paragraph_70
 x=0.x=0.
_paragraph_71
 Solution
_paragraph_72
 First, observe that
_paragraph_73
 Next,
_paragraph_74
 Last, compare f(0)f(0) and limx→1f(x).limx→1f(x). We see that
_paragraph_75
 f(0)f(0)
_paragraph_76
 limx→1f(x).limx→1f(x).
_paragraph_77
 Since all three of the conditions in the definition of continuity are satisfied, f(x)f(x) is continuous at x=0.x=0.
_paragraph_78
 f(x)f(x)
_paragraph_79
 x=0.x=0.

 Using the definition, determine whether the function f(x)={2x+1ifx<12ifx=1−x+4ifx>1f(x)={2x+1ifx<12ifx=1−x+4ifx>1 is continuous at x=1.x=1. If the function is not continuous at 1, indicate the condition for continuity at a point that fails to hold.

 By applying the definition of continuity and previously established theorems concerning the evaluation of limits, we can state the following theorem.

Types of Discontinuities,"_paragraph_1
 As we have seen in Example 2.26 and Example 2.27, discontinuities take on several different appearances. We classify the types of discontinuities we have seen thus far as removable discontinuities, infinite discontinuities, or jump discontinuities. Intuitively, a removable discontinuity is a discontinuity for which there is a hole in the graph, a jump discontinuity is a noninfinite discontinuity for which the sections of the function do not meet up, and an infinite discontinuity is a discontinuity located at a vertical asymptote. Figure 2.37 illustrates the differences in these types of discontinuities. Although these terms provide a handy way of describing three common types of discontinuities, keep in mind that not all discontinuities fit neatly into these categories.

 The function value f(−1)f(−1) is undefined. Therefore, the function is not continuous at −1. To determine the type of discontinuity, we must determine the limit at −1. We see that limx→−1−x+2x+1=−∞limx→−1−x+2x+1=−∞ and limx→−1+x+2x+1=+∞.limx→−1+x+2x+1=+∞. Therefore, the function has an infinite discontinuity at −1.

Continuity over an Interval,"_paragraph_1
 Now that we have explored the concept of continuity at a point, we extend that idea to continuity over an interval. As we develop this idea for different types of intervals, it may be useful to keep in mind the intuitive idea that a function is continuous over an interval if we can use a pencil to trace the function between any two points in the interval without lifting the pencil from the paper. In preparation for defining continuity on an interval, we begin by looking at the definition of what it means for a function to be continuous from the right at a point and continuous from the left at a point.

 A function is continuous over an open interval if it is continuous at every point in the interval. A function f(x)f(x) is continuous over a closed interval of the form [a,b][a,b] if it is continuous at every point in (a,b)(a,b) and is continuous from the right at a and is continuous from the left at b. Analogously, a function f(x)f(x) is continuous over an interval of the form (a,b](a,b] if it is continuous over (a,b)(a,b) and is continuous from the left at b. Continuity over other types of intervals are defined in a similar fashion.

 Requiring that limx→a+f(x)=f(a)limx→a+f(x)=f(a) and limx→b−f(x)=f(b)limx→b−f(x)=f(b) ensures that we can trace the graph of the function from the point (a,f(a))(a,f(a)) to the point (b,f(b))(b,f(b)) without lifting the pencil. If, for example, limx→a+f(x)≠f(a),limx→a+f(x)≠f(a), we would need to lift our pencil to jump from f(a)f(a) to the graph of the rest of the function over (a,b].(a,b].

_paragraph_2
 |a−b|.|a−b|.
_paragraph_3
 It is also important to look at the following equivalences for absolute value:

 This definition may seem rather complex from a mathematical point of view, but it becomes easier to understand if we break it down phrase by phrase. The statement itself involves something called a universal quantifier (for every ε>0),ε>0), an existential quantifier (there exists a δ>0),δ>0), and, last, a conditional statement (if 0<|x−a|<δ,0<|x−a|<δ, then |f(x)−L|<ε).|f(x)−L|<ε). Let’s take a look at Table 2.9, which breaks down the definition and translates each part.

 We can get a better handle on this definition by looking at the definition geometrically. Figure 2.39 shows possible values of δδ for various choices of ε>0ε>0 for a given function f(x),f(x), a number a, and a limit L at a. Notice that as we choose smaller values of ε (the distance between the function and the limit), we can always find a δδ small enough so that if we have chosen an x value within δδ of a, then the value of f(x)f(x) is within ε of the limit L.

 The definition continues with “there exists a δ>0.δ>0.” The phrase “there exists” in a mathematical statement is always a signal for a scavenger hunt. In other words, we must go and find δ.δ. So, where exactly did δ=ε/2δ=ε/2 come from? There are two basic approaches to tracking down δ.δ. One method is purely algebraic and the other is geometric.

 We begin by tackling the problem from an algebraic point of view. Since ultimately we want |(2x+1)−3|<ε,|(2x+1)−3|<ε, we begin by manipulating this expression: |(2x+1)−3|<ε|(2x+1)−3|<ε is equivalent to |2x−2|<ε,|2x−2|<ε, which in turn is equivalent to |2||x−1|<ε.|2||x−1|<ε. Last, this is equivalent to |x−1|<ε/2.|x−1|<ε/2. Thus, it would seem that δ=ε/2δ=ε/2 is appropriate.

 In this part of the proof, we started with |(2x+1)−3||(2x+1)−3| and used our assumption 0<|x−1|<δ0<|x−1|<δ in a key part of the chain of inequalities to get |(2x+1)−3||(2x+1)−3| to be less than ε. We could just as easily have manipulated the assumed inequality 0<|x−1|<δ0<|x−1|<δ to arrive at |(2x+1)−3|<ε|(2x+1)−3|<ε as follows:

 |(2x+1)−3||(2x+1)−3|

 Therefore, limx→1(2x+1)=3.limx→1(2x+1)=3. (Having completed the proof, we state what we have accomplished.)
_paragraph_87
 limx→1(2x+1)=3.limx→1(2x+1)=3.

 After removing all the remarks, here is a final version of the proof:

 The geometric approach to proving that the limit of a function takes on a specific value works quite well for some functions. Also, the insight into the formal definition of the limit that this method provides is invaluable. However, we may also approach limit proofs from a purely algebraic point of view. In many cases, an algebraic approach may not only provide us with additional insight into the definition, it may prove to be simpler as well. Furthermore, an algebraic approach is the primary tool used in proofs of statements about limits. For Example 2.42, we take on a purely algebraic approach.

Proving Limit Laws,"_paragraph_1
 We now demonstrate how to use the epsilon-delta definition of a limit to construct a rigorous proof of one of the limit laws. The triangle inequality is used at a key point of the proof, so we first review this key property of absolute value.

 The triangle inequality states that if a and b are any real numbers, then |a+b|≤|a|+|b|.|a+b|≤|a|+|b|.

 |a+b|≤|a|+|b|.|a+b|≤|a|+|b|.

 We prove the following limit law: If limx→af(x)=Llimx→af(x)=L and limx→ag(x)=M,limx→ag(x)=M, then limx→a(f(x)+g(x))=L+M.limx→a(f(x)+g(x))=L+M.

One-Sided and Infinite Limits,"_paragraph_1
 Just as we first gained an intuitive understanding of limits and then moved on to a more rigorous definition of a limit, we now revisit one-sided limits. To do this, we modify the epsilon-delta definition of a limit to give formal epsilon-delta definitions for limits from the right and left at a point. These definitions only require slight modifications from the definition of the limit. In the definition of the limit from the right, the inequality 0<x−a<δ0<x−a<δ replaces 0<|x−a|<δ,0<|x−a|<δ, which ensures that we only consider values of x that are greater than (to the right of) a. Similarly, in the definition of the limit from the left, the inequality −δ<x−a<0−δ<x−a<0 replaces 0<|x−a|<δ,0<|x−a|<δ, which ensures that we only consider values of x that are less than (to the left of) a.

 We conclude the process of converting our intuitive ideas of various types of limits to rigorous formal definitions by pursuing a formal definition of infinite limits. To have limx→af(x)=+∞,limx→af(x)=+∞, we want the values of the function f(x)f(x) to get larger and larger as x approaches a. Instead of the requirement that |f(x)−L|<ε|f(x)−L|<ε for arbitrarily small ε when 0<|x−a|<δ0<|x−a|<δ for small enough δ,δ, we want f(x)>Mf(x)>M for arbitrarily large positive M when 0<|x−a|<δ0<|x−a|<δ for small enough δ.δ. Figure 2.43 illustrates this idea by showing the value of δδ for successively larger values of M.

_paragraph_2
 A Preview of Calculus","_list_1
 Differential calculus arose from trying to solve the problem of determining the slope of a line tangent to a curve at a point. The slope of the tangent line indicates the rate of change of the function, also called the derivative. Calculating a derivative requires finding a limit.
Integral calculus arose from trying to solve the problem of finding the area of a region between the graph of a function and the x-axis. We can approximate the area by dividing it into thin rectangles and summing the areas of these rectangles. This summation leads to the value of a function called the integral. The integral is also calculated by finding a limit and, in fact, is related to the derivative of a function.
Multivariable calculus enables us to solve problems in three-dimensional space, including determining motion in space and finding volumes of solids.",,

 The Limit of a Function","_list_1
 A table of values or graph may be used to estimate a limit.
If the limit of a function at a point does not exist, it is still possible that the limits from the left and right at that point may exist.
If the limits of a function from the left and right exist and are equal, then the limit of the function is that common value.
We may use limits to describe infinite behavior of a function at a point.",,

 The Limit Laws","_list_1
 The limit laws allow us to evaluate limits of functions without having to go through step-by-step processes each time.
For polynomials and rational functions, limx→af(x)=f(a).limx→af(x)=f(a).
You can evaluate the limit of a function by factoring and canceling, by multiplying by a conjugate, or by simplifying a complex fraction.
The squeeze theorem allows you to find the limit of a function if the function is always greater than one function and less than another function with limits that are known.",,

_paragraph_2
 Continuity","_list_1
 For a function to be continuous at a point, it must be defined at that point, its limit must exist at the point, and the value of the function at that point must equal the value of the limit at that point.
Discontinuities may be classified as removable, jump, or infinite.
A function is continuous over an open interval if it is continuous at every point in the interval. It is continuous over a closed interval if it is continuous at every point in its interior and is continuous at its endpoints.
The composite function theorem states: If f(x)f(x) is continuous at L and limx→ag(x)=L,limx→ag(x)=L, then limx→af(g(x))=f(limx→ag(x))=f(L).limx→af(g(x))=f(limx→ag(x))=f(L).
The Intermediate Value Theorem guarantees that if a function is continuous over a closed interval, then the function takes on every value between the values at its endpoints.",,

Tangent Lines,"_paragraph_1
 We begin our study of calculus by revisiting the notion of secant lines and tangent lines. Recall that we used the slope of a secant line to a function at a point (a,f(a))(a,f(a)) to estimate the rate of change, or the rate at which one variable changes in relation to another variable. We can obtain the slope of the secant by choosing a value of xx near aa and drawing a line through the points (a,f(a))(a,f(a)) and (x,f(x)),(x,f(x)), as shown in Figure 3.3. The slope of this line is given by an equation in the form of a difference quotient:
_paragraph_2
 (a,f(a))(a,f(a))
_paragraph_3
 xx
_paragraph_4
 aa
_paragraph_5
 (a,f(a))(a,f(a))
_paragraph_6
 (x,f(x)),(x,f(x)),
_paragraph_7
 We can also calculate the slope of a secant line to a function at a value a by using this equation and replacing xx with a+h,a+h, where hh is a value close to 0. We can then calculate the slope of the line through the points (a,f(a))(a,f(a)) and (a+h,f(a+h)).(a+h,f(a+h)). In this case, we find the secant line has a slope given by the following difference quotient with increment h:h:

 These two expressions for calculating the slope of a secant line are illustrated in Figure 3.3. We will see that each of these two methods for finding the slope of a secant line is of value. Depending on the setting, we can choose one or the other. The primary consideration in our choice usually depends on ease of calculation.

 We can calculate the slope of a secant line in either of two ways.
_paragraph_37
 In Figure 3.4(a) we see that, as the values of xx approach a,a, the slopes of the secant lines provide better estimates of the rate of change of the function at a.a. Furthermore, the secant lines themselves approach the tangent line to the function at a,a, which represents the limit of the secant lines. Similarly, Figure 3.4(b) shows that as the values of hh get closer to 0,0, the secant lines also approach the tangent line. The slope of the tangent line at aa is the rate of change of the function at a,a, as shown in Figure 3.4(c).

 In Figure 3.5 we show the graph of f(x)=xf(x)=x and its tangent line at (1,1)(1,1) in a series of tighter intervals about x=1.x=1. As the intervals become narrower, the graph of the function and its tangent line appear to coincide, making the values on the tangent line a good approximation to the values of the function for choices of xx close to 1.1. In fact, the graph of f(x)f(x) itself appears to be locally linear in the immediate vicinity of x=1.x=1.

 Just as we have used two different expressions to define the slope of a secant line, we use two different forms to define the slope of the tangent line. In this text we use both forms of the definition. As before, the choice of definition will depend on the setting. Now that we have formally defined a tangent line to a function at a point, we can use this definition to find equations of tangent lines.

_paragraph_84

_paragraph_85
 First find the slope of the tangent line. In this example, use Equation 3.3.
_paragraph_86
 Next, find a point on the tangent line. Since the line is tangent to the graph of f(x)f(x) at x=3,x=3, it passes through the point (3,f(3)).(3,f(3)). We have f(3)=9,f(3)=9, so the tangent line passes through the point (3,9).(3,9).

 We can use Equation 3.3, but as we have seen, the results are the same if we use Equation 3.4.

 We now know that the slope of the tangent line is −14.−14. To find the equation of the tangent line, we also need a point on the line. We know that f(2)=12.f(2)=12. Since the tangent line passes through the point (2,12)(2,12) we can use the point-slope equation of a line to find the equation of the tangent line. Thus the tangent line has the equation y=−14x+1.y=−14x+1. The graphs of f(x)=1xf(x)=1x and y=−14x+1y=−14x+1 are shown in Figure 3.7.

The Derivative of a Function at a Point,"_paragraph_1
 The type of limit we compute in order to find the slope of the line tangent to a function at a point occurs in many applications across many disciplines. These applications include velocity and acceleration in physics, marginal profit functions in business, and growth rates in biology. This limit occurs so frequently that we give this value a special name: the derivative. The process of finding a derivative is called differentiation.

Velocities and Rates of Change,"_paragraph_1
 Now that we can evaluate a derivative, we can use it in velocity applications. Recall that if s(t)s(t) is the position of an object moving along a coordinate axis, the average velocity of the object over a time interval [a,t][a,t] if t>at>a or [t,a][t,a] if t<at<a is given by the difference quotient

 To better understand the relationship between average velocity and instantaneous velocity, see Figure 3.8. In this figure, the slope of the tangent line (shown in red) is the instantaneous velocity of the object at time t=at=a whose position at time tt is given by the function s(t).s(t). The slope of the secant line (shown in green) is the average velocity of the object over the time interval [a,t].[a,t].

 The slope of the secant line is the average velocity over the interval [a,t].[a,t]. The slope of the tangent line is the instantaneous velocity.

 We can use Equation 3.5 to calculate the instantaneous velocity, or we can estimate the velocity of a moving object by using a table of values. We can then confirm the estimate by using Equation 3.7.

 As we have seen throughout this section, the slope of a tangent line to a function and instantaneous velocity are related concepts.

 We use a variety of different notations to express the derivative of a function. In Example 3.12 we showed that if f(x)=x2−2x,f(x)=x2−2x, then f′(x)=2x−2.f′(x)=2x−2. If we had expressed this function in the form y=x2−2x,y=x2−2x, we could have expressed the derivative as y′=2x−2y′=2x−2 or dydx=2x−2.dydx=2x−2. We could have conveyed the same information by writing ddx(x2−2x)=2x−2.ddx(x2−2x)=2x−2. Thus, for the function y=f(x),y=f(x), each of the following notations represents the derivative of f(x):f(x):
_paragraph_37
 f(x)=x2−2x,f(x)=x2−2x,
_paragraph_38
 f′(x)=2x−2.f′(x)=2x−2.

_paragraph_45
 In place of f′(a)f′(a) we may also use dydx|x=adydx|x=a Use of the dydxdydx notation (called Leibniz notation) is quite common in engineering and physics. To understand this notation better, recall that the derivative of a function at a point is the limit of the slopes of secant lines as the secant lines approach the tangent line. The slopes of these secant lines are often expressed in the form ΔyΔxΔyΔx where ΔyΔy is the difference in the yy values corresponding to the difference in the xx values, which are expressed as ΔxΔx (Figure 3.11). Thus the derivative, which can be thought of as the instantaneous rate of change of yy with respect to x,x, is expressed as

Graphing a Derivative,"_paragraph_1
 We have already discussed how to graph a function, so given the equation of a function or the equation of a derivative function, we could graph it. Given both, we would expect to see a correspondence between the graphs of these two functions, since f′(x)f′(x) gives the rate of change of a function f(x)f(x) (or slope of the tangent line to f(x)).f(x)).

 In Example 3.11 we found that for f(x)=x,f′(x)=1/2x.f(x)=x,f′(x)=1/2x. If we graph these functions on the same axes, as in Figure 3.12, we can use the graphs to understand the relationship between these two functions. First, we notice that f(x)f(x) is increasing over its entire domain, which means that the slopes of its tangent lines at all points are positive. Consequently, we expect f′(x)>0f′(x)>0 for all values of xx in its domain. Furthermore, as xx increases, the slopes of the tangent lines to f(x)f(x) are decreasing and we expect to see a corresponding decrease in f′(x).f′(x). We also observe that f′(0)f′(0) is undefined and that limx→0+f′(x)=+∞,limx→0+f′(x)=+∞, corresponding to a vertical tangent to f(x)f(x) at 0.0.

Derivatives and Continuity,"_paragraph_1
 Now that we can graph a derivative, let’s examine the behavior of the graphs. First, we consider the relationship between differentiability and continuity. We will see that if a function is differentiable at a point, it must be continuous there; however, a function that is continuous at a point need not be differentiable at that point. In fact, a function may be continuous at a point and fail to be differentiable at the point for one of several reasons.

_paragraph_4
 Differentiability Implies Continuity

 Let f(x)f(x) be a function and aa be in its domain. If f(x)f(x) is differentiable at a,a, then ff is continuous at a.a.

 We want to show that f(x)f(x) is continuous at aa by showing that limx→af(x)=f(a).limx→af(x)=f(a). Thus,
_paragraph_17
 f(x)f(x)
_paragraph_18
 aa
_paragraph_19
 limx→af(x)=f(a).limx→af(x)=f(a).
_paragraph_20
 Therefore, since f(a)f(a) is defined and limx→af(x)=f(a),limx→af(x)=f(a), we conclude that ff is continuous at a.a.

 □
_paragraph_26
 We have just proven that differentiability implies continuity, but now we consider whether continuity implies differentiability. To determine an answer to this question, we examine the function f(x)=|x|.f(x)=|x|. This function is continuous everywhere; however, f′(0)f′(0) is undefined. This observation leads us to believe that continuity does not imply differentiability. Let’s explore further. For f(x)=|x|,f(x)=|x|,
_paragraph_27
 f(x)=|x|.f(x)=|x|.
_paragraph_28
 f′(0)f′(0)

 Let’s consider some additional situations in which a continuous function fails to be differentiable. Consider the function f(x)=x3:f(x)=x3:
_paragraph_36
 f(x)=x3:f(x)=x3:
_paragraph_37
 Thus f′(0)f′(0) does not exist. A quick look at the graph of f(x)=x3f(x)=x3 clarifies the situation. The function has a vertical tangent line at 00 (Figure 3.15).

 The function f(x)={xsin(1x)ifx≠00ifx=0f(x)={xsin(1x)ifx≠00ifx=0 also has a derivative that exhibits interesting behavior at 0.0. We see that

 For the function to be continuous at x=−10,limx→−10−f(x)=f(−10).x=−10,limx→−10−f(x)=f(−10). Thus, since
_paragraph_68
 x=−10,limx→−10−f(x)=f(−10).x=−10,limx→−10−f(x)=f(−10).
_paragraph_69
 and f(−10)=5,f(−10)=5, we must have 10−10b+c=5.10−10b+c=5. Equivalently, we have c=10b−5.c=10b−5.

Proof,"_paragraph_1
 If f(x)f(x) is differentiable at a,a, then f′(a)f′(a) exists and
_paragraph_2
 f(x)f(x)
_paragraph_3
 a,a,
_paragraph_4
 f′(a)f′(a)
_paragraph_5
 We want to show that f(x)f(x) is continuous at aa by showing that limx→af(x)=f(a).limx→af(x)=f(a). Thus,
_paragraph_6
 f(x)f(x)
_paragraph_7
 aa
_paragraph_8
 limx→af(x)=f(a).limx→af(x)=f(a).
_paragraph_9
 Therefore, since f(a)f(a) is defined and limx→af(x)=f(a),limx→af(x)=f(a), we conclude that ff is continuous at a.a.
_paragraph_10
 f(a)f(a)

 limx→af(x)=f(a),limx→af(x)=f(a),

_paragraph_15
 We have just proven that differentiability implies continuity, but now we consider whether continuity implies differentiability. To determine an answer to this question, we examine the function f(x)=|x|.f(x)=|x|. This function is continuous everywhere; however, f′(0)f′(0) is undefined. This observation leads us to believe that continuity does not imply differentiability. Let’s explore further. For f(x)=|x|,f(x)=|x|,
_paragraph_16
 f(x)=|x|.f(x)=|x|.
_paragraph_17
 f′(0)f′(0)
_paragraph_18
 f(x)=|x|,f(x)=|x|,
_paragraph_19
 This limit does not exist because

_paragraph_23
 The function f(x)=|x|f(x)=|x| is continuous at 00 but is not differentiable at 0.0.
_paragraph_24
 Let’s consider some additional situations in which a continuous function fails to be differentiable. Consider the function f(x)=x3:f(x)=x3:
_paragraph_25
 f(x)=x3:f(x)=x3:
_paragraph_26
 Thus f′(0)f′(0) does not exist. A quick look at the graph of f(x)=x3f(x)=x3 clarifies the situation. The function has a vertical tangent line at 00 (Figure 3.15).

_paragraph_31

_paragraph_32
 The function f(x)=x3f(x)=x3 has a vertical tangent at x=0.x=0. It is continuous at 00 but is not differentiable at 0.0.
_paragraph_33
 The function f(x)={xsin(1x)ifx≠00ifx=0f(x)={xsin(1x)ifx≠00ifx=0 also has a derivative that exhibits interesting behavior at 0.0. We see that
_paragraph_34
 f(x)={xsin(1x)ifx≠00ifx=0f(x)={xsin(1x)ifx≠00ifx=0
_paragraph_35
 0.0.
_paragraph_36
 This limit does not exist, essentially because the slopes of the secant lines continuously change direction as they approach zero (Figure 3.16).

 The function f(x)={xsin(1x)ifx≠00ifx=0f(x)={xsin(1x)ifx≠00ifx=0 is not differentiable at 0.0.

 A toy company wants to design a track for a toy car that starts out along a parabolic curve and then converts to a straight line (Figure 3.17). The function that describes the track is to have the form f(x)={110x2+bx+cifx<−10−14x+52ifx≥−10f(x)={110x2+bx+cifx<−10−14x+52ifx≥−10 where xx and f(x)f(x) are in inches. For the car to move smoothly along the track, the function f(x)f(x) must be both continuous and differentiable at −10.−10. Find values of bb and cc that make f(x)f(x) both continuous and differentiable.

 For the car to move smoothly along the track, the function must be both continuous and differentiable.
_paragraph_55
 Solution
_paragraph_56
 For the function to be continuous at x=−10,limx→−10−f(x)=f(−10).x=−10,limx→−10−f(x)=f(−10). Thus, since
_paragraph_57
 x=−10,limx→−10−f(x)=f(−10).x=−10,limx→−10−f(x)=f(−10).
_paragraph_58
 and f(−10)=5,f(−10)=5, we must have 10−10b+c=5.10−10b+c=5. Equivalently, we have c=10b−5.c=10b−5.
_paragraph_59
 f(−10)=5,f(−10)=5,
_paragraph_60
 10−10b+c=5.10−10b+c=5.
_paragraph_61
 c=10b−5.c=10b−5.
_paragraph_62
 For the function to be differentiable at −10,−10,
_paragraph_63
 −10,−10,
_paragraph_64
 must exist. Since f(x)f(x) is defined using different rules on the right and the left, we must evaluate this limit from the right and the left and then set them equal to each other:
_paragraph_65
 f(x)f(x)
_paragraph_66
 We also have
_paragraph_67
 This gives us b−2=−14.b−2=−14. Thus b=74b=74 and c=10(74)−5=252.c=10(74)−5=252.
_paragraph_68
 b−2=−14.b−2=−14.

Higher-Order Derivatives,"_paragraph_1
 The derivative of a function is itself a function, so we can find the derivative of a derivative. For example, the derivative of a position function is the rate of change of position, or velocity. The derivative of velocity is the rate of change of velocity, which is acceleration. The new function obtained by differentiating the derivative is called the second derivative. Furthermore, we can continue to take derivatives to obtain the third derivative, fourth derivative, and so on. Collectively, these are referred to as higher-order derivatives. The notation for the higher-order derivatives of y=f(x)y=f(x) can be expressed in any of the following forms:
_paragraph_2
 higher-order derivatives
_paragraph_3
 y=f(x)y=f(x)

 It is interesting to note that the notation for d2ydx2d2ydx2 may be viewed as an attempt to express ddx(dydx)ddx(dydx) more compactly. Analogously, ddx(ddx(dydx))=ddx(d2ydx2)=d3ydx3.ddx(ddx(dydx))=ddx(d2ydx2)=d3ydx3.

The Basic Rules,"_paragraph_1
 The functions f(x)=cf(x)=c and g(x)=xng(x)=xn where nn is a positive integer are the building blocks from which all polynomials and rational functions are constructed. To find derivatives of polynomials and rational functions efficiently without resorting to the limit definition of the derivative, we must first develop formulas for differentiating these basic functions.
_paragraph_2
 f(x)=cf(x)=c
_paragraph_3
 g(x)=xng(x)=xn
_paragraph_4
 nn
_paragraph_5
 We first apply the limit definition of the derivative to find the derivative of the constant function, f(x)=c.f(x)=c. For this function, both f(x)=cf(x)=c and f(x+h)=c,f(x+h)=c, so we obtain the following result:
_paragraph_6
 f(x)=c.f(x)=c.
_paragraph_7
 f(x)=cf(x)=c
_paragraph_8
 f(x+h)=c,f(x+h)=c,
_paragraph_9
 The rule for differentiating constant functions is called the constant rule. It states that the derivative of a constant function is zero; that is, since a constant function is a horizontal line, the slope, or the rate of change, of a constant function is 0.0. We restate this rule in the following theorem.

 We have shown that

 At this point, you might see a pattern beginning to develop for derivatives of the form ddx(xn).ddx(xn). We continue our examination of derivative formulas by differentiating power functions of the form f(x)=xnf(x)=xn where nn is a positive integer. We develop formulas for derivatives of this type of function in stages, beginning with positive integer powers. Before stating and proving the general rule for derivatives of functions of this form, we take a look at a specific case, ddx(x3).ddx(x3). As we go through this derivation, note that the technique used in this case is essentially the same as the technique used to prove the general case.

 As we shall see, the procedure for finding the derivative of the general form f(x)=xnf(x)=xn is very similar. Although it is often unwise to draw general conclusions from specific examples, we note that when we differentiate f(x)=x3,f(x)=x3, the power on xx becomes the coefficient of x2x2 in the derivative and the power on xx in the derivative decreases by 1. The following theorem states that the power rule holds for all positive integer powers of x.x. We will eventually extend this result to negative integer powers. Later, we will see that this rule may also be extended first to rational powers of xx and then to arbitrary powers of x.x. Be aware, however, that this rule does not apply to functions in which a constant is raised to a variable power, such as f(x)=3x.f(x)=3x.

"The Sum, Difference, and Constant Multiple Rules","_paragraph_1
 We find our next differentiation rules by looking at derivatives of sums, differences, and constant multiples of functions. Just as when we work with functions, there are rules that make it easier to find derivatives of functions that we add, subtract, or multiply by a constant. These rules are summarized in the following theorem.

 We provide only the proof of the sum rule here. The rest follow in a similar manner.
_paragraph_24
 For differentiable functions f(x)f(x) and g(x),g(x), we set j(x)=f(x)+g(x).j(x)=f(x)+g(x). Using the limit definition of the derivative we have
_paragraph_25
 f(x)f(x)
_paragraph_26
 g(x),g(x),
_paragraph_27
 j(x)=f(x)+g(x).j(x)=f(x)+g(x).
_paragraph_28
 By substituting j(x+h)=f(x+h)+g(x+h)j(x+h)=f(x+h)+g(x+h) and j(x)=f(x)+g(x),j(x)=f(x)+g(x), we obtain
_paragraph_29
 j(x+h)=f(x+h)+g(x+h)j(x+h)=f(x+h)+g(x+h)
_paragraph_30
 j(x)=f(x)+g(x),j(x)=f(x)+g(x),
_paragraph_31
 Rearranging and regrouping the terms, we have

 We now apply the sum law for limits and the definition of the derivative to obtain

 To find the equation of the tangent line, we need a point and a slope. To find the point, compute

 This gives us the point (1,3).(1,3). Since the slope of the tangent line at 1 is f′(1),f′(1), we must first find f′(x).f′(x). Using the definition of a derivative, we have

The Product Rule,"_paragraph_1
 Now that we have examined the basic rules, we can begin looking at some of the more advanced rules. The first one examines the derivative of the product of two functions. Although it might be tempting to assume that the derivative of the product is the product of the derivatives, similar to the sum and difference rules, the product rule does not follow this pattern. To see why we cannot use this pattern, consider the function f(x)=x2,f(x)=x2, whose derivative is f′(x)=2xf′(x)=2x and not ddx(x)·ddx(x)=1·1=1.ddx(x)·ddx(x)=1·1=1.

 This means that the derivative of a product of two functions is the derivative of the first function times the second function plus the derivative of the second function times the first function.
_paragraph_14
 We begin by assuming that f(x)f(x) and g(x)g(x) are differentiable functions. At a key point in this proof we need to use the fact that, since g(x)g(x) is differentiable, it is also continuous. In particular, we use the fact that since g(x)g(x) is continuous, limh→0g(x+h)=g(x).limh→0g(x+h)=g(x).

 Having developed and practiced the product rule, we now consider differentiating quotients of functions. As we see in the following theorem, the derivative of the quotient is not the quotient of the derivatives; rather, it is the derivative of the function in the numerator times the function in the denominator minus the derivative of the function in the denominator times the function in the numerator, all divided by the square of the function in the denominator.

 f(x)=6x2.f(x)=6x2.
_paragraph_25
 Solution
_paragraph_26
 It may seem tempting to use the quotient rule to find this derivative, and it would certainly not be incorrect to do so. However, it is far easier to differentiate this function by first rewriting it as f(x)=6x−2.f(x)=6x−2.

Combining Differentiation Rules,"_paragraph_1
 As we have seen throughout the examples in this section, it seldom happens that we are called on to apply just one differentiation rule to find the derivative of a given function. At this point, by combining the differentiation rules, we may find the derivatives of any polynomial or rational function. Later on we will encounter more complex combinations of differentiation rules. A good rule of thumb to use when applying several rules is to apply the rules in reverse of the order in which we would evaluate the function.

 We can think of the function k(x)k(x) as the product of the function f(x)g(x)f(x)g(x) and the function h(x).h(x). That is, k(x)=(f(x)g(x))·h(x).k(x)=(f(x)g(x))·h(x). Thus,

 f′(x)=0.f′(x)=0.

 we must solve (3x−2)(x−4)=0.(3x−2)(x−4)=0. Thus we see that the function has horizontal tangent lines at x=23x=23 and x=4x=4 as shown in the following graph.

 Since the initial velocity is v(0)=s′(0),v(0)=s′(0), begin by finding s′(t)s′(t) by applying the quotient rule:
_paragraph_56
 v(0)=s′(0),v(0)=s′(0),

 s′(t)s′(t)

 Formula One Grandstands
_paragraph_68
 Formula One car races can be very exciting to watch and attract a lot of spectators. Formula One track designers have to ensure sufficient grandstand space is available around the track to accommodate these viewers. However, car racing can be dangerous, and safety considerations are paramount. The grandstands must be placed where spectators will not be in danger should a driver lose control of a car (Figure 3.20).

_paragraph_71
 The grandstand next to a straightaway of the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya race track, located where the spectators are not in danger.
_paragraph_72
 Safety is especially a concern on turns. If a driver does not slow down enough before entering the turn, the car may slide off the racetrack. Normally, this just results in a wider turn, which slows the driver down. But if the driver loses control completely, the car may fly off the track entirely, on a path tangent to the curve of the racetrack.
_paragraph_73
 Suppose you are designing a new Formula One track. One section of the track can be modeled by the function f(x)=x3+3x2+xf(x)=x3+3x2+x (Figure 3.21). The current plan calls for grandstands to be built along the first straightaway and around a portion of the first curve. The plans call for the front corner of the grandstand to be located at the point (−1.9,2.8).(−1.9,2.8). We want to determine whether this location puts the spectators in danger if a driver loses control of the car.

Amount of Change Formula,"_paragraph_1
 One application for derivatives is to estimate an unknown value of a function at a point by using a known value of a function at some given point together with its rate of change at the given point. If f(x)f(x) is a function defined on an interval [a,a+h],[a,a+h], then the amount of change of f(x)f(x) over the interval is the change in the yy values of the function over that interval and is given by

 For small enough values of h,f′(a)≈f(a+h)−f(a)h.h,f′(a)≈f(a+h)−f(a)h. We can then solve for f(a+h)f(a+h) to get the amount of change formula:

Thus, we can state the following mathematical definitions.

The population growth rate is the rate of change of a population and consequently can be represented by the derivative of the size of the population.

Changes in Cost and Revenue,"_paragraph_1
 In addition to analyzing motion along a line and population growth, derivatives are useful in analyzing changes in cost, revenue, and profit. The concept of a marginal function is common in the fields of business and economics and implies the use of derivatives. The marginal cost is the derivative of the cost function. The marginal revenue is the derivative of the revenue function. The marginal profit is the derivative of the profit function, which is based on the cost function and the revenue function.

Consequently, C′(x)C′(x) for a given value of xx can be thought of as the change in cost associated with producing one additional item. In a similar way, MR(x)=R′(x)MR(x)=R′(x) approximates the revenue obtained by selling one additional item, and MP(x)=P′(x)MP(x)=P′(x) approximates the profit obtained by producing and selling one additional item.

_paragraph_39
 First find v(t)=s′(t):v(t)=s′(t):
_paragraph_40
 v(t)=s′(t):v(t)=s′(t):
_paragraph_41
 Thus,
_paragraph_42
 Next, find a(t)=v′(t).a(t)=v′(t). Thus, a(t)=v′(t)=sinta(t)=v′(t)=sint and we have
_paragraph_43
 a(t)=v′(t).a(t)=v′(t).
_paragraph_44
 a(t)=v′(t)=sinta(t)=v′(t)=sint
_paragraph_45
 Since v(π4)=−12<0v(π4)=−12<0 and a(π4)=12>0,a(π4)=12>0, we see that velocity and acceleration are acting in opposite directions; that is, the object is being accelerated in the direction opposite to the direction in which it is travelling. Consequently, the particle is slowing down.

Deriving the Chain Rule,"_paragraph_1
 When we have a function that is a composition of two or more functions, we could use all of the techniques we have already learned to differentiate it. However, using all of those techniques to break down a function into simpler parts that we are able to differentiate can get cumbersome. Instead, we use the chain rule, which states that the derivative of a composite function is the derivative of the outer function evaluated at the inner function times the derivative of the inner function.
_paragraph_2
 chain rule
_paragraph_3
 To put this rule into context, let’s take a look at an example: h(x)=sin(x3).h(x)=sin(x3). We can think of the derivative of this function with respect to x as the rate of change of sin(x3)sin(x3) relative to the change in x.x. Consequently, we want to know how sin(x3)sin(x3) changes as xx changes. We can think of this event as a chain reaction: As xx changes, x3x3 changes, which leads to a change in sin(x3).sin(x3). This chain reaction gives us hints as to what is involved in computing the derivative of sin(x3).sin(x3). First of all, a change in xx forcing a change in x3x3 suggests that somehow the derivative of x3x3 is involved. In addition, the change in x3x3 forcing a change in sin(x3)sin(x3) suggests that the derivative of sin(u)sin(u) with respect to u,u, where u=x3,u=x3, is also part of the final derivative.

 We can take a more formal look at the derivative of h(x)=sin(x3)h(x)=sin(x3) by setting up the limit that would give us the derivative at a specific value aa in the domain of h(x)=sin(x3).h(x)=sin(x3).
_paragraph_22
 h(x)=sin(x3)h(x)=sin(x3)
_paragraph_23
 aa
_paragraph_24
 h(x)=sin(x3).h(x)=sin(x3).
_paragraph_25
 This expression does not seem particularly helpful; however, we can modify it by multiplying and dividing by the expression x3−a3x3−a3 to obtain
_paragraph_26
 x3−a3x3−a3
_paragraph_27
 From the definition of the derivative, we can see that the second factor is the derivative of x3x3 at x=a.x=a. That is,
_paragraph_28
 x3x3
_paragraph_29
 x=a.x=a.
_paragraph_30
 However, it might be a little more challenging to recognize that the first term is also a derivative. We can see this by letting u=x3u=x3 and observing that as x→a,u→a3:x→a,u→a3:
_paragraph_31
 u=x3u=x3
_paragraph_32
 x→a,u→a3:x→a,u→a3:
_paragraph_33
 Thus, h′(a)=cos(a3)·3a2.h′(a)=cos(a3)·3a2.
_paragraph_34
 h′(a)=cos(a3)·3a2.h′(a)=cos(a3)·3a2.
_paragraph_35
 In other words, if h(x)=sin(x3),h(x)=sin(x3), then h′(x)=cos(x3)·3x2.h′(x)=cos(x3)·3x2. Thus, if we think of h(x)=sin(x3)h(x)=sin(x3) as the composition (f∘g)(x)=f(g(x))(f∘g)(x)=f(g(x)) where f(x)=f(x)= sin xx and g(x)=x3,g(x)=x3, then the derivative of h(x)=sin(x3)h(x)=sin(x3) is the product of the derivative of g(x)=x3g(x)=x3 and the derivative of the function f(x)=sinxf(x)=sinx evaluated at the function g(x)=x3.g(x)=x3. At this point, we anticipate that for h(x)=sin(g(x)),h(x)=sin(g(x)), it is quite likely that h′(x)=cos(g(x))g′(x).h′(x)=cos(g(x))g′(x). As we determined above, this is the case for h(x)=sin(x3).h(x)=sin(x3).
_paragraph_36

 Problem-Solving Strategy: Applying the Chain Rule

 Note: When applying the chain rule to the composition of two or more functions, keep in mind that we work our way from the outside function in. It is also useful to remember that the derivative of the composition of two functions can be thought of as having two parts; the derivative of the composition of three functions has three parts; and so on. Also, remember that we never evaluate a derivative at a derivative.",,,
The Chain and Power Rules Combined,"_paragraph_1
 We can now apply the chain rule to composite functions, but note that we often need to use it with other rules. For example, to find derivatives of functions of the form h(x)=(g(x))n,h(x)=(g(x))n, we need to use the chain rule combined with the power rule. To do so, we can think of h(x)=(g(x))nh(x)=(g(x))n as f(g(x))f(g(x)) where f(x)=xn.f(x)=xn. Then f′(x)=nxn−1.f′(x)=nxn−1. Thus, f′(g(x))=n(g(x))n−1.f′(g(x))=n(g(x))n−1. This leads us to the derivative of a power function using the chain rule,
_paragraph_2
 h(x)=(g(x))n,h(x)=(g(x))n,
_paragraph_3
 h(x)=(g(x))nh(x)=(g(x))n

 Because we are finding an equation of a line, we need a point. The x-coordinate of the point is 2. To find the y-coordinate, substitute 2 into h(x).h(x). Since h(2)=1(3(2)−5)2=1,h(2)=1(3(2)−5)2=1, the point is (2,1).(2,1).

 h′(2)=−6(3(2)−5)−3=−6.h′(2)=−6(3(2)−5)−3=−6.

Combining the Chain Rule with Other Rules,"_paragraph_1
 Now that we can combine the chain rule and the power rule, we examine how to combine the chain rule with the other rules we have learned. In particular, we can use it with the formulas for the derivatives of trigonometric functions or with the product rule.

_paragraph_3

_paragraph_4
 Find the derivative of h(x)=cos(g(x)).h(x)=cos(g(x)).
_paragraph_5
 h(x)=cos(g(x)).h(x)=cos(g(x)).
_paragraph_6
 Solution
_paragraph_7
 Think of h(x)=cos(g(x))h(x)=cos(g(x)) as f(g(x))f(g(x)) where f(x)=cosx.f(x)=cosx. Since f′(x)=−sinx.f′(x)=−sinx. we have f′(g(x))=−sin(g(x)).f′(g(x))=−sin(g(x)). Then we do the following calculation.
_paragraph_8
 h(x)=cos(g(x))h(x)=cos(g(x))
_paragraph_9
 f(g(x))f(g(x))
_paragraph_10
 f(x)=cosx.f(x)=cosx.
_paragraph_11
 f′(x)=−sinx.f′(x)=−sinx.
_paragraph_12
 f′(g(x))=−sin(g(x)).f′(g(x))=−sin(g(x)).
_paragraph_13
 Thus, the derivative of h(x)=cos(g(x))h(x)=cos(g(x)) is given by h′(x)=−sin(g(x))g′(x).h′(x)=−sin(g(x))g′(x).
_paragraph_14
 h(x)=cos(g(x))h(x)=cos(g(x))
_paragraph_15
 h′(x)=−sin(g(x))g′(x).h′(x)=−sin(g(x))g′(x).

 h(x)=sec(g(x))h(x)=sec(g(x))
_paragraph_32
 In this problem, g(x)=4x5+2x,g(x)=4x5+2x, so we have g′(x)=20x4+2.g′(x)=20x4+2. Therefore, we obtain
_paragraph_33
 g(x)=4x5+2x,g(x)=4x5+2x,

 At this point we provide a list of derivative formulas that may be obtained by applying the chain rule in conjunction with the formulas for derivatives of trigonometric functions. Their derivations are similar to those used in Example 3.51 and Example 3.53. For convenience, formulas are also given in Leibniz’s notation, which some students find easier to remember.

Composites of Three or More Functions,"_paragraph_1
 We can now combine the chain rule with other rules for differentiating functions, but when we are differentiating the composition of three or more functions, we need to apply the chain rule more than once. If we look at this situation in general terms, we can generate a formula, but we do not need to remember it, as we can simply apply the chain rule multiple times.

For simplicity’s sake we ignore certain issues: For example, we assume that g(x)≠g(a)g(x)≠g(a) for x≠ax≠a in some open interval containing a.a. We begin by applying the limit definition of the derivative to the function h(x)h(x) to obtain h′(a):h′(a):

Proof,"_paragraph_1
 At this point, we present a very informal proof of the chain rule. For simplicity’s sake we ignore certain issues: For example, we assume that g(x)≠g(a)g(x)≠g(a) for x≠ax≠a in some open interval containing a.a. We begin by applying the limit definition of the derivative to the function h(x)h(x) to obtain h′(a):h′(a):
_paragraph_2
 g(x)≠g(a)g(x)≠g(a)
_paragraph_3
 x≠ax≠a
_paragraph_4
 a.a.
_paragraph_5
 h(x)h(x)
_paragraph_6
 h′(a):h′(a):
_paragraph_7
 Rewriting, we obtain
_paragraph_8
 Although it is clear that
_paragraph_9
 it is not obvious that
_paragraph_10
 To see that this is true, first recall that since g is differentiable at a,ga,g is also continuous at a.a. Thus,
_paragraph_11
 a,ga,g
_paragraph_12
 a.a.
_paragraph_13
 Next, make the substitution y=g(x)y=g(x) and b=g(a)b=g(a) and use change of variables in the limit to obtain
_paragraph_14
 y=g(x)y=g(x)
_paragraph_15
 b=g(a)b=g(a)

The Chain Rule Using Leibniz’s Notation,"_paragraph_1
 As with other derivatives that we have seen, we can express the chain rule using Leibniz’s notation. This notation for the chain rule is used heavily in physics applications.
_paragraph_2
 Forh(x)=f(g(x)),Forh(x)=f(g(x)), let u=g(x)u=g(x) and y=h(x)=f(u).y=h(x)=f(u). Thus,

 Forh(x)=f(g(x)),Forh(x)=f(g(x)),

The Derivative of an Inverse Function,"_paragraph_1
 We begin by considering a function and its inverse. If f(x)f(x) is both invertible and differentiable, it seems reasonable that the inverse of f(x)f(x) is also differentiable. Figure 3.28 shows the relationship between a function f(x)f(x) and its inverse f−1(x).f−1(x). Look at the point (a,f−1(a))(a,f−1(a)) on the graph of f−1(x)f−1(x) having a tangent line with a slope of (f−1)′(a)=pq.(f−1)′(a)=pq. This point corresponds to a point (f−1(a),a)(f−1(a),a) on the graph of f(x)f(x) having a tangent line with a slope of f′(f−1(a))=qp.f′(f−1(a))=qp. Thus, if f−1(x)f−1(x) is differentiable at a,a, then it must be the case that
_paragraph_2

 The tangent lines of a function and its inverse are related; so, too, are the derivatives of these functions.

 We may also derive the formula for the derivative of the inverse by first recalling that x=f(f−1(x)).x=f(f−1(x)). Then by differentiating both sides of this equation (using the chain rule on the right), we obtain
_paragraph_18
 x=f(f−1(x)).x=f(f−1(x)).

 Solving for (f−1)′(x),(f−1)′(x), we obtain

Derivatives of Inverse Trigonometric Functions,"_paragraph_1
 We now turn our attention to finding derivatives of inverse trigonometric functions. These derivatives will prove invaluable in the study of integration later in this text. The derivatives of inverse trigonometric functions are quite surprising in that their derivatives are actually algebraic functions. Previously, derivatives of algebraic functions have proven to be algebraic functions and derivatives of trigonometric functions have been shown to be trigonometric functions. Here, for the first time, we see that the derivative of a function need not be of the same type as the original function.

We begin by considering the case where 0<θ<π2.0<θ<π2. Since θθ is an acute angle, we may construct a right triangle having acute angle θ,θ, a hypotenuse of length 11 and the side opposite angle θθ having length x.x. From the Pythagorean theorem, the side adjacent to angle θθ has length 1−x2.1−x2. This triangle is shown in Figure 3.29. Using the triangle, we see that cos(sin−1x)=cosθ=1−x2.cos(sin−1x)=cosθ=1−x2.

 h(x)=sin−1(g(x)),h(x)=sin−1(g(x)),
_paragraph_54
 Now let g(x)=2x3,g(x)=2x3, so g′(x)=6x2.g′(x)=6x2. Substituting into the previous result, we obtain
_paragraph_55
 g(x)=2x3,g(x)=2x3,
_paragraph_56
 g′(x)=6x2.g′(x)=6x2.

Implicit Differentiation,"_paragraph_1
 In most discussions of math, if the dependent variable yy is a function of the independent variable x,x, we express y in terms of x.x. If this is the case, we say that yy is an explicit function of x.x. For example, when we write the equation y=x2+1,y=x2+1, we are defining y explicitly in terms of x.x. On the other hand, if the relationship between the function yy and the variable xx is expressed by an equation where yy is not expressed entirely in terms of x,x, we say that the equation defines y implicitly in terms of x.x. For example, the equation y−x2=1y−x2=1 defines the function y=x2+1y=x2+1 implicitly.

 Implicit differentiation allows us to find slopes of tangents to curves that are clearly not functions (they fail the vertical line test). We are using the idea that portions of yy are functions that satisfy the given equation, but that yy is not actually a function of x.x.

 The equation x2+y2=25x2+y2=25 defines many functions implicitly.
_paragraph_28
 If we want to find the slope of the line tangent to the graph of x2+y2=25x2+y2=25 at the point (3,4),(3,4), we could evaluate the derivative of the function y=25−x2y=25−x2 at x=3.x=3. On the other hand, if we want the slope of the tangent line at the point (3,−4),(3,−4), we could use the derivative of y=−25−x2.y=−25−x2. However, it is not always easy to solve for a function defined implicitly by an equation. Fortunately, the technique of implicit differentiation allows us to find the derivative of an implicitly defined function without ever solving for the function explicitly. The process of finding dydxdydx using implicit differentiation is described in the following problem-solving strategy.

 The slope of the tangent line is found by substituting (3,−4)(3,−4) into this expression. Consequently, the slope of the tangent line is dydx|(3,−4)=−3−4=34.dydx|(3,−4)=−3−4=34.

Derivative of the Exponential Function,"_paragraph_1
 Just as when we found the derivatives of other functions, we can find the derivatives of exponential and logarithmic functions using formulas. As we develop these formulas, we need to make certain basic assumptions. The proofs that these assumptions hold are beyond the scope of this course.
_paragraph_2
 First of all, we begin with the assumption that the function B(x)=bx,b>0,B(x)=bx,b>0, is defined for every real number and is continuous. In previous courses, the values of exponential functions for all rational numbers were defined—beginning with the definition of bn,bn, where nn is a positive integer—as the product of bb multiplied by itself nn times. Later, we defined b0=1,b−n=1bn,b0=1,b−n=1bn, for a positive integer n,n, and bs/t=(bt)sbs/t=(bt)s for positive integers ss and t.t. These definitions leave open the question of the value of brbr where rr is an arbitrary real number. By assuming the continuity of B(x)=bx,b>0,B(x)=bx,b>0, we may interpret brbr as limx→rbxlimx→rbx where the values of xx as we take the limit are rational. For example, we may view 4π4π as the number satisfying

 We also assume that for B(x)=bx,b>0,B(x)=bx,b>0, the value B′(0)B′(0) of the derivative exists. In this section, we show that by making this one additional assumption, it is possible to prove that the function B(x)B(x) is differentiable everywhere.

 We make one final assumption: that there is a unique value of b>0b>0 for which B′(0)=1.B′(0)=1. We define ee to be this unique value, as we did in Introduction to Functions and Graphs. Figure 3.33 provides graphs of the functions y=2x,y=3x,y=2.7x,y=2x,y=3x,y=2.7x, and y=2.8x.y=2.8x. A visual estimate of the slopes of the tangent lines to these functions at 0 provides evidence that the value of e lies somewhere between 2.7 and 2.8. The function E(x)=exE(x)=ex is called the natural exponential function. Its inverse, L(x)=logex=lnxL(x)=logex=lnx is called the natural logarithmic function.

 Now that we have laid out our basic assumptions, we begin our investigation by exploring the derivative of B(x)=bx,b>0.B(x)=bx,b>0. Recall that we have assumed that B′(0)B′(0) exists. By applying the limit definition to the derivative we conclude that
_paragraph_65
 B(x)=bx,b>0.B(x)=bx,b>0.
_paragraph_66

 Turning to B′(x),B′(x), we obtain the following.

_paragraph_70
 We see that on the basis of the assumption that B(x)=bxB(x)=bx is differentiable at 0,B(x)0,B(x) is not only differentiable everywhere, but its derivative is

 For E(x)=ex,E′(0)=1.E(x)=ex,E′(0)=1. Thus, we have E′(x)=ex.E′(x)=ex. (The value of B′(0)B′(0) for an arbitrary function of the form B(x)=bx,b>0,B(x)=bx,b>0, will be derived later.)

 To find the slope, we must evaluate dydxdydx at x=1.x=1. Using Equation 3.33, we see that

Proof,"_paragraph_1
 If x>0x>0 and y=lnx,y=lnx, then ey=x.ey=x. Differentiating both sides of this equation results in the equation
_paragraph_2
 x>0x>0
_paragraph_3
 y=lnx,y=lnx,
_paragraph_4
 ey=x.ey=x.
_paragraph_5
 Solving for dydxdydx yields
_paragraph_6
 dydxdydx
_paragraph_7
 Finally, we substitute x=eyx=ey to obtain
_paragraph_8
 x=eyx=ey
_paragraph_9
 We may also derive this result by applying the inverse function theorem, as follows. Since y=g(x)=lnxy=g(x)=lnx is the inverse of f(x)=ex,f(x)=ex, by applying the inverse function theorem we have
_paragraph_10
 y=g(x)=lnxy=g(x)=lnx
_paragraph_11
 f(x)=ex,f(x)=ex,
_paragraph_12
 Using this result and applying the chain rule to h(x)=ln(g(x))h(x)=ln(g(x)) yields
_paragraph_13
 h(x)=ln(g(x))h(x)=ln(g(x))

Proof,"_paragraph_1
 If y=logbx,y=logbx, then by=x.by=x. It follows that ln(by)=lnx.ln(by)=lnx. Thus ylnb=lnx.ylnb=lnx. Solving for y,y, we have y=lnxlnb.y=lnxlnb. Differentiating and keeping in mind that lnblnb is a constant, we see that
_paragraph_2
 y=logbx,y=logbx,

 by=x.by=x.

 ln(by)=lnx.ln(by)=lnx.

 The derivative in Equation 3.33 now follows from the chain rule.
_paragraph_10
 If y=bx,y=bx, then lny=xlnb.lny=xlnb. Using implicit differentiation, again keeping in mind that lnblnb is constant, it follows that 1ydydx=lnb.1ydydx=lnb. Solving for dydxdydx and substituting y=bx,y=bx, we see that

 y=bx,y=bx,

 lny=xlnb.lny=xlnb.

Logarithmic Differentiation,"_paragraph_1
 At this point, we can take derivatives of functions of the form y=(g(x))ny=(g(x))n for certain values of n,n, as well as functions of the form y=bg(x),y=bg(x), where b>0b>0 and b≠1.b≠1. Unfortunately, we still do not know the derivatives of functions such as y=xxy=xx or y=xπ.y=xπ. These functions require a technique called logarithmic differentiation, which allows us to differentiate any function of the form h(x)=g(x)f(x).h(x)=g(x)f(x). It can also be used to convert a very complex differentiation problem into a simpler one, such as finding the derivative of y=x2x+1exsin3x.y=x2x+1exsin3x. We outline this technique in the following problem-solving strategy.

 The slope of the tangent line to a curve measures the instantaneous rate of change of a curve. We can calculate it by finding the limit of the difference quotient or the difference quotient with increment h.h.
The derivative of a function f(x)f(x) at a value aa is found using either of the definitions for the slope of the tangent line.
Velocity is the rate of change of position. As such, the velocity v(t)v(t) at time tt is the derivative of the position s(t)s(t) at time t.t. Average velocity is given by

The graph of a derivative of a function f(x)f(x) is related to the graph of f(x).f(x). Where f(x)f(x) has a tangent line with positive slope, f′(x)>0.f′(x)>0. Where f(x)f(x) has a tangent line with negative slope, f′(x)<0.f′(x)<0. Where f(x)f(x) has a horizontal tangent line, f′(x)=0.f′(x)=0.
If a function is differentiable at a point, then it is continuous at that point. A function is not differentiable at a point if it is not continuous at the point, if it has a vertical tangent line at the point, or if the graph has a sharp corner or cusp.

The derivative of the difference of a function f and a function g is the same as the difference of the derivative of f and the derivative of g.
The derivative of a product of two functions is the derivative of the first function times the second function plus the derivative of the second function times the first function.
The derivative of the quotient of two functions is the derivative of the first function times the second function minus the derivative of the second function times the first function, all divided by the square of the second function.

 The Chain Rule","_list_1
 The chain rule allows us to differentiate compositions of two or more functions. It states that for h(x)=f(g(x)),h(x)=f(g(x)),
h′(x)=f′(g(x))g′(x).h′(x)=f′(g(x))g′(x).
In Leibniz’s notation this rule takes the form
dydx=dydu·dudx.dydx=dydu·dudx.
We can use the chain rule with other rules that we have learned, and we can derive formulas for some of them.
The chain rule combines with the power rule to form a new rule:
Ifh(x)=(g(x))n,thenh′(x)=n(g(x))n−1g′(x).Ifh(x)=(g(x))n,thenh′(x)=n(g(x))n−1g′(x).
When applied to the composition of three functions, the chain rule can be expressed as follows: If h(x)=f(g(k(x))),h(x)=f(g(k(x))), then h′(x)=f′(g(k(x))g′(k(x))k′(x).h′(x)=f′(g(k(x))g′(k(x))k′(x).",,

 In many real-world applications, related quantities are changing with respect to time. For example, if we consider the balloon example again, we can say that the rate of change in the volume, V,V, is related to the rate of change in the radius, r.r. In this case, we say that dVdtdVdt and drdtdrdt are related rates because V is related to r. Here we study several examples of related quantities that are changing with respect to time and we look at how to calculate one rate of change given another rate of change.

 Solution
_paragraph_16
 The volume of a sphere of radius rr centimeters is
_paragraph_17
 rr
_paragraph_18
 Since the balloon is being filled with air, both the volume and the radius are functions of time. Therefore, tt seconds after beginning to fill the balloon with air, the volume of air in the balloon is
_paragraph_19
 tt
_paragraph_20
 Differentiating both sides of this equation with respect to time and applying the chain rule, we see that the rate of change in the volume is related to the rate of change in the radius by the equation
_paragraph_21
 The balloon is being filled with air at the constant rate of 2 cm3/sec, so V′(t)=2cm3/sec.V′(t)=2cm3/sec. Therefore,

 V′(t)=2cm3/sec.V′(t)=2cm3/sec.

 Problem-Solving Strategy: Solving a Related-Rates Problem
_paragraph_33
 Note that when solving a related-rates problem, it is crucial not to substitute known values too soon. For example, if the value for a changing quantity is substituted into an equation before both sides of the equation are differentiated, then that quantity will behave as a constant and its derivative will not appear in the new equation found in step 4. We examine this potential error in the following example.",,,"_figure_1

 The volume of a sphere of radius rr centimeters is

 Since the balloon is being filled with air, both the volume and the radius are functions of time. Therefore, tt seconds after beginning to fill the balloon with air, the volume of air in the balloon is

 Differentiating both sides of this equation with respect to time and applying the chain rule, we see that the rate of change in the volume is related to the rate of change in the radius by the equation
_paragraph_7
 The balloon is being filled with air at the constant rate of 2 cm3/sec, so V′(t)=2cm3/sec.V′(t)=2cm3/sec. Therefore,

 V′(t)=2cm3/sec.V′(t)=2cm3/sec.

 Let’s now implement the strategy just described to solve several related-rates problems. The first example involves a plane flying overhead. The relationship we are studying is between the speed of the plane and the rate at which the distance between the plane and a person on the ground is changing.

_paragraph_4
 An airplane is flying overhead at a constant elevation of 4000ft.4000ft. A man is viewing the plane from a position 3000ft3000ft from the base of a radio tower. The airplane is flying horizontally away from the man. If the plane is flying at the rate of 600ft/sec,600ft/sec, at what rate is the distance between the man and the plane increasing when the plane passes over the radio tower?

 Step 1. Draw a picture, introducing variables to represent the different quantities involved.

_paragraph_12
 An airplane is flying at a constant height of 4000 ft. The distance between the person and the airplane and the person and the place on the ground directly below the airplane are changing. We denote those quantities with the variables ss and x,x, respectively.
_paragraph_13
 As shown, xx denotes the distance between the man and the position on the ground directly below the airplane. The variable ss denotes the distance between the man and the plane. Note that both xx and ss are functions of time. We do not introduce a variable for the height of the plane because it remains at a constant elevation of 4000ft.4000ft. Since an object’s height above the ground is measured as the shortest distance between the object and the ground, the line segment of length 4000 ft is perpendicular to the line segment of length xx feet, creating a right triangle.

_paragraph_18
 4000ft.4000ft.
_paragraph_19
 xx
_paragraph_20
 Step 2. Since xx denotes the horizontal distance between the man and the point on the ground below the plane, dx/dtdx/dt represents the speed of the plane. We are told the speed of the plane is 600 ft/sec. Therefore, dxdt=600dxdt=600 ft/sec. Since we are asked to find the rate of change in the distance between the man and the plane when the plane is directly above the radio tower, we need to find ds/dtds/dt when x=3000ft.x=3000ft.

 Step 3. From the figure, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to write an equation relating xx and s:s:

_paragraph_30
 Step 4. Differentiating this equation with respect to time and using the fact that the derivative of a constant is zero, we arrive at the equation
_paragraph_31
 Step 5. Find the rate at which the distance between the man and the plane is increasing when the plane is directly over the radio tower. That is, find dsdtdsdt when x=3000ft.x=3000ft. Since the speed of the plane is 600ft/sec,600ft/sec, we know that dxdt=600ft/sec.dxdt=600ft/sec. We are not given an explicit value for s;s; however, since we are trying to find dsdtdsdt when x=3000ft,x=3000ft, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to determine the distance ss when x=3000x=3000 and the height is 4000ft.4000ft. Solving the equation

_paragraph_42
 for s,s, we have s=5000fts=5000ft at the time of interest. Using these values, we conclude that ds/dtds/dt is a solution of the equation
_paragraph_43
 s,s,
_paragraph_44
 s=5000fts=5000ft
_paragraph_45
 ds/dtds/dt
_paragraph_46
 Therefore,
_paragraph_47
 Note: When solving related-rates problems, it is important not to substitute values for the variables too soon. For example, in step 3, we related the variable quantities x(t)x(t) and s(t)s(t) by the equation
_paragraph_48
 x(t)x(t)
_paragraph_49
 s(t)s(t)
_paragraph_50
 Since the plane remains at a constant height, it is not necessary to introduce a variable for the height, and we are allowed to use the constant 4000 to denote that quantity. However, the other two quantities are changing. If we mistakenly substituted x(t)=3000x(t)=3000 into the equation before differentiating, our equation would have been
_paragraph_51
 x(t)=3000x(t)=3000
_paragraph_52
 After differentiating, our equation would become
_paragraph_53
 As a result, we would incorrectly conclude that dsdt=0.dsdt=0.
_paragraph_54
 dsdt=0.dsdt=0.

_paragraph_73
 A camera is positioned 5000 ft from the launch pad of the rocket. The height of the rocket and the angle of the camera are changing with respect to time. We denote those quantities with the variables hh and θ,θ, respectively.
_paragraph_74
 Let hh denote the height of the rocket above the launch pad and θθ be the angle between the camera lens and the ground.
_paragraph_75
 hh
_paragraph_76
 θθ
_paragraph_77
 Step 2. We are trying to find the rate of change in the angle of the camera with respect to time when the rocket is 1000 ft off the ground. That is, we need to find dθdtdθdt when h=1000ft.h=1000ft. At that time, we know the velocity of the rocket is dhdt=600ft/sec.dhdt=600ft/sec.
_paragraph_78
 dθdtdθdt
_paragraph_79
 h=1000ft.h=1000ft.
_paragraph_80
 dhdt=600ft/sec.dhdt=600ft/sec.
_paragraph_81
 Step 3. Now we need to find an equation relating the two quantities that are changing with respect to time: hh and θ.θ. How can we create such an equation? Using the fact that we have drawn a right triangle, it is natural to think about trigonometric functions. Recall that tanθtanθ is the ratio of the length of the opposite side of the triangle to the length of the adjacent side. Thus, we have
_paragraph_82
 hh
_paragraph_83
 θ.θ.
_paragraph_84
 tanθtanθ
_paragraph_85
 This gives us the equation
_paragraph_86
 Step 4. Differentiating this equation with respect to time t,t, we obtain
_paragraph_87
 t,t,
_paragraph_88
 Step 5. We want to find dθdtdθdt when h=1000ft.h=1000ft. At this time, we know that dhdt=600ft/sec.dhdt=600ft/sec. We need to determine sec2θ.sec2θ. Recall that secθsecθ is the ratio of the length of the hypotenuse to the length of the adjacent side. We know the length of the adjacent side is 5000ft.5000ft. To determine the length of the hypotenuse, we use the Pythagorean theorem, where the length of one leg is 5000ft,5000ft, the length of the other leg is h=1000ft,h=1000ft, and the length of the hypotenuse is cc feet as shown in the following figure.
_paragraph_89
 dθdtdθdt

 h=1000ft.h=1000ft.

 dhdt=600ft/sec.dhdt=600ft/sec.

_paragraph_97
 cc
_paragraph_98
 We see that
_paragraph_99
 and we conclude that the hypotenuse is
_paragraph_100
 Therefore, when h=1000,h=1000, we have
_paragraph_101
 h=1000,h=1000,
_paragraph_102
 Recall from step 4 that the equation relating dθdtdθdt to our known values is
_paragraph_103
 dθdtdθdt
_paragraph_104
 When h=1000ft,h=1000ft, we know that dhdt=600ft/secdhdt=600ft/sec and sec2θ=2625.sec2θ=2625. Substituting these values into the previous equation, we arrive at the equation
_paragraph_105
 h=1000ft,h=1000ft,
_paragraph_106
 dhdt=600ft/secdhdt=600ft/sec
_paragraph_107
 sec2θ=2625.sec2θ=2625.
_paragraph_108
 Therefore, dθdt=326rad/sec.dθdt=326rad/sec.

 dθdt=326rad/sec.dθdt=326rad/sec.

_paragraph_135
 Step 3: The volume of water in the cone is
_paragraph_136
 From the figure, we see that we have similar triangles. Therefore, the ratio of the sides in the two triangles is the same. Therefore, rh=12rh=12 or r=h2.r=h2. Using this fact, the equation for volume can be simplified to
_paragraph_137
 rh=12rh=12

 r=h2.r=h2.

Linear Approximation of a Function at a Point,"_paragraph_1
 Consider a function ff that is differentiable at a point x=a.x=a. Recall that the tangent line to the graph of ff at aa is given by the equation
_paragraph_2

_paragraph_4

_paragraph_6
 For example, consider the function f(x)=1xf(x)=1x at a=2.a=2. Since ff is differentiable at x=2x=2 and f′(x)=−1x2,f′(x)=−1x2, we see that f′(2)=−14.f′(2)=−14. Therefore, the tangent line to the graph of ff at a=2a=2 is given by the equation
_paragraph_7
 f(x)=1xf(x)=1x
_paragraph_8
 a=2.a=2.

 Figure 4.7(a) shows a graph of f(x)=1xf(x)=1x along with the tangent line to ff at x=2.x=2. Note that for xx near 2, the graph of the tangent line is close to the graph of f.f. As a result, we can use the equation of the tangent line to approximate f(x)f(x) for xx near 2. For example, if x=2.1,x=2.1, the yy value of the corresponding point on the tangent line is
_paragraph_16

 Therefore, the tangent line gives us a fairly good approximation of f(2.1)f(2.1) (Figure 4.7(b)). However, note that for values of xx far from 2, the equation of the tangent line does not give us a good approximation. For example, if x=10,x=10, the yy-value of the corresponding point on the tangent line is

_paragraph_38
 In general, for a differentiable function f,f, the equation of the tangent line to ff at x=ax=a can be used to approximate f(x)f(x) for xx near a.a. Therefore, we can write

At the same time, it may seem odd to use a linear approximation when we can just push a few buttons on a calculator to evaluate 9.1.9.1. However, how does the calculator evaluate 9.1?9.1?

Differentials,"_paragraph_1
 We have seen that linear approximations can be used to estimate function values. They can also be used to estimate the amount a function value changes as a result of a small change in the input. To discuss this more formally, we define a related concept: differentials. Differentials provide us with a way of estimating the amount a function changes as a result of a small change in input values.
_paragraph_2
 differentials
_paragraph_3
 When we first looked at derivatives, we used the Leibniz notation dy/dxdy/dx to represent the derivative of yy with respect to x.x. Although we used the expressions dy and dx in this notation, they did not have meaning on their own. Here we see a meaning to the expressions dy and dx. Suppose y=f(x)y=f(x) is a differentiable function. Let dx be an independent variable that can be assigned any nonzero real number, and define the dependent variable dydy by

 It is important to notice that dydy is a function of both xx and dx.dx. The expressions dy and dx are called differentials. We can divide both sides of Equation 4.2 by dx,dx, which yields

 We now connect differentials to linear approximations. Differentials can be used to estimate the change in the value of a function resulting from a small change in input values. Consider a function ff that is differentiable at point a.a. Suppose the input xx changes by a small amount. We are interested in how much the output yy changes. If xx changes from aa to a+dx,a+dx, then the change in xx is dxdx (also denoted Δx),Δx), and the change in yy is given by

 That is,
_paragraph_51
 In other words, the actual change in the function ff if xx increases from aa to a+dxa+dx is approximately the difference between L(a+dx)L(a+dx) and f(a),f(a), where L(x)L(x) is the linear approximation of ff at a.a.

 The differential dy=f′(a)dxdy=f′(a)dx is used to approximate the actual change in yy if xx increases from aa to a+dx.a+dx.
_paragraph_72
 We now take a look at how to use differentials to approximate the change in the value of the function that results from a small change in the value of the input. Note the calculation with differentials is much simpler than calculating actual values of functions and the result is very close to what we would obtain with the more exact calculation.

Calculating the Amount of Error,"_paragraph_1
 Any type of measurement is prone to a certain amount of error. In many applications, certain quantities are calculated based on measurements. For example, the area of a circle is calculated by measuring the radius of the circle. An error in the measurement of the radius leads to an error in the computed value of the area. Here we examine this type of error and study how differentials can be used to estimate the error.
_paragraph_2
 Consider a function ff with an input that is a measured quantity. Suppose the exact value of the measured quantity is a,a, but the measured value is a+dx.a+dx. We say the measurement error is dx (or Δx).Δx). As a result, an error occurs in the calculated quantity f(x).f(x). This type of error is known as a propagated error and is given by
_paragraph_3
 ff

_paragraph_5

_paragraph_6
 Δx).Δx).
_paragraph_7
 f(x).f(x).
_paragraph_8
 propagated error
_paragraph_9
 Since all measurements are prone to some degree of error, we do not know the exact value of a measured quantity, so we cannot calculate the propagated error exactly. However, given an estimate of the accuracy of a measurement, we can use differentials to approximate the propagated error Δy.Δy. Specifically, if ff is a differentiable function at a,a, the propagated error is
_paragraph_10
 Δy.Δy.
_paragraph_11
 ff
_paragraph_12
 a,a,
_paragraph_13
 Unfortunately, we do not know the exact value a.a. However, we can use the measured value a+dx,a+dx, and estimate
_paragraph_14
 a.a.
_paragraph_15
 a+dx,a+dx,
_paragraph_16
 In the next example, we look at how differentials can be used to estimate the error in calculating the volume of a box if we assume the measurement of the side length is made with a certain amount of accuracy.
_paragraph_17
 Example

 Suppose the side length of a cube is measured to be 5 cm with an accuracy of 0.1 cm.

_paragraph_22
 4.10
_paragraph_23
 Estimate the error in the computed volume of a cube if the side length is measured to be 6 cm with an accuracy of 0.2 cm.
_paragraph_24
 The measurement error dx (=Δx)(=Δx) and the propagated error ΔyΔy are absolute errors. We are typically interested in the size of an error relative to the size of the quantity being measured or calculated. Given an absolute error ΔqΔq for a particular quantity, we define the relative error as Δqq,Δqq, where qq is the actual value of the quantity. The percentage error is the relative error expressed as a percentage. For example, if we measure the height of a ladder to be 63 in. when the actual height is 62 in., the absolute error is 1 in. but the relative error is 162=0.016,162=0.016, or 1.6%.1.6%. By comparison, if we measure the width of a piece of cardboard to be 8.25 in. when the actual width is 8 in., our absolute error is 1414 in., whereas the relative error is 0.258=132,0.258=132, or 3.1%.3.1%. Therefore, the percentage error in the measurement of the cardboard is larger, even though 0.25 in. is less than 1 in.

_paragraph_39
 An astronaut using a camera measures the radius of Earth as 4000 mi with an error of ±80±80 mi. Let’s use differentials to estimate the relative and percentage error of using this radius measurement to calculate the volume of Earth, assuming the planet is a perfect sphere.
_paragraph_40
 ±80±80
_paragraph_41
 Solution
_paragraph_42
 If the measurement of the radius is accurate to within ±80,±80, we have
_paragraph_43
 ±80,±80,
_paragraph_44
 Since the volume of a sphere is given by V=(43)πr3,V=(43)πr3, we have
_paragraph_45
 V=(43)πr3,V=(43)πr3,
_paragraph_46
 Using the measured radius of 4000 mi, we can estimate
_paragraph_47
 To estimate the relative error, consider dVV.dVV. Since we do not know the exact value of the volume V,V, use the measured radius r=4000mir=4000mi to estimate V.V. We obtain V≈(43)π(4000)3.V≈(43)π(4000)3. Therefore the relative error satisfies
_paragraph_48
 dVV.dVV.
_paragraph_49

_paragraph_50
 r=4000mir=4000mi
_paragraph_51
 V.V.

 V≈(43)π(4000)3.V≈(43)π(4000)3.

 Consider the function f(x)=x2+1f(x)=x2+1 over the interval (−∞,∞).(−∞,∞). As x→±∞,x→±∞, f(x)→∞.f(x)→∞. Therefore, the function does not have a largest value. However, since x2+1≥1x2+1≥1 for all real numbers xx and x2+1=1x2+1=1 when x=0,x=0, the function has a smallest value, 1, when x=0.x=0. We say that 1 is the absolute minimum of f(x)=x2+1f(x)=x2+1 and it occurs at x=0.x=0. We say that f(x)=x2+1f(x)=x2+1 does not have an absolute maximum (see the following figure).

 Let ff be a function defined over an interval II and let c∈I.c∈I. We say ff has an absolute maximum on II at cc if f(c)≥f(x)f(c)≥f(x) for all x∈I.x∈I. We say ff has an absolute minimum on II at cc if f(c)≤f(x)f(c)≤f(x) for all x∈I.x∈I. If ff has an absolute maximum on II at cc or an absolute minimum on II at c,c, we say ff has an absolute extremum on II at c.c.

 Before proceeding, let’s note two important issues regarding this definition. First, the term absolute here does not refer to absolute value. An absolute extremum may be positive, negative, or zero. Second, if a function ff has an absolute extremum over an interval II at c,c, the absolute extremum is f(c).f(c). The real number cc is a point in the domain at which the absolute extremum occurs. For example, consider the function f(x)=1/(x2+1)f(x)=1/(x2+1) over the interval (−∞,∞).(−∞,∞). Since

 for all real numbers x,x, we say ff has an absolute maximum over (−∞,∞)(−∞,∞) at x=0.x=0. The absolute maximum is f(0)=1.f(0)=1. It occurs at x=0,x=0, as shown in Figure 4.13(b).

 A function may have both an absolute maximum and an absolute minimum, just one extremum, or neither. Figure 4.13 shows several functions and some of the different possibilities regarding absolute extrema. However, the following theorem, called the Extreme Value Theorem, guarantees that a continuous function ff over a closed, bounded interval [a,b][a,b] has both an absolute maximum and an absolute minimum.

 The proof of the extreme value theorem is beyond the scope of this text. Typically, it is proved in a course on real analysis. There are a couple of key points to note about the statement of this theorem. For the extreme value theorem to apply, the function must be continuous over a closed, bounded interval. If the interval II is open or the function has even one point of discontinuity, the function may not have an absolute maximum or absolute minimum over I.I. For example, consider the functions shown in Figure 4.13(d), (e), and (f). All three of these functions are defined over bounded intervals. However, the function in graph (e) is the only one that has both an absolute maximum and an absolute minimum over its domain. The extreme value theorem cannot be applied to the functions in graphs (d) and (f) because neither of these functions is continuous over a closed, bounded interval. Although the function in graph (d) is defined over the closed interval [0,4],[0,4], the function is discontinuous at x=2.x=2. The function has an absolute maximum over [0,4][0,4] but does not have an absolute minimum. The function in graph (f) is continuous over the half-open interval [0,2),[0,2), but is not defined at x=2,x=2, and therefore is not continuous over a closed, bounded interval. The function has an absolute minimum over [0,2),[0,2), but does not have an absolute maximum over [0,2).[0,2). These two graphs illustrate why a function over a bounded interval may fail to have an absolute maximum and/or absolute minimum.

 Before looking at how to find absolute extrema, let’s examine the related concept of local extrema. This idea is useful in determining where absolute extrema occur.",,,"_figure_1

Local Extrema and Critical Points,"_paragraph_1
 Consider the function ff shown in Figure 4.14. The graph can be described as two mountains with a valley in the middle. The absolute maximum value of the function occurs at the higher peak, at x=2.x=2. However, x=0x=0 is also a point of interest. Although f(0)f(0) is not the largest value of f,f, the value f(0)f(0) is larger than f(x)f(x) for all xx near 0. We say ff has a local maximum at x=0.x=0. Similarly, the function ff does not have an absolute minimum, but it does have a local minimum at x=1x=1 because f(1)f(1) is less than f(x)f(x) for xx near 1.

 Given the graph of a function f,f, it is sometimes easy to see where a local maximum or local minimum occurs. However, it is not always easy to see, since the interesting features on the graph of a function may not be visible because they occur at a very small scale. Also, we may not have a graph of the function. In these cases, how can we use a formula for a function to determine where these extrema occur?
_paragraph_55
 f,f,
_paragraph_56
 To answer this question, let’s look at Figure 4.14 again. The local extrema occur at x=0,x=0, x=1,x=1, and x=2.x=2. Notice that at x=0x=0 and x=1,x=1, the derivative f′(x)=0.f′(x)=0. At x=2,x=2, the derivative f′(x)f′(x) does not exist, since the function ff has a corner there. In fact, if ff has a local extremum at a point x=c,x=c, the derivative f′(c)f′(c) must satisfy one of the following conditions: either f′(c)=0f′(c)=0 or f′(c)f′(c) is undefined. Such a value cc is known as a critical point and it is important in finding extreme values for functions.

Suppose ff has a local maximum at c.c. The case in which ff has a local minimum at cc can be handled similarly. There then exists an open interval II such that f(c)≥f(x)f(c)≥f(x) for all x∈I.x∈I.

 Note this theorem does not claim that a function ff must have a local extremum at a critical point. Rather, it states that critical points are candidates for local extrema. For example, consider the function f(x)=x3.f(x)=x3. We have f′(x)=3x2=0f′(x)=3x2=0 when x=0.x=0. Therefore, x=0x=0 is a critical point. However, f(x)=x3f(x)=x3 is increasing over (−∞,∞),(−∞,∞), and thus ff does not have a local extremum at x=0.x=0. In Figure 4.15, we see several different possibilities for critical points. In some of these cases, the functions have local extrema at critical points, whereas in other cases the functions do not. Note that these graphs do not show all possibilities for the behavior of a function at a critical point.

 Since f(c)f(c) is a local maximum, we see that f(x)−f(c)≤0f(x)−f(c)≤0 for xx near c.c. Therefore, for xx near c,c, but x>c,x>c, we have f(x)−f(c)x−c≤0.f(x)−f(c)x−c≤0. From Equation 4.4 we conclude that f′(c)≤0.f′(c)≤0. Similarly, it can be shown that f′(c)≥0.f′(c)≥0. Therefore, f′(c)=0.f′(c)=0.

 From Fermat’s theorem, we conclude that if ff has a local extremum at c,c, then either f′(c)=0f′(c)=0 or f′(c)f′(c) is undefined. In other words, local extrema can only occur at critical points.

 Note this theorem does not claim that a function ff must have a local extremum at a critical point. Rather, it states that critical points are candidates for local extrema. For example, consider the function f(x)=x3.f(x)=x3. We have f′(x)=3x2=0f′(x)=3x2=0 when x=0.x=0. Therefore, x=0x=0 is a critical point. However, f(x)=x3f(x)=x3 is increasing over (−∞,∞),(−∞,∞), and thus ff does not have a local extremum at x=0.x=0. In Figure 4.15, we see several different possibilities for critical points. In some of these cases, the functions have local extrema at critical points, whereas in other cases the functions do not. Note that these graphs do not show all possibilities for the behavior of a function at a critical point.

 Later in this chapter we look at analytical methods for determining whether a function actually has a local extremum at a critical point. For now, let’s turn our attention to finding critical points. We will use graphical observations to determine whether a critical point is associated with a local extremum.

Locating Absolute Extrema,"_paragraph_1
 The extreme value theorem states that a continuous function over a closed, bounded interval has an absolute maximum and an absolute minimum. As shown in Figure 4.13, one or both of these absolute extrema could occur at an endpoint. If an absolute extremum does not occur at an endpoint, however, it must occur at an interior point, in which case the absolute extremum is a local extremum. Therefore, by Fermat’s Theorem, the point cc at which the local extremum occurs must be a critical point. We summarize this result in the following theorem.

_paragraph_37

_paragraph_38
 At this point, we know how to locate absolute extrema for continuous functions over closed intervals. We have also defined local extrema and determined that if a function ff has a local extremum at a point c,c, then cc must be a critical point of f.f. However, cc being a critical point is not a sufficient condition for ff to have a local extremum at c.c. Later in this chapter, we show how to determine whether a function actually has a local extremum at a critical point. First, however, we need to introduce the Mean Value Theorem, which will help as we analyze the behavior of the graph of a function.

 Case 1: If f(x)=kf(x)=k for all x∈(a,b),x∈(a,b), then f′(x)=0f′(x)=0 for all x∈(a,b).x∈(a,b).

 Case 2: Since ff is a continuous function over the closed, bounded interval [a,b],[a,b], by the extreme value theorem, it has an absolute maximum. Also, since there is a point x∈(a,b)x∈(a,b) such that f(x)>k,f(x)>k, the absolute maximum is greater than k.k. Therefore, the absolute maximum does not occur at either endpoint. As a result, the absolute maximum must occur at an interior point c∈(a,b).c∈(a,b). Because ff has a maximum at an interior point c,c, and ff is differentiable at c,c, by Fermat’s theorem, f′(c)=0.f′(c)=0.

The Mean Value Theorem and Its Meaning,"_paragraph_1
 Rolle’s theorem is a special case of the Mean Value Theorem. In Rolle’s theorem, we consider differentiable functions ff defined on a closed interval [a,b][a,b] with f(a)=f(b)f(a)=f(b). The Mean Value Theorem generalizes Rolle’s theorem by considering functions that do not necessarily have equal value at the endpoints. Consequently, we can view the Mean Value Theorem as a slanted version of Rolle’s theorem (Figure 4.25). The Mean Value Theorem states that if ff is continuous over the closed interval [a,b][a,b] and differentiable over the open interval (a,b),(a,b), then there exists a point c∈(a,b)c∈(a,b) such that the tangent line to the graph of ff at cc is parallel to the secant line connecting (a,f(a))(a,f(a)) and (b,f(b)).(b,f(b)).

 The Mean Value Theorem says that for a function that meets its conditions, at some point the tangent line has the same slope as the secant line between the ends. For this function, there are two values c1c1 and c2c2 such that the tangent line to ff at c1c1 and c2c2 has the same slope as the secant line.

 Mean Value Theorem
_paragraph_19
 Let ff be continuous over the closed interval [a,b][a,b] and differentiable over the open interval (a,b).(a,b). Then, there exists at least one point c∈(a,b)c∈(a,b) such that

_paragraph_24
 The proof follows from Rolle’s theorem by introducing an appropriate function that satisfies the criteria of Rolle’s theorem. Consider the line connecting (a,f(a))(a,f(a)) and (b,f(b)).(b,f(b)). Since the slope of that line is
_paragraph_25
 (a,f(a))(a,f(a))
_paragraph_26
 (b,f(b)).(b,f(b)).
_paragraph_27
 and the line passes through the point (a,f(a)),(a,f(a)), the equation of that line can be written as

 The third corollary of the Mean Value Theorem discusses when a function is increasing and when it is decreasing. Recall that a function ff is increasing over II if f(x1)<f(x2)f(x1)<f(x2) whenever x1<x2,x1<x2, whereas ff is decreasing over II if f(x)1>f(x2)f(x)1>f(x2) whenever x1<x2.x1<x2. Using the Mean Value Theorem, we can show that if the derivative of a function is positive, then the function is increasing; if the derivative is negative, then the function is decreasing (Figure 4.29). We make use of this fact in the next section, where we show how to use the derivative of a function to locate local maximum and minimum values of the function, and how to determine the shape of the graph.

 The third corollary of the Mean Value Theorem discusses when a function is increasing and when it is decreasing. Recall that a function ff is increasing over II if f(x1)<f(x2)f(x1)<f(x2) whenever x1<x2,x1<x2, whereas ff is decreasing over II if f(x)1>f(x2)f(x)1>f(x2) whenever x1<x2.x1<x2. Using the Mean Value Theorem, we can show that if the derivative of a function is positive, then the function is increasing; if the derivative is negative, then the function is decreasing (Figure 4.29). We make use of this fact in the next section, where we show how to use the derivative of a function to locate local maximum and minimum values of the function, and how to determine the shape of the graph.

 This fact is important because it means that for a given function f,f, if there exists a function FF such that F′(x)=f(x);F′(x)=f(x); then, the only other functions that have a derivative equal to ff are F(x)+CF(x)+C for some constant C.C. We discuss this result in more detail later in the chapter.

 We will prove i.; the proof of ii. is similar. Suppose ff is not an increasing function on I.I. Then there exist aa and bb in II such that a<b,a<b, but f(a)>f(b).f(a)>f(b). Since ff is a differentiable function over I,I, by the Mean Value Theorem there exists c∈(a,b)c∈(a,b) such that

The First Derivative Test,"_paragraph_1
 Corollary 33 of the Mean Value Theorem showed that if the derivative of a function is positive over an interval II then the function is increasing over I.I. On the other hand, if the derivative of the function is negative over an interval I,I, then the function is decreasing over II as shown in the following figure.

 Both functions are increasing over the interval (a,b).(a,b). At each point x,x, the derivative f′(x)>0.f′(x)>0. Both functions are decreasing over the interval (a,b).(a,b). At each point x,x, the derivative f′(x)<0.f′(x)<0.
_paragraph_10
 A continuous function ff has a local maximum at point cc if and only if ff switches from increasing to decreasing at point c.c. Similarly, ff has a local minimum at cc if and only if ff switches from decreasing to increasing at c.c. If ff is a continuous function over an interval II containing cc and differentiable over I,I, except possibly at c,c, the only way ff can switch from increasing to decreasing (or vice versa) at point cc is if f′f′ changes sign as xx increases through c.c. If ff is differentiable at c,c, the only way that f′.f′. can change sign as xx increases through cc is if f′(c)=0.f′(c)=0. Therefore, for a function ff that is continuous over an interval II containing cc and differentiable over I,I, except possibly at c,c, the only way ff can switch from increasing to decreasing (or vice versa) is if f′(c)=0f′(c)=0 or f′(c)f′(c) is undefined. Consequently, to locate local extrema for a function f,f, we look for points cc in the domain of ff such that f′(c)=0f′(c)=0 or f′(c)f′(c) is undefined. Recall that such points are called critical points of f.f.

 Note that ff need not have local extrema at a critical point. The critical points are candidates for local extrema only. In Figure 4.31, we show that if a continuous function ff has a local extremum, it must occur at a critical point, but a function may not have a local extremum at a critical point. We show that if ff has a local extremum at a critical point, then the sign of f′f′ switches as xx increases through that point.

 Consider a function ff that is continuous over an interval I.I.

_paragraph_78
 Now let’s look at how to use this strategy to locate all local extrema for particular functions.
_paragraph_79
 Example
_paragraph_80
 4.17
_paragraph_81
 Use the first derivative test to find the location of all local extrema for f(x)=x3−3x2−9x−1.f(x)=x3−3x2−9x−1. Use a graphing utility to confirm your results.
_paragraph_82
 f(x)=x3−3x2−9x−1.f(x)=x3−3x2−9x−1.
_paragraph_83
 Solution
_paragraph_84
 Step 1. The derivative is f′(x)=3x2−6x−9.f′(x)=3x2−6x−9. To find the critical points, we need to find where f′(x)=0.f′(x)=0. Factoring the polynomial, we conclude that the critical points must satisfy
_paragraph_85
 f′(x)=3x2−6x−9.f′(x)=3x2−6x−9.
_paragraph_86
 f′(x)=0.f′(x)=0.
_paragraph_87
 Therefore, the critical points are x=3,−1.x=3,−1. Now divide the interval (−∞,∞)(−∞,∞) into the smaller intervals (−∞,−1),(−1,3)and(3,∞).(−∞,−1),(−1,3)and(3,∞).

 (−∞,−1),(−1,3)and(3,∞).(−∞,−1),(−1,3)and(3,∞).
_paragraph_91
 Step 2. Since f′f′ is a continuous function, to determine the sign of f′(x)f′(x) over each subinterval, it suffices to choose a point over each of the intervals (−∞,−1),(−1,3)and(3,∞)(−∞,−1),(−1,3)and(3,∞) and determine the sign of f′f′ at each of these points. For example, let’s choose x=−2,x=0,andx=4x=−2,x=0,andx=4 as test points.

 Step 1. The derivative is
_paragraph_119
 The derivative f′(x)=0f′(x)=0 when 1−x4/3=0.1−x4/3=0. Therefore, f′(x)=0f′(x)=0 at x=±1.x=±1. The derivative f′(x)f′(x) is undefined at x=0.x=0. Therefore, we have three critical points: x=0,x=0, x=1,x=1, and x=−1.x=−1. Consequently, divide the interval (−∞,∞)(−∞,∞) into the smaller intervals (−∞,−1),(−1,0),(0,1),(−∞,−1),(−1,0),(0,1), and (1,∞).(1,∞).

 Step 2: Since f′f′ is continuous over each subinterval, it suffices to choose a test point xx in each of the intervals from step 11 and determine the sign of f′f′ at each of these points. The points x=−2,x=−12,x=12,andx=2x=−2,x=−12,x=12,andx=2 are test points for these intervals.

Concavity and Points of Inflection,"_paragraph_1
 We now know how to determine where a function is increasing or decreasing. However, there is another issue to consider regarding the shape of the graph of a function. If the graph curves, does it curve upward or curve downward? This notion is called the concavity of the function.
_paragraph_2
 concavity
_paragraph_3
 Figure 4.34(a) shows a function ff with a graph that curves upward. As xx increases, the slope of the tangent line increases. Thus, since the derivative increases as xx increases, f′f′ is an increasing function. We say this function ff is concave up. Figure 4.34(b) shows a function ff that curves downward. As xx increases, the slope of the tangent line decreases. Since the derivative decreases as xx increases, f′f′ is a decreasing function. We say this function ff is concave down.

_paragraph_31
 In general, without having the graph of a function f,f, how can we determine its concavity? By definition, a function ff is concave up if f′f′ is increasing. From Corollary 3,3, we know that if f′f′ is a differentiable function, then f′f′ is increasing if its derivative f″(x)>0.f″(x)>0. Therefore, a function ff that is twice differentiable is concave up when f″(x)>0.f″(x)>0. Similarly, a function ff is concave down if f′f′ is decreasing. We know that a differentiable function f′f′ is decreasing if its derivative f″(x)<0.f″(x)<0. Therefore, a twice-differentiable function ff is concave down when f″(x)<0.f″(x)<0. Applying this logic is known as the concavity test.

 We conclude that we can determine the concavity of a function ff by looking at the second derivative of f.f. In addition, we observe that a function ff can switch concavity (Figure 4.35). However, a continuous function can switch concavity only at a point xx if f″(x)=0f″(x)=0 or f″(x)f″(x) is undefined. Consequently, to determine the intervals where a function ff is concave up and concave down, we look for those values of xx where f″(x)=0f″(x)=0 or f″(x)f″(x) is undefined. When we have determined these points, we divide the domain of ff into smaller intervals and determine the sign of f″f″ over each of these smaller intervals. If f″f″ changes sign as we pass through a point x,x, then ff changes concavity. It is important to remember that a function ff may not change concavity at a point xx even if f″(x)=0f″(x)=0 or f″(x)f″(x) is undefined. If, however, ff does change concavity at a point aa and ff is continuous at a,a, we say the point (a,f(a))(a,f(a)) is an inflection point of f.f.

 Since f″(x)>0f″(x)>0 for x<a,x<a, the function ff is concave up over the interval (−∞,a).(−∞,a). Since f″(x)<0f″(x)<0 for x>a,x>a, the function ff is concave down over the interval (a,∞).(a,∞). The point (a,f(a))(a,f(a)) is an inflection point of f.f.

 Solution
_paragraph_100
 To determine concavity, we need to find the second derivative f″(x).f″(x). The first derivative is f′(x)=3x2−12x+9,f′(x)=3x2−12x+9, so the second derivative is f″(x)=6x−12.f″(x)=6x−12. If the function changes concavity, it occurs either when f″(x)=0f″(x)=0 or f″(x)f″(x) is undefined. Since f″f″ is defined for all real numbers x,x, we need only find where f″(x)=0.f″(x)=0. Solving the equation 6x−12=0,6x−12=0, we see that x=2x=2 is the only place where ff could change concavity. We now test points over the intervals (−∞,2)(−∞,2) and (2,∞)(2,∞) to determine the concavity of f.f. The points x=0x=0 and x=3x=3 are test points for these intervals.

The Second Derivative Test,"_paragraph_1
 The first derivative test provides an analytical tool for finding local extrema, but the second derivative can also be used to locate extreme values. Using the second derivative can sometimes be a simpler method than using the first derivative.
_paragraph_2
 We know that if a continuous function has local extrema, it must occur at a critical point. However, a function need not have local extrema at a critical point. Here we examine how the second derivative test can be used to determine whether a function has a local extremum at a critical point. Let ff be a twice-differentiable function such that f′(a)=0f′(a)=0 and f″f″ is continuous over an open interval II containing a.a. Suppose f″(a)<0.f″(a)<0. Since f″f″ is continuous over I,I, f″(x)<0f″(x)<0 for all x∈Ix∈I (Figure 4.38). Then, by Corollary 3,3, f′f′ is a decreasing function over I.I. Since f′(a)=0,f′(a)=0, we conclude that for all x∈I,f′(x)>0x∈I,f′(x)>0 if x<ax<a and f′(x)<0f′(x)<0 if x>a.x>a. Therefore, by the first derivative test, ff has a local maximum at x=a.x=a. On the other hand, suppose there exists a point bb such that f′(b)=0f′(b)=0 but f″(b)>0.f″(b)>0. Since f″f″ is continuous over an open interval II containing b,b, then f″(x)>0f″(x)>0 for all x∈Ix∈I (Figure 4.38). Then, by Corollary 3,f′3,f′ is an increasing function over I.I. Since f′(b)=0,f′(b)=0, we conclude that for all x∈I,x∈I, f′(x)<0f′(x)<0 if x<bx<b and f′(x)>0f′(x)>0 if x>b.x>b. Therefore, by the first derivative test, ff has a local minimum at x=b.x=b.

 Consider a twice-differentiable function ff such that f″f″ is continuous. Since f′(a)=0f′(a)=0 and f″(a)<0,f″(a)<0, there is an interval II containing aa such that for all xx in I,I, ff is increasing if x<ax<a and ff is decreasing if x>a.x>a. As a result, ff has a local maximum at x=a.x=a. Since f′(b)=0f′(b)=0 and f″(b)>0,f″(b)>0, there is an interval II containing bb such that for all xx in I,I, ff is decreasing if x<bx<b and ff is increasing if x>b.x>b.

However, the function f(x)=x4f(x)=x4 has a local minimum at x=0x=0 whereas the function f(x)=−x4f(x)=−x4 has a local maximum at x,x, and the function f(x)=x3f(x)=x3 does not have a local extremum at x=0.x=0.

 In the following table, we evaluate the second derivative at each of the critical points and use the second derivative test to determine whether ff has a local maximum or local minimum at any of these points.

_paragraph_86
 By the second derivative test, we conclude that ff has a local maximum at x=−3x=−3 and ff has a local minimum at x=3.x=3. The second derivative test is inconclusive at x=0.x=0. To determine whether ff has local extrema at x=0,x=0, we apply the first derivative test. To evaluate the sign of f′(x)=5x2(x2−3)f′(x)=5x2(x2−3) for x∈(−3,0)x∈(−3,0) and x∈(0,3),x∈(0,3), let x=−1x=−1 and x=1x=1 be the two test points. Since f′(−1)<0f′(−1)<0 and f′(1)<0,f′(1)<0, we conclude that ff is decreasing on both intervals and, therefore, ff does not have local extrema at x=0x=0 as shown in the following graph.

Limits at Infinity,"_paragraph_1
 We begin by examining what it means for a function to have a finite limit at infinity. Then we study the idea of a function with an infinite limit at infinity. Back in Introduction to Functions and Graphs, we looked at vertical asymptotes; in this section we deal with horizontal and oblique asymptotes.
_paragraph_2
 Recall that limx→af(x)=Llimx→af(x)=L means f(x)f(x) becomes arbitrarily close to LL as long as xx is sufficiently close to a.a. We can extend this idea to limits at infinity. For example, consider the function f(x)=2+1x.f(x)=2+1x. As can be seen graphically in Figure 4.40 and numerically in Table 4.2, as the values of xx get larger, the values of f(x)f(x) approach 2.2. We say the limit as xx approaches ∞∞ of f(x)f(x) is 22 and write limx→∞f(x)=2.limx→∞f(x)=2. Similarly, for x<0,x<0, as the values |x||x| get larger, the values of f(x)f(x) approaches 2.2. We say the limit as xx approaches −∞−∞ of f(x)f(x) is 22 and write limx→-∞f(x)=2.limx→-∞f(x)=2.

 More generally, for any function f,f, we say the limit as x→∞x→∞ of f(x)f(x) is LL if f(x)f(x) becomes arbitrarily close to LL as long as xx is sufficiently large. In that case, we write limx→∞f(x)=L.limx→∞f(x)=L. Similarly, we say the limit as x→−∞x→−∞ of f(x)f(x) is LL if f(x)f(x) becomes arbitrarily close to LL as long as x<0x<0 and |x||x| is sufficiently large. In that case, we write limx→−∞f(x)=L.limx→−∞f(x)=L. We now look at the definition of a function having a limit at infinity.

 If the values f(x)f(x) are getting arbitrarily close to some finite value LL as x→∞x→∞ or x→−∞,x→−∞, the graph of ff approaches the line y=L.y=L. In that case, the line y=Ly=L is a horizontal asymptote of ff (Figure 4.41). For example, for the function f(x)=1x,f(x)=1x, since limx→∞f(x)=0,limx→∞f(x)=0, the line y=0y=0 is a horizontal asymptote of f(x)=1x.f(x)=1x.

 A function cannot cross a vertical asymptote because the graph must approach infinity (or −∞)−∞) from at least one direction as xx approaches the vertical asymptote. However, a function may cross a horizontal asymptote. In fact, a function may cross a horizontal asymptote an unlimited number of times. For example, the function f(x)=(cosx)x+1f(x)=(cosx)x+1 shown in Figure 4.42 intersects the horizontal asymptote y=1y=1 an infinite number of times as it oscillates around the asymptote with ever-decreasing amplitude.

 Sometimes the values of a function ff become arbitrarily large as x→∞x→∞ (or as x→−∞).x→−∞). In this case, we write limx→∞f(x)=∞limx→∞f(x)=∞ (or limx→−∞f(x)=∞).limx→−∞f(x)=∞). On the other hand, if the values of ff are negative but become arbitrarily large in magnitude as x→∞x→∞ (or as x→−∞),x→−∞), we write limx→∞f(x)=−∞limx→∞f(x)=−∞ (or limx→−∞f(x)=−∞).limx→−∞f(x)=−∞).

Limits at Infinity and Horizontal Asymptotes,"_paragraph_1
 Recall that limx→af(x)=Llimx→af(x)=L means f(x)f(x) becomes arbitrarily close to LL as long as xx is sufficiently close to a.a. We can extend this idea to limits at infinity. For example, consider the function f(x)=2+1x.f(x)=2+1x. As can be seen graphically in Figure 4.40 and numerically in Table 4.2, as the values of xx get larger, the values of f(x)f(x) approach 2.2. We say the limit as xx approaches ∞∞ of f(x)f(x) is 22 and write limx→∞f(x)=2.limx→∞f(x)=2. Similarly, for x<0,x<0, as the values |x||x| get larger, the values of f(x)f(x) approaches 2.2. We say the limit as xx approaches −∞−∞ of f(x)f(x) is 22 and write limx→-∞f(x)=2.limx→-∞f(x)=2.

In that case, we write limx→∞f(x)=L.limx→∞f(x)=L. Similarly, we say the limit as x→−∞x→−∞ of f(x)f(x) is LL if f(x)f(x) becomes arbitrarily close to LL as long as x<0x<0 and |x||x| is sufficiently large. In that case, we write limx→−∞f(x)=L.limx→−∞f(x)=L. We now look at the definition of a function having a limit at infinity.

 A function cannot cross a vertical asymptote because the graph must approach infinity (or −∞)−∞) from at least one direction as xx approaches the vertical asymptote. However, a function may cross a horizontal asymptote. In fact, a function may cross a horizontal asymptote an unlimited number of times. For example, the function f(x)=(cosx)x+1f(x)=(cosx)x+1 shown in Figure 4.42 intersects the horizontal asymptote y=1y=1 an infinite number of times as it oscillates around the asymptote with ever-decreasing amplitude.

Infinite Limits at Infinity,"_paragraph_1
 Sometimes the values of a function ff become arbitrarily large as x→∞x→∞ (or as x→−∞).x→−∞). In this case, we write limx→∞f(x)=∞limx→∞f(x)=∞ (or limx→−∞f(x)=∞).limx→−∞f(x)=∞). On the other hand, if the values of ff are negative but become arbitrarily large in magnitude as x→∞x→∞ (or as x→−∞),x→−∞), we write limx→∞f(x)=−∞limx→∞f(x)=−∞ (or limx→−∞f(x)=−∞).limx→−∞f(x)=−∞).

 Earlier, we used the terms arbitrarily close, arbitrarily large, and sufficiently large to define limits at infinity informally.

 The end behavior for rational functions and functions involving radicals is a little more complicated than for polynomials. In Example 4.25, we show that the limits at infinity of a rational function f(x)=p(x)q(x)f(x)=p(x)q(x) depend on the relationship between the degree of the numerator and the degree of the denominator. To evaluate the limits at infinity for a rational function, we divide the numerator and denominator by the highest power of xx appearing in the denominator. This determines which term in the overall expression dominates the behavior of the function at large values of x.x.

 Recall that for any base b>0,b≠1,b>0,b≠1, the function y=bxy=bx is an exponential function with domain (−∞,∞)(−∞,∞) and range (0,∞).(0,∞). If b>1,y=bxb>1,y=bx is increasing over `(−∞,∞).`(−∞,∞). If 0<b<1,0<b<1, y=bxy=bx is decreasing over (−∞,∞).(−∞,∞). For the natural exponential function f(x)=ex,f(x)=ex, e≈2.718>1.e≈2.718>1. Therefore, f(x)=exf(x)=ex is increasing on `(−∞,∞)`(−∞,∞) and the range is `(0,∞).`(0,∞).

End Behavior for Algebraic Functions,"_paragraph_1
 The end behavior for rational functions and functions involving radicals is a little more complicated than for polynomials. In Example 4.25, we show that the limits at infinity of a rational function f(x)=p(x)q(x)f(x)=p(x)q(x) depend on the relationship between the degree of the numerator and the degree of the denominator. To evaluate the limits at infinity for a rational function, we divide the numerator and denominator by the highest power of xx appearing in the denominator. This determines which term in the overall expression dominates the behavior of the function at large values of x.x.

Although ff is certainly not a linear function, we now investigate why the graph of ff seems to be approaching a linear function. First, using long division of polynomials, we can write

 Recall that for any base b>0,b≠1,b>0,b≠1, the function y=bxy=bx is an exponential function with domain (−∞,∞)(−∞,∞) and range (0,∞).(0,∞). If b>1,y=bxb>1,y=bx is increasing over `(−∞,∞).`(−∞,∞).

Guidelines for Drawing the Graph of a Function,"_paragraph_1
 We now have enough analytical tools to draw graphs of a wide variety of algebraic and transcendental functions. Before showing how to graph specific functions, let’s look at a general strategy to use when graphing any function.
_paragraph_2
 Problem-Solving Strategy
_paragraph_3
 Problem-Solving Strategy: Drawing the Graph of a Function
_paragraph_4
 Given a function f,f, use the following steps to sketch a graph of f:f:
_paragraph_5
 f,f,
_paragraph_6
 f:f:
_paragraph_7
 Now let’s use this strategy to graph several different functions. We start by graphing a polynomial function.
_paragraph_8
 Example
_paragraph_9
 4.28
_paragraph_10
 Sketch a graph of f(x)=(x−1)2(x+2).f(x)=(x−1)2(x+2).
_paragraph_11
 f(x)=(x−1)2(x+2).f(x)=(x−1)2(x+2).
_paragraph_12
 Solution
_paragraph_13
 Step 1. Since ff is a polynomial, the domain is the set of all real numbers.
_paragraph_14
 ff
_paragraph_15
 Step 2. When x=0,f(x)=2.x=0,f(x)=2. Therefore, the yy-intercept is (0,2).(0,2). To find the xx-intercepts, we need to solve the equation (x−1)2(x+2)=0,(x−1)2(x+2)=0, gives us the xx-intercepts (1,0)(1,0) and (−2,0)(−2,0)
_paragraph_16

_paragraph_21
 xx
_paragraph_22
 (1,0)(1,0)
_paragraph_23
 (−2,0)(−2,0)
_paragraph_24
 Step 3. We need to evaluate the end behavior of f.f. As x→∞,x→∞, (x−1)2→∞(x−1)2→∞ and (x+2)→∞.(x+2)→∞. Therefore, limx→∞f(x)=∞.limx→∞f(x)=∞. As x→−∞,x→−∞, (x−1)2→∞(x−1)2→∞ and (x+2)→−∞.(x+2)→−∞. Therefore, limx→−∞f(x)=−∞.limx→−∞f(x)=−∞. To get even more information about the end behavior of f,f, we can multiply the factors of f.f. When doing so, we see that
_paragraph_25
 f.f.
_paragraph_26
 x→∞,x→∞,
_paragraph_27

 Since the leading term of ff is x3,x3, we conclude that ff behaves like y=x3y=x3 as x→±∞.x→±∞.

_paragraph_42
 Step 4. Since ff is a polynomial function, it does not have any vertical asymptotes.
_paragraph_43
 ff
_paragraph_44
 Step 5. The first derivative of ff is
_paragraph_45
 ff
_paragraph_46
 Therefore, ff has two critical points: x=1,−1.x=1,−1. Divide the interval (−∞,∞)(−∞,∞) into the three smaller intervals: (−∞,−1),(−∞,−1), (−1,1),(−1,1), and (1,∞).(1,∞). Then, choose test points x=−2,x=−2, x=0,x=0, and x=2x=2 from these intervals and evaluate the sign of f′(x)f′(x) at each of these test points, as shown in the following table.

 From the table, we see that ff has a local maximum at x=−1x=−1 and a local minimum at x=1.x=1. Evaluating f(x)f(x) at those two points, we find that the local maximum value is f(−1)=4f(−1)=4 and the local minimum value is f(1)=0.f(1)=0.

_paragraph_64
 Step 6. The second derivative of ff is
_paragraph_65
 ff
_paragraph_66
 The second derivative is zero at x=0.x=0. Therefore, to determine the concavity of f,f, divide the interval (−∞,∞)(−∞,∞) into the smaller intervals (−∞,0)(−∞,0) and (0,∞),(0,∞), and choose test points x=−1x=−1 and x=1x=1 to determine the concavity of ff on each of these smaller intervals as shown in the following table.

 We note that the information in the preceding table confirms the fact, found in step 5,5, that ff has a local maximum at x=−1x=−1 and a local minimum at x=1.x=1. In addition, the information found in step 55—namely, ff has a local maximum at x=−1x=−1 and a local minimum at x=1,x=1, and f′(x)=0f′(x)=0 at those points—combined with the fact that f″f″ changes sign only at x=0x=0 confirms the results found in step 66 on the concavity of f.f.

_paragraph_99
 Solution
_paragraph_100
 Step 1. The function ff is defined as long as the denominator is not zero. Therefore, the domain is the set of all real numbers xx except x=±1.x=±1.

_paragraph_103
 x=±1.x=±1.
_paragraph_104
 Step 2. Find the intercepts. If x=0,x=0, then f(x)=0,f(x)=0, so 00 is an intercept. If y=0,y=0, then x2(1−x2)=0,x2(1−x2)=0, which implies x=0.x=0. Therefore, (0,0)(0,0) is the only intercept.

_paragraph_110
 x=0.x=0.
_paragraph_111
 (0,0)(0,0)
_paragraph_112
 Step 3. Evaluate the limits at infinity. Since ff is a rational function, divide the numerator and denominator by the highest power in the denominator: x2.x2. We obtain
_paragraph_113
 ff
_paragraph_114
 x2.x2.
_paragraph_115
 Therefore, ff has a horizontal asymptote of y=−1y=−1 as x→∞x→∞ and x→−∞.x→−∞.

 y=−1y=−1
_paragraph_118
 x→∞x→∞
_paragraph_119
 x→−∞.x→−∞.
_paragraph_120
 Step 4. To determine whether ff has any vertical asymptotes, first check to see whether the denominator has any zeroes. We find the denominator is zero when x=±1.x=±1. To determine whether the lines x=1x=1 or x=−1x=−1 are vertical asymptotes of f,f, evaluate limx→1f(x)limx→1f(x) and limx→−1f(x).limx→−1f(x). By looking at each one-sided limit as x→1,x→1, we see that
_paragraph_121

 x=±1.x=±1.

_paragraph_127
 limx→−1f(x).limx→−1f(x).

 x→1,x→1,
_paragraph_129
 In addition, by looking at each one-sided limit as x→−1,x→−1, we find that
_paragraph_130
 x→−1,x→−1,
_paragraph_131
 Step 5. Calculate the first derivative:
_paragraph_132
 Critical points occur at points xx where f′(x)=0f′(x)=0 or f′(x)f′(x) is undefined. We see that f′(x)=0f′(x)=0 when x=0.x=0. The derivative f′f′ is not undefined at any point in the domain of f.f. However, x=±1x=±1 are not in the domain of f.f. Therefore, to determine where ff is increasing and where ff is decreasing, divide the interval (−∞,∞)(−∞,∞) into four smaller intervals: (−∞,−1),(−∞,−1), (−1,0),(−1,0), (0,1),(0,1), and (1,∞),(1,∞), and choose a test point in each interval to determine the sign of f′(x)f′(x) in each of these intervals. The values x=−2,x=−2, x=−12,x=−12, x=12,x=12, and x=2x=2 are good choices for test points as shown in the following table.

 From this analysis, we conclude that ff has a local minimum at x=0x=0 but no local maximum.
_paragraph_155

 x=0x=0
_paragraph_157
 Step 6. Calculate the second derivative:
_paragraph_158
 To determine the intervals where ff is concave up and where ff is concave down, we first need to find all points xx where f″(x)=0f″(x)=0 or f″(x)f″(x) is undefined. Since the numerator 6x2+2≠06x2+2≠0 for any x,x, f″(x)f″(x) is never zero. Furthermore, f″f″ is not undefined for any xx in the domain of f.f. However, as discussed earlier, x=±1x=±1 are not in the domain of f.f. Therefore, to determine the concavity of f,f, we divide the interval (−∞,∞)(−∞,∞) into the three smaller intervals (−∞,−1),(−∞,−1), (−1,−1),(−1,−1), and (1,∞),(1,∞), and choose a test point in each of these intervals to evaluate the sign of f″(x).f″(x). in each of these intervals. The values x=−2,x=−2, x=0,x=0, and x=2x=2 are possible test points as shown in the following table.

 Combining all this information, we arrive at the graph of ff shown below. Note that, although ff changes concavity at x=−1x=−1 and x=1,x=1, there are no inflection points at either of these places because ff is not continuous at x=−1x=−1 or x=1.x=1.

 Solution

 Step 1. The domain of ff is the set of all real numbers xx except x=1.x=1.

_paragraph_200

_paragraph_201
 x=1.x=1.
_paragraph_202
 Step 2. Find the intercepts. We can see that when x=0,x=0, f(x)=0,f(x)=0, so (0,0)(0,0) is the only intercept.
_paragraph_203
 x=0,x=0,
_paragraph_204
 f(x)=0,f(x)=0,
_paragraph_205
 (0,0)(0,0)
_paragraph_206
 Step 3. Evaluate the limits at infinity. Since the degree of the numerator is one more than the degree of the denominator, ff must have an oblique asymptote. To find the oblique asymptote, use long division of polynomials to write
_paragraph_207
 ff
_paragraph_208
 Since 1/(x−1)→01/(x−1)→0 as x→±∞,x→±∞, f(x)f(x) approaches the line y=x+1y=x+1 as x→±∞.x→±∞. The line y=x+1y=x+1 is an oblique asymptote for f.f.
_paragraph_209

 f.f.
_paragraph_216
 Step 4. To check for vertical asymptotes, look at where the denominator is zero. Here the denominator is zero at x=1.x=1. Looking at both one-sided limits as x→1,x→1, we find
_paragraph_217
 x=1.x=1.
_paragraph_218
 x→1,x→1,
_paragraph_219
 Therefore, x=1x=1 is a vertical asymptote, and we have determined the behavior of ff as xx approaches 11 from the right and the left.
_paragraph_220
 x=1x=1
_paragraph_221
 ff
_paragraph_222

 Step 5. Calculate the first derivative:
_paragraph_225
 We have f′(x)=0f′(x)=0 when x2−2x=x(x−2)=0.x2−2x=x(x−2)=0. Therefore, x=0x=0 and x=2x=2 are critical points. Since ff is undefined at x=1,x=1, we need to divide the interval (−∞,∞)(−∞,∞) into the smaller intervals (−∞,0),(−∞,0), (0,1),(0,1), (1,2),(1,2), and (2,∞),(2,∞), and choose a test point from each interval to evaluate the sign of f′(x)f′(x) in each of these smaller intervals. For example, let x=−1,x=−1, x=12,x=12, x=32,x=32, and x=3x=3 be the test points as shown in the following table.
_paragraph_226
 f′(x)=0f′(x)=0

_paragraph_242
 From this table, we see that ff has a local maximum at x=0x=0 and a local minimum at x=2.x=2. The value of ff at the local maximum is f(0)=0f(0)=0 and the value of ff at the local minimum is f(2)=4.f(2)=4. Therefore, (0,0)(0,0) and (2,4)(2,4) are important points on the graph.

 Step 6. Calculate the second derivative:
_paragraph_253
 We see that f″(x)f″(x) is never zero or undefined for xx in the domain of f.f. Since ff is undefined at x=1,x=1, to check concavity we just divide the interval (−∞,∞)(−∞,∞) into the two smaller intervals (−∞,1)(−∞,1) and (1,∞),(1,∞), and choose a test point from each interval to evaluate the sign of f″(x)f″(x) in each of these intervals.

_paragraph_275
 Solution
_paragraph_276
 Step 1. Since the cube-root function is defined for all real numbers xx and (x−1)2/3=(x−13)2,(x−1)2/3=(x−13)2, the domain of ff is all real numbers.
_paragraph_277

_paragraph_278
 (x−1)2/3=(x−13)2,(x−1)2/3=(x−13)2,

_paragraph_280
 Step 2: To find the yy-intercept, evaluate f(0).f(0). Since f(0)=1,f(0)=1, the yy-intercept is (0,1).(0,1). To find the xx-intercept, solve (x−1)2/3=0.(x−1)2/3=0. The solution of this equation is x=1,x=1, so the xx-intercept is (1,0).(1,0).

_paragraph_291
 Step 3: Since limx→±∞(x−1)2/3=∞,limx→±∞(x−1)2/3=∞, the function continues to grow without bound as x→∞x→∞ and x→−∞.x→−∞.
_paragraph_292
 limx→±∞(x−1)2/3=∞,limx→±∞(x−1)2/3=∞,
_paragraph_293
 x→∞x→∞
_paragraph_294
 x→−∞.x→−∞.
_paragraph_295
 Step 4: The function has no vertical asymptotes.
_paragraph_296
 Step 5: To determine where ff is increasing or decreasing, calculate f′.f′. We find
_paragraph_297
 ff
_paragraph_298
 f′.f′.
_paragraph_299
 This function is not zero anywhere, but it is undefined when x=1.x=1. Therefore, the only critical point is x=1.x=1. Divide the interval (−∞,∞)(−∞,∞) into the smaller intervals (−∞,1)(−∞,1) and (1,∞),(1,∞), and choose test points in each of these intervals to determine the sign of f′(x)f′(x) in each of these smaller intervals. Let x=0x=0 and x=2x=2 be the test points as shown in the following table.

 x=1.x=1.

 We conclude that ff has a local minimum at x=1.x=1. Evaluating ff at x=1,x=1, we find that the value of ff at the local minimum is zero. Note that f′(1)f′(1) is undefined, so to determine the behavior of the function at this critical point, we need to examine limx→1f′(x).limx→1f′(x). Looking at the one-sided limits, we have
_paragraph_309

 x=1.x=1.

_paragraph_321
 We find that f″(x)f″(x) is defined for all x,x, but is undefined when x=1.x=1. Therefore, divide the interval (−∞,∞)(−∞,∞) into the smaller intervals (−∞,1)(−∞,1) and (1,∞),(1,∞), and choose test points to evaluate the sign of f″(x)f″(x) in each of these intervals.

"Solving Optimization Problems over a Closed, Bounded Interval","_paragraph_1
 The basic idea of the optimization problems that follow is the same. We have a particular quantity that we are interested in maximizing or minimizing. However, we also have some auxiliary condition that needs to be satisfied. For example, in Example 4.32, we are interested in maximizing the area of a rectangular garden. Certainly, if we keep making the side lengths of the garden larger, the area will continue to become larger. However, what if we have some restriction on how much fencing we can use for the perimeter? In this case, we cannot make the garden as large as we like. Let’s look at how we can maximize the area of a rectangle subject to some constraint on the perimeter.
_paragraph_2
 optimization problems
_paragraph_3
 Example
_paragraph_4
 4.32
_paragraph_5
 A rectangular garden is to be constructed using a rock wall as one side of the garden and wire fencing for the other three sides (Figure 4.62). Given 100100 ft of wire fencing, determine the dimensions that would create a garden of maximum area. What is the maximum area?

_paragraph_7
 Figure
_paragraph_8
 4.62
_paragraph_9
 We want to determine the measurements xx and yy that will create a garden with a maximum area using 100100 ft of fencing.
_paragraph_10
 Solution
_paragraph_11
 Let xx denote the length of the side of the garden perpendicular to the rock wall and yy denote the length of the side parallel to the rock wall. Then the area of the garden is
_paragraph_12
 xx
_paragraph_13
 yy
_paragraph_14
 We want to find the maximum possible area subject to the constraint that the total fencing is 100ft.100ft. From Figure 4.62, the total amount of fencing used will be 2x+y.2x+y. Therefore, the constraint equation is
_paragraph_15
 100ft.100ft.
_paragraph_16
 2x+y.2x+y.
_paragraph_17
 Solving this equation for y,y, we have y=100−2x.y=100−2x. Thus, we can write the area as
_paragraph_18
 y,y,
_paragraph_19

 Before trying to maximize the area function A(x)=100x−2x2,A(x)=100x−2x2, we need to determine the domain under consideration. To construct a rectangular garden, we certainly need the lengths of both sides to be positive. Therefore, we need x>0x>0 and y>0.y>0. Since y=100−2x,y=100−2x, if y>0,y>0, then x<50.x<50. Therefore, we are trying to determine the maximum value of A(x)A(x) for xx over the open interval (0,50).(0,50). We do not know that a function necessarily has a maximum value over an open interval. However, we do know that a continuous function has an absolute maximum (and absolute minimum) over a closed interval. Therefore, let’s consider the function A(x)=100x−2x2A(x)=100x−2x2 over the closed interval [0,50].[0,50]. If the maximum value occurs at an interior point, then we have found the value xx in the open interval (0,50)(0,50) that maximizes the area of the garden. Therefore, we consider the following problem:
_paragraph_21
 A(x)=100x−2x2,A(x)=100x−2x2,
_paragraph_22
 x>0x>0
_paragraph_23

 As mentioned earlier, since AA is a continuous function on a closed, bounded interval, by the extreme value theorem, it has a maximum and a minimum. These extreme values occur either at endpoints or critical points. At the endpoints, A(x)=0.A(x)=0. Since the area is positive for all xx in the open interval (0,50),(0,50), the maximum must occur at a critical point. Differentiating the function A(x),A(x), we obtain

 Therefore, the only critical point is x=25x=25 (Figure 4.63). We conclude that the maximum area must occur when x=25.x=25. Then we have y=100−2x=100−2(25)=50.y=100−2x=100−2(25)=50. To maximize the area of the garden, let x=25x=25 ft and y=50ft.y=50ft. The area of this garden is 1250ft2.1250ft2.

 Now let’s apply this strategy to maximize the volume of an open-top box given a constraint on the amount of material to be used.

 An open-top box is to be made from a 2424 in. by 3636 in. piece of cardboard by removing a square from each corner of the box and folding up the flaps on each side. What size square should be cut out of each corner to get a box with the maximum volume?

 A square with side length xx inches is removed from each corner of the piece of cardboard. The remaining flaps are folded to form an open-top box.
_paragraph_73
 Step 2: We are trying to maximize the volume of a box. Therefore, the problem is to maximize V.V.
_paragraph_74
 V.V.
_paragraph_75
 Step 3: As mentioned in step 2,2, we are trying to maximize the volume of a box. The volume of a box is V=L·W·H,V=L·W·H, where L,W,andHL,W,andH are the length, width, and height, respectively.

_paragraph_77
 V=L·W·H,V=L·W·H,
_paragraph_78

_paragraph_79
 Step 4: From Figure 4.64, we see that the height of the box is xx inches, the length is 36−2x36−2x inches, and the width is 24−2x24−2x inches. Therefore, the volume of the box is
_paragraph_80
 xx
_paragraph_81
 36−2x36−2x
_paragraph_82
 24−2x24−2x
_paragraph_83
 Step 5: To determine the domain of consideration, let’s examine Figure 4.64. Certainly, we need x>0.x>0. Furthermore, the side length of the square cannot be greater than or equal to half the length of the shorter side, 2424 in.; otherwise, one of the flaps would be completely cut off. Therefore, we are trying to determine whether there is a maximum volume of the box for xx over the open interval (0,12).(0,12). Since VV is a continuous function over the closed interval [0,12],[0,12], we know VV will have an absolute maximum over the closed interval. Therefore, we consider VV over the closed interval [0,12][0,12] and check whether the absolute maximum occurs at an interior point.

 Step 6: Since V(x)V(x) is a continuous function over the closed, bounded interval [0,12],[0,12], VV must have an absolute maximum (and an absolute minimum). Since V(x)=0V(x)=0 at the endpoints and V(x)>0V(x)>0 for 0<x<12,0<x<12, the maximum must occur at a critical point. The derivative is

 Using the quadratic formula, we find that the critical points are
_paragraph_104
 Since 10+2710+27 is not in the domain of consideration, the only critical point we need to consider is 10−27.10−27. Therefore, the volume is maximized if we let x=10−27in.x=10−27in. The maximum volume is V(10−27)=640+4487≈1825in.3V(10−27)=640+4487≈1825in.3 as shown in the following graph.

The visitor is planning to go from the cabin to the island. Suppose the visitor runs at a rate of 8mph8mph and swims at a rate of 3mph.3mph.

_paragraph_137
 Step 3: To find the time spent traveling from the cabin to the island, add the time spent running and the time spent swimming. Since Distance == Rate ×× Time (D=R×T),(D=R×T), the time spent running is

 and the time spent swimming is
_paragraph_142
 Therefore, the total time spent traveling is
_paragraph_143
 Step 4: From Figure 4.66, the line segment of yy miles forms the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs of length 2mi2mi and 6−xmi.6−xmi. Therefore, by the Pythagorean theorem, 22+(6−x)2=y2,22+(6−x)2=y2, and we obtain y=(6−x)2+4.y=(6−x)2+4. Thus, the total time spent traveling is given by the function

 y=(6−x)2+4.y=(6−x)2+4.
_paragraph_149
 Step 5: From Figure 4.66, we see that 0≤x≤6.0≤x≤6. Therefore, [0,6][0,6] is the domain of consideration.
_paragraph_150
 0≤x≤6.0≤x≤6.
_paragraph_151
 [0,6][0,6]
_paragraph_152
 Step 6: Since T(x)T(x) is a continuous function over a closed, bounded interval, it has a maximum and a minimum. Let’s begin by looking for any critical points of TT over the interval [0,6].[0,6]. The derivative is

_paragraph_167
 Therefore, the possibilities for critical points are
_paragraph_168
 Since x=6+6/55x=6+6/55 is not in the domain, it is not a possibility for a critical point. On the other hand, x=6−6/55x=6−6/55 is in the domain. Since we squared both sides of Equation 4.6 to arrive at the possible critical points, it remains to verify that x=6−6/55x=6−6/55 satisfies Equation 4.6. Since x=6−6/55x=6−6/55 does satisfy that equation, we conclude that x=6−6/55x=6−6/55 is a critical point, and it is the only one. To justify that the time is minimized for this value of x,x, we just need to check the values of T(x)T(x) at the endpoints x=0x=0 and x=6,x=6, and compare them with the value of T(x)T(x) at the critical point x=6−6/55.x=6−6/55. We find that T(0)≈2.108hT(0)≈2.108h and T(6)≈1.417h,T(6)≈1.417h, whereas T(6−6/55)≈1.368h.T(6−6/55)≈1.368h. Therefore, we conclude that TT has a local minimum at x≈5.19x≈5.19 mi.

If they charge $50$50 per day or less, they will rent all their cars. If they charge $200$200 per day or more, they will not rent any cars. Assuming the owners plan to charge customers between $50 per day and $200$200 per day to rent a car, how much should they charge to maximize their revenue?

 R=n×p.R=n×p.
_paragraph_214
 Step 4: Since the number of cars rented per day is modeled by the linear function n(p)=1000−5p,n(p)=1000−5p, the revenue RR can be represented by the function

 n(p)=1000−5p,n(p)=1000−5p,

 Step 5: Since the owners plan to charge between $50$50 per car per day and $200$200 per car per day, the problem is to find the maximum revenue R(p)R(p) for pp in the closed interval [50,200].[50,200].

 Step 6: Since RR is a continuous function over the closed, bounded interval [50,200],[50,200], it has an absolute maximum (and an absolute minimum) in that interval. To find the maximum value, look for critical points. The derivative is R′(p)=−10p+1000.R′(p)=−10p+1000. Therefore, the critical point is p=100p=100 When p=100,p=100, R(100)=$50,000.R(100)=$50,000. When p=50,p=50, R(p)=$37,500.R(p)=$37,500. When p=200,p=200, R(p)=$0.R(p)=$0. Therefore, the absolute maximum occurs at p=$100.p=$100.

 Step 5: From Figure 4.68, we see that to inscribe a rectangle in the ellipse, the xx-coordinate of the corner in the first quadrant must satisfy 0<x<2.0<x<2. Therefore, the problem reduces to looking for the maximum value of A(x)A(x) over the open interval (0,2).(0,2). Since A(x)A(x) will have an absolute maximum (and absolute minimum) over the closed interval [0,2],[0,2], we consider A(x)=2x4−x2A(x)=2x4−x2 over the interval [0,2].[0,2]. If the absolute maximum occurs at an interior point, then we have found an absolute maximum in the open interval.

At the endpoints x=0x=0 and x=2,x=2, A(x)=0.A(x)=0. For 0<x<2,0<x<2, A(x)>0.A(x)>0. Therefore, the maximum must occur at a critical point. Taking the derivative of A(x),A(x), we obtain

Since x=2x=2 is a solution of Equation 4.7, we conclude that 22 is the only critical point of A(x)A(x) in the interval [0,2].[0,2].

 We want to find the maximum possible area subject to the constraint that the total fencing is 100ft.100ft. From Figure 4.62, the total amount of fencing used will be 2x+y.2x+y. Therefore, the constraint equation is
_paragraph_6
 100ft.100ft.
_paragraph_7
 2x+y.2x+y.
_paragraph_8
 Solving this equation for y,y, we have y=100−2x.y=100−2x. Thus, we can write the area as
_paragraph_9
 y,y,
_paragraph_10
 y=100−2x.y=100−2x.
_paragraph_11
 Before trying to maximize the area function A(x)=100x−2x2,A(x)=100x−2x2, we need to determine the domain under consideration. To construct a rectangular garden, we certainly need the lengths of both sides to be positive. Therefore, we need x>0x>0 and y>0.y>0. Since y=100−2x,y=100−2x, if y>0,y>0, then x<50.x<50. Therefore, we are trying to determine the maximum value of A(x)A(x) for xx over the open interval (0,50).(0,50). We do not know that a function necessarily has a maximum value over an open interval. However, we do know that a continuous function has an absolute maximum (and absolute minimum) over a closed interval. Therefore, let’s consider the function A(x)=100x−2x2A(x)=100x−2x2 over the closed interval [0,50].[0,50]. If the maximum value occurs at an interior point, then we have found the value xx in the open interval (0,50)(0,50) that maximizes the area of the garden. Therefore, we consider the following problem:
_paragraph_12
 A(x)=100x−2x2,A(x)=100x−2x2,

 As mentioned earlier, since AA is a continuous function on a closed, bounded interval, by the extreme value theorem, it has a maximum and a minimum. These extreme values occur either at endpoints or critical points. At the endpoints, A(x)=0.A(x)=0. Since the area is positive for all xx in the open interval (0,50),(0,50), the maximum must occur at a critical point. Differentiating the function A(x),A(x), we obtain

Solving Optimization Problems when the Interval Is Not Closed or Is Unbounded,"_paragraph_1
 In the previous examples, we considered functions on closed, bounded domains. Consequently, by the extreme value theorem, we were guaranteed that the functions had absolute extrema. Let’s now consider functions for which the domain is neither closed nor bounded.
_paragraph_2
 Many functions still have at least one absolute extrema, even if the domain is not closed or the domain is unbounded. For example, the function f(x)=x2+4f(x)=x2+4 over (−∞,∞)(−∞,∞) has an absolute minimum of 44 at x=0.x=0. Therefore, we can still consider functions over unbounded domains or open intervals and determine whether they have any absolute extrema. In the next example, we try to minimize a function over an unbounded domain. We will see that, although the domain of consideration is (0,∞),(0,∞), the function has an absolute minimum.

 In the following example, we look at constructing a box of least surface area with a prescribed volume. It is not difficult to show that for a closed-top box, by symmetry, among all boxes with a specified volume, a cube will have the smallest surface area. Consequently, we consider the modified problem of determining which open-topped box with a specified volume has the smallest surface area.

_paragraph_12
 216216
_paragraph_13
 Solution

 We want to minimize the surface area of a square-based box with a given volume.
_paragraph_21
 Step 2: We need to minimize the surface area. Therefore, we need to minimize S.S.
_paragraph_22
 S.S.
_paragraph_23
 Step 3: Since the box has an open top, we need only determine the area of the four vertical sides and the base. The area of each of the four vertical sides is x·y.x·y. The area of the base is x2.x2. Therefore, the surface area of the box is
_paragraph_24
 x·y.x·y.
_paragraph_25
 x2.x2.
_paragraph_26
 Step 4: Since the volume of this box is x2yx2y and the volume is given as 216in.3,216in.3, the constraint equation is
_paragraph_27
 x2yx2y
_paragraph_28
 216in.3,216in.3,
_paragraph_29
 Solving the constraint equation for y,y, we have y=216x2.y=216x2. Therefore, we can write the surface area as a function of xx only:
_paragraph_30
 y,y,
_paragraph_31
 y=216x2.y=216x2.
_paragraph_32
 xx
_paragraph_33
 Therefore, S(x)=864x+x2.S(x)=864x+x2.
_paragraph_34
 S(x)=864x+x2.S(x)=864x+x2.
_paragraph_35
 Step 5: Since we are requiring that x2y=216,x2y=216, we cannot have x=0.x=0. Therefore, we need x>0.x>0. On the other hand, xx is allowed to have any positive value. Note that as xx becomes large, the height of the box yy becomes correspondingly small so that x2y=216.x2y=216. Similarly, as xx becomes small, the height of the box becomes correspondingly large. We conclude that the domain is the open, unbounded interval (0,∞).(0,∞). Note that, unlike the previous examples, we cannot reduce our problem to looking for an absolute maximum or absolute minimum over a closed, bounded interval. However, in the next step, we discover why this function must have an absolute minimum over the interval (0,∞).(0,∞).

_paragraph_46
 Step 6: Note that as x→0+,x→0+, S(x)→∞.S(x)→∞. Also, as x→∞,x→∞, S(x)→∞.S(x)→∞. Since SS is a continuous function that approaches infinity at the ends, it must have an absolute minimum at some x∈(0,∞).x∈(0,∞). This minimum must occur at a critical point of S.S. The derivative is
_paragraph_47
 x→0+,x→0+,
_paragraph_48
 S(x)→∞.S(x)→∞.

 Therefore, S′(x)=0S′(x)=0 when 2x=864x2.2x=864x2. Solving this equation for x,x, we obtain x3=432,x3=432, so x=4323=623.x=4323=623. Since this is the only critical point of S,S, the absolute minimum must occur at x=623x=623 (see Figure 4.70). When x=623,x=623, y=216(623)2=323in.y=216(623)2=323in. Therefore, the dimensions of the box should be x=623in.x=623in. and y=323in.y=323in. With these dimensions, the surface area is

Applying L’Hôpital’s Rule,"_paragraph_1
 L’Hôpital’s rule can be used to evaluate limits involving the quotient of two functions. Consider
_paragraph_2
 If limx→af(x)=L1andlimx→ag(x)=L2≠0,limx→af(x)=L1andlimx→ag(x)=L2≠0, then
_paragraph_3
 limx→af(x)=L1andlimx→ag(x)=L2≠0,limx→af(x)=L1andlimx→ag(x)=L2≠0,
_paragraph_4
 However, what happens if limx→af(x)=0limx→af(x)=0 and limx→ag(x)=0?limx→ag(x)=0? We call this one of the indeterminate forms, of type 00.00. This is considered an indeterminate form because we cannot determine the exact behavior of f(x)g(x)f(x)g(x) as x→ax→a without further analysis. We have seen examples of this earlier in the text. For example, consider
_paragraph_5
 limx→af(x)=0limx→af(x)=0
_paragraph_6
 limx→ag(x)=0?limx→ag(x)=0?
_paragraph_7
 indeterminate forms
_paragraph_8
 00.00.
_paragraph_9
 f(x)g(x)f(x)g(x)
_paragraph_10
 x→ax→a
_paragraph_11
 For the first of these examples, we can evaluate the limit by factoring the numerator and writing
_paragraph_12
 For limx→0sinxxlimx→0sinxx we were able to show, using a geometric argument, that
_paragraph_13
 limx→0sinxxlimx→0sinxx
_paragraph_14
 Here we use a different technique for evaluating limits such as these. Not only does this technique provide an easier way to evaluate these limits, but also, and more important, it provides us with a way to evaluate many other limits that we could not calculate previously.
_paragraph_15
 The idea behind L’Hôpital’s rule can be explained using local linear approximations. Consider two differentiable functions ff and gg such that limx→af(x)=0=limx→ag(x)limx→af(x)=0=limx→ag(x) and such that g′(a)≠0g′(a)≠0 For xx near a,a, we can write

 If limx→af(x)=limx→ag(x),limx→af(x)=limx→ag(x), then the ratio f(x)/g(x)f(x)/g(x) is approximately equal to the ratio of their linear approximations near a.a.
_paragraph_27
 Since ff is differentiable at a,a, then ff is continuous at a,a, and therefore f(a)=limx→af(x)=0.f(a)=limx→af(x)=0. Similarly, g(a)=limx→ag(x)=0.g(a)=limx→ag(x)=0. If we also assume that f′f′ and g′g′ are continuous at x=a,x=a, then f′(a)=limx→af′(x)f′(a)=limx→af′(x) and g′(a)=limx→ag′(x).g′(a)=limx→ag′(x). Using these ideas, we conclude that

 Note that the assumption that f′f′ and g′g′ are continuous at aa and g′(a)≠0g′(a)≠0 can be loosened. We state L’Hôpital’s rule formally for the indeterminate form 00.00. Also note that the notation 0000 does not mean we are actually dividing zero by zero. Rather, we are using the notation 0000 to represent a quotient of limits, each of which is zero.

 As mentioned, L’Hôpital’s rule is an extremely useful tool for evaluating limits. It is important to remember, however, that to apply L’Hôpital’s rule to a quotient f(x)g(x),f(x)g(x), it is essential that the limit of f(x)g(x)f(x)g(x) be of the form 0000 or ∞/∞.∞/∞. Consider the following example.

 L’Hôpital’s rule is very useful for evaluating limits involving the indeterminate forms 0000 and ∞/∞.∞/∞. However, we can also use L’Hôpital’s rule to help evaluate limits involving other indeterminate forms that arise when evaluating limits. The expressions 0·∞,0·∞, ∞−∞,∞−∞, 1∞,1∞, ∞0,∞0, and 0000 are all considered indeterminate forms. These expressions are not real numbers. Rather, they represent forms that arise when trying to evaluate certain limits. Next we realize why these are indeterminate forms and then understand how to use L’Hôpital’s rule in these cases. The key idea is that we must rewrite the indeterminate forms in such a way that we arrive at the indeterminate form 0000 or ∞/∞.∞/∞.

 Suppose we want to evaluate limx→a(f(x)·g(x)),limx→a(f(x)·g(x)), where f(x)→0f(x)→0 and g(x)→∞g(x)→∞ (or −∞)−∞) as x→a.x→a. Since one term in the product is approaching zero but the other term is becoming arbitrarily large (in magnitude), anything can happen to the product. We use the notation 0·∞0·∞ to denote the form that arises in this situation. The expression 0·∞0·∞ is considered indeterminate because we cannot determine without further analysis the exact behavior of the product f(x)g(x)f(x)g(x) as x→a.x→a. For example, let nn be a positive integer and consider

 Another type of indeterminate form is ∞−∞.∞−∞. Consider the following example. Let nn be a positive integer and let f(x)=3xnf(x)=3xn and g(x)=3x2+5.g(x)=3x2+5. As x→∞,x→∞, f(x)→∞f(x)→∞ and g(x)→∞.g(x)→∞. We are interested in limx→∞(f(x)−g(x)).limx→∞(f(x)−g(x)). Depending on whether f(x)f(x) grows faster, g(x)g(x) grows faster, or they grow at the same rate, as we see next, anything can happen in this limit. Since f(x)→∞f(x)→∞ and g(x)→∞,g(x)→∞, we write ∞−∞∞−∞ to denote the form of this limit. As with our other indeterminate forms, ∞−∞∞−∞ has no meaning on its own and we must do more analysis to determine the value of the limit. For example, suppose the exponent nn in the function f(x)=3xnf(x)=3xn is n=3,n=3, then

 By combining the fractions, we can write the function as a quotient. Since the least common denominator is x2tanx,x2tanx, we have
_paragraph_87
 x2tanx,x2tanx,
_paragraph_88
 As x→0+,x→0+, the numerator tanx−x2→0tanx−x2→0 and the denominator x2tanx→0.x2tanx→0. Therefore, we can apply L’Hôpital’s rule. Taking the derivatives of the numerator and the denominator, we have

 Another type of indeterminate form that arises when evaluating limits involves exponents. The expressions 00,00, ∞0,∞0, and 1∞1∞ are all indeterminate forms. On their own, these expressions are meaningless because we cannot actually evaluate these expressions as we would evaluate an expression involving real numbers. Rather, these expressions represent forms that arise when finding limits. Now we examine how L’Hôpital’s rule can be used to evaluate limits involving these indeterminate forms.

 00,00,
_paragraph_104
 ∞0,∞0,
_paragraph_105
 1∞1∞
_paragraph_106
 Since L’Hôpital’s rule applies to quotients, we use the natural logarithm function and its properties to reduce a problem evaluating a limit involving exponents to a related problem involving a limit of a quotient. For example, suppose we want to evaluate limx→af(x)g(x)limx→af(x)g(x) and we arrive at the indeterminate form ∞0.∞0. (The indeterminate forms 0000 and 1∞1∞ can be handled similarly.) We proceed as follows. Let
_paragraph_107
 limx→af(x)g(x)limx→af(x)g(x)
_paragraph_108
 ∞0.∞0.
_paragraph_109
 0000
_paragraph_110
 1∞1∞
_paragraph_111
 Then,
_paragraph_112
 Therefore,
_paragraph_113
 Since limx→af(x)=∞,limx→af(x)=∞, we know that limx→aln(f(x))=∞.limx→aln(f(x))=∞. Therefore, limx→ag(x)ln(f(x))limx→ag(x)ln(f(x)) is of the indeterminate form 0·∞,0·∞, and we can use the techniques discussed earlier to rewrite the expression g(x)ln(f(x))g(x)ln(f(x)) in a form so that we can apply L’Hôpital’s rule. Suppose limx→ag(x)ln(f(x))=L,limx→ag(x)ln(f(x))=L, where LL may be ∞∞ or −∞.−∞. Then
_paragraph_114
 limx→af(x)=∞,limx→af(x)=∞,

 Another type of indeterminate form is ∞−∞.∞−∞. Consider the following example. Let nn be a positive integer and let f(x)=3xnf(x)=3xn and g(x)=3x2+5.g(x)=3x2+5. As x→∞,x→∞, f(x)→∞f(x)→∞ and g(x)→∞.g(x)→∞. We are interested in limx→∞(f(x)−g(x)).limx→∞(f(x)−g(x)).

As with our other indeterminate forms, ∞−∞∞−∞ has no meaning on its own and we must do more analysis to determine the value of the limit.

_paragraph_31
 By combining the fractions, we can write the function as a quotient. Since the least common denominator is x2tanx,x2tanx, we have
_paragraph_32
 x2tanx,x2tanx,
_paragraph_33
 As x→0+,x→0+, the numerator tanx−x2→0tanx−x2→0 and the denominator x2tanx→0.x2tanx→0. Therefore, we can apply L’Hôpital’s rule. Taking the derivatives of the numerator and the denominator, we have
_paragraph_34
 x→0+,x→0+,
_paragraph_35
 tanx−x2→0tanx−x2→0
_paragraph_36
 x2tanx→0.x2tanx→0.

 As x→0+,x→0+, (sec2x)−2x→1(sec2x)−2x→1 and x2sec2x+2xtanx→0.x2sec2x+2xtanx→0. Since the denominator is positive as xx approaches zero from the right, we conclude that

_paragraph_47
 Another type of indeterminate form that arises when evaluating limits involves exponents. The expressions 00,00, ∞0,∞0, and 1∞1∞ are all indeterminate forms. On their own, these expressions are meaningless because we cannot actually evaluate these expressions as we would evaluate an expression involving real numbers. Rather, these expressions represent forms that arise when finding limits. Now we examine how L’Hôpital’s rule can be used to evaluate limits involving these indeterminate forms.
_paragraph_48
 00,00,
_paragraph_49
 ∞0,∞0,
_paragraph_50
 1∞1∞
_paragraph_51
 Since L’Hôpital’s rule applies to quotients, we use the natural logarithm function and its properties to reduce a problem evaluating a limit involving exponents to a related problem involving a limit of a quotient. For example, suppose we want to evaluate limx→af(x)g(x)limx→af(x)g(x) and we arrive at the indeterminate form ∞0.∞0. (The indeterminate forms 0000 and 1∞1∞ can be handled similarly.) We proceed as follows. Let
_paragraph_52
 limx→af(x)g(x)limx→af(x)g(x)
_paragraph_53
 ∞0.∞0.
_paragraph_54
 0000
_paragraph_55
 1∞1∞
_paragraph_56
 Then,
_paragraph_57
 Therefore,
_paragraph_58
 Since limx→af(x)=∞,limx→af(x)=∞, we know that limx→aln(f(x))=∞.limx→aln(f(x))=∞. Therefore, limx→ag(x)ln(f(x))limx→ag(x)ln(f(x)) is of the indeterminate form 0·∞,0·∞, and we can use the techniques discussed earlier to rewrite the expression g(x)ln(f(x))g(x)ln(f(x)) in a form so that we can apply L’Hôpital’s rule. Suppose limx→ag(x)ln(f(x))=L,limx→ag(x)ln(f(x))=L, where LL may be ∞∞ or −∞.−∞. Then
_paragraph_59
 limx→af(x)=∞,limx→af(x)=∞,
_paragraph_60
 limx→aln(f(x))=∞.limx→aln(f(x))=∞.
_paragraph_61

 We need to evaluate limx→∞lnxx.limx→∞lnxx. Applying L’Hôpital’s rule, we obtain
_paragraph_78
 limx→∞lnxx.limx→∞lnxx.
_paragraph_79
 Therefore, limx→∞lny=0.limx→∞lny=0. Since the natural logarithm function is continuous, we conclude that

 limx→∞lny=0.limx→∞lny=0.

 We now evaluate limx→0+sinxlnx.limx→0+sinxlnx. Since limx→0+sinx=0limx→0+sinx=0 and limx→0+lnx=−∞,limx→0+lnx=−∞, we have the indeterminate form 0·∞.0·∞. To apply L’Hôpital’s rule, we need to rewrite sinxlnxsinxlnx as a fraction. We could write
_paragraph_95
 limx→0+sinxlnx.limx→0+sinxlnx.
_paragraph_96
 limx→0+sinx=0limx→0+sinx=0

 or
_paragraph_101
 Let’s consider the first option. In this case, applying L’Hôpital’s rule, we would obtain
_paragraph_102
 Unfortunately, we not only have another expression involving the indeterminate form 0·∞,0·∞, but the new limit is even more complicated to evaluate than the one with which we started. Instead, we try the second option. By writing
_paragraph_103
 0·∞,0·∞,
_paragraph_104
 and applying L’Hôpital’s rule, we obtain
_paragraph_105
 Using the fact that cscx=1sinxcscx=1sinx and cotx=cosxsinx,cotx=cosxsinx, we can rewrite the expression on the right-hand side as
_paragraph_106
 cscx=1sinxcscx=1sinx
_paragraph_107
 cotx=cosxsinx,cotx=cosxsinx,
_paragraph_108
 We conclude that limx→0+lny=0.limx→0+lny=0. Therefore, ln(limx→0+y)=0ln(limx→0+y)=0 and we have

 limx→0+lny=0.limx→0+lny=0.

Growth Rates of Functions,"_paragraph_1
 Suppose the functions ff and gg both approach infinity as x→∞.x→∞. Although the values of both functions become arbitrarily large as the values of xx become sufficiently large, sometimes one function is growing more quickly than the other. For example, f(x)=x2f(x)=x2 and g(x)=x3g(x)=x3 both approach infinity as x→∞.x→∞. However, as shown in the following table, the values of x3x3 are growing much faster than the values of x2.x2.

 Consider the task of finding the solutions of f(x)=0.f(x)=0. If ff is the first-degree polynomial f(x)=ax+b,f(x)=ax+b, then the solution of f(x)=0f(x)=0 is given by the formula x=−ba.x=−ba. If ff is the second-degree polynomial f(x)=ax2+bx+c,f(x)=ax2+bx+c, the solutions of f(x)=0f(x)=0 can be found by using the quadratic formula. However, for polynomials of degree 33 or more, finding roots of ff becomes more complicated. Although formulas exist for third- and fourth-degree polynomials, they are quite complicated. Also, if ff is a polynomial of degree 55 or greater, it is known that no such formulas exist. For example, consider the function
_paragraph_2
 f(x)=0.f(x)=0.

 No formula exists that allows us to find the solutions of f(x)=0.f(x)=0. Similar difficulties exist for nonpolynomial functions. For example, consider the task of finding solutions of tan(x)−x=0.tan(x)−x=0. No simple formula exists for the solutions of this equation. In cases such as these, we can use Newton’s method to approximate the roots.
_paragraph_15
 f(x)=0.f(x)=0.
_paragraph_16
 tan(x)−x=0.tan(x)−x=0.
_paragraph_17
 Newton’s method makes use of the following idea to approximate the solutions of f(x)=0.f(x)=0. By sketching a graph of f,f, we can estimate a root of f(x)=0.f(x)=0. Let’s call this estimate x0.x0. We then draw the tangent line to ff at x0.x0. If f′(x0)≠0,f′(x0)≠0, this tangent line intersects the xx-axis at some point (x1,0).(x1,0). Now let x1x1 be the next approximation to the actual root. Typically, x1x1 is closer than x0x0 to an actual root. Next we draw the tangent line to ff at x1.x1. If f′(x1)≠0,f′(x1)≠0, this tangent line also intersects the xx-axis, producing another approximation, x2.x2. We continue in this way, deriving a list of approximations: x0,x1,x2,….x0,x1,x2,…. Typically, the numbers x0,x1,x2,…x0,x1,x2,… quickly approach an actual root x*,x*, as shown in the following figure.

 The approximations x0,x1,x2,…x0,x1,x2,… approach the actual root x*.x*. The approximations are derived by looking at tangent lines to the graph of f.f.
_paragraph_42
 Now let’s look at how to calculate the approximations x0,x1,x2,….x0,x1,x2,…. If x0x0 is our first approximation, the approximation x1x1 is defined by letting (x1,0)(x1,0) be the xx-intercept of the tangent line to ff at x0.x0. The equation of this tangent line is given by

_paragraph_53
 x1,x1,
_paragraph_54
 Similarly, the point (x2,0)(x2,0) is the xx-intercept of the tangent line to ff at x1.x1. Therefore, x2x2 satisfies the equation

 Use Newton’s method to approximate a root of f(x)=x3−3x+1f(x)=x3−3x+1 in the interval [1,2].[1,2]. Let x0=2x0=2 and find x1,x2,x3,x4,x1,x2,x3,x4, and x5.x5.

 Solution
_paragraph_74
 From Figure 4.78, we see that ff has one root over the interval (1,2).(1,2). Therefore x0=2x0=2 seems like a reasonable first approximation. To find the next approximation, we use Equation 4.8. Since f(x)=x3−3x+1,f(x)=x3−3x+1, the derivative is f′(x)=3x2−3.f′(x)=3x2−3. Using Equation 4.8 with n=1n=1 (and a calculator that displays 1010 digits), we obtain
_paragraph_75
 ff
_paragraph_76
 (1,2).(1,2).
_paragraph_77
 x0=2x0=2
_paragraph_78
 f(x)=x3−3x+1,f(x)=x3−3x+1,
_paragraph_79
 f′(x)=3x2−3.f′(x)=3x2−3.
_paragraph_80
 n=1n=1
_paragraph_81
 1010
_paragraph_82
 To find the next approximation, x2,x2, we use Equation 4.8 with n=2n=2 and the value of x1x1 stored on the calculator. We find that
_paragraph_83
 x2,x2,
_paragraph_84
 n=2n=2
_paragraph_85
 x1x1
_paragraph_86
 Continuing in this way, we obtain the following results:
_paragraph_87
 We note that we obtained the same value for x5x5 and x6.x6. Therefore, any subsequent application of Newton’s method will most likely give the same value for xn.xn.

 When using Newton’s method, each approximation after the initial guess is defined in terms of the previous approximation by using the same formula. In particular, by defining the function F(x)=x−[f(x)f′(x)],F(x)=x−[f(x)f′(x)], we can rewrite Equation 4.8 as xn=F(xn−1).xn=F(xn−1). This type of process, where each xnxn is defined in terms of xn−1xn−1 by repeating the same function, is an example of an iterative process. Shortly, we examine other iterative processes. First, let’s look at the reasons why Newton’s method could fail to find a root.

Since f(x)=x3−3x+1,f(x)=x3−3x+1, the derivative is f′(x)=3x2−3.f′(x)=3x2−3. Using Equation 4.8 with n=1n=1 (and a calculator that displays 1010 digits), we obtain

Failures of Newton’s Method,"_paragraph_1

Other Iterative Processes,"_paragraph_1

_paragraph_2
 Consider a function FF and an initial number x0.x0. Define the subsequent numbers xnxn by the formula xn=F(xn−1).xn=F(xn−1). This process is an iterative process that creates a list of numbers x0,x1,x2,…,xn,….x0,x1,x2,…,xn,…. This list of numbers may approach a finite number x*x* as nn gets larger, or it may not. In Example 4.49, we see an example of a function FF and an initial guess x0x0 such that the resulting list of numbers approaches a finite value.

 Figure 4.82 provides a graphical argument that the values approach 88 as n→∞.n→∞. Starting at the point (x0,x0),(x0,x0), we draw a vertical line to the point (x0,F(x0)).(x0,F(x0)). The next number in our list is x1=F(x0).x1=F(x0). We use x1x1 to calculate x2.x2. Therefore, we draw a horizontal line connecting (x0,x1)(x0,x1) to the point (x1,x1)(x1,x1) on the line y=x,y=x, and then draw a vertical line connecting (x1,x1)(x1,x1) to the point (x1,F(x1)).(x1,F(x1)). The output F(x1)F(x1) becomes x2.x2. Continuing in this way, we could create an infinite number of line segments. These line segments are trapped between the lines F(x)=x2+4F(x)=x2+4 and y=x.y=x. The line segments get closer to the intersection point of these two lines, which occurs when x=F(x).x=F(x). Solving the equation x=x2+4,x=x2+4, we conclude they intersect at x=8.x=8. Therefore, our graphical evidence agrees with our numerical evidence that the list of numbers x0,x1,x2,…x0,x1,x2,… approaches x*=8x*=8 as n→∞.n→∞.

 Iterative Processes and Chaos
_paragraph_72
 Iterative processes can yield some very interesting behavior. In this section, we have seen several examples of iterative processes that converge to a fixed point. We also saw in Example 4.48 that the iterative process bounced back and forth between two values. We call this kind of behavior a 22-cycle. Iterative processes can converge to cycles with various periodicities, such as 2−cycles,4−cycles2−cycles,4−cycles (where the iterative process repeats a sequence of four values), 8-cycles, and so on.

 Some iterative processes yield what mathematicians call chaos. In this case, the iterative process jumps from value to value in a seemingly random fashion and never converges or settles into a cycle. Although a complete exploration of chaos is beyond the scope of this text, in this project we look at one of the key properties of a chaotic iterative process: sensitive dependence on initial conditions. This property refers to the concept that small changes in initial conditions can generate drastically different behavior in the iterative process.
_paragraph_76
 chaos
_paragraph_77
 Probably the best-known example of chaos is the Mandelbrot set (see Figure 4.83), named after Benoit Mandelbrot (1924–2010), who investigated its properties and helped popularize the field of chaos theory. The Mandelbrot set is usually generated by computer and shows fascinating details on enlargement, including self-replication of the set. Several colorized versions of the set have been shown in museums and can be found online and in popular books on the subject.

 The Mandelbrot set is a well-known example of a set of points generated by the iterative chaotic behavior of a relatively simple function.

 In this project we use the logistic map
_paragraph_83
 as the function in our iterative process. The logistic map is a deceptively simple function; but, depending on the value of r,r, the resulting iterative process displays some very interesting behavior. It can lead to fixed points, cycles, and even chaos.
_paragraph_84
 r,r,
_paragraph_85
 To visualize the long-term behavior of the iterative process associated with the logistic map, we will use a tool called a cobweb diagram. As we did with the iterative process we examined earlier in this section, we first draw a vertical line from the point (x0,0)(x0,0) to the point (x0,f(x0))=(x0,x1).(x0,f(x0))=(x0,x1). We then draw a horizontal line from that point to the point (x1,x1),(x1,x1), then draw a vertical line to (x1,f(x1))=(x1,x2),(x1,f(x1))=(x1,x2), and continue the process until the long-term behavior of the system becomes apparent. Figure 4.84 shows the long-term behavior of the logistic map when r=3.55r=3.55 and x0=0.2.x0=0.2. (The first 100100 iterations are not plotted.) The long-term behavior of this iterative process is an 88-cycle.

 At this point, we know how to find derivatives of various functions. We now ask the opposite question. Given a function f,f, how can we find a function with derivative f?f? If we can find a function FF with derivative f,f, we call FF an antiderivative of f.f.

 Consider the function f(x)=2x.f(x)=2x. Knowing the power rule of differentiation, we conclude that F(x)=x2F(x)=x2 is an antiderivative of ff since F′(x)=2x.F′(x)=2x. Are there any other antiderivatives of f?f? Yes; since the derivative of any constant CC is zero, x2+Cx2+C is also an antiderivative of 2x.2x. Therefore, x2+5x2+5 and x2−2x2−2 are also antiderivatives. Are there any others that are not of the form x2+Cx2+C for some constant C?C? The answer is no. From Corollary 22 of the Mean Value Theorem, we know that if FF and GG are differentiable functions such that F′(x)=G′(x),F′(x)=G′(x), then F(x)−G(x)=CF(x)−G(x)=C for some constant C.C. This fact leads to the following important theorem.

 We now look at the formal notation used to represent antiderivatives and examine some of their properties. These properties allow us to find antiderivatives of more complicated functions. Given a function f,f, we use the notation f′(x)f′(x) or dfdxdfdx to denote the derivative of f.f. Here we introduce notation for antiderivatives. If FF is an antiderivative of f,f, we say that F(x)+CF(x)+C is the most general antiderivative of ff and write

 For a function ff and an antiderivative F,F, the functions F(x)+C,F(x)+C, where CC is any real number, is often referred to as the family of antiderivatives of f.f. For example, since x2x2 is an antiderivative of 2x2x and any antiderivative of 2x2x is of the form x2+C,x2+C, we write

 In Table 4.13, we listed the indefinite integrals for many elementary functions. Let’s now turn our attention to evaluating indefinite integrals for more complicated functions. For example, consider finding an antiderivative of a sum f+g.f+g. In Example 4.51a. we showed that an antiderivative of the sum x+exx+ex is given by the sum (x22)+ex(x22)+ex—that is, an antiderivative of a sum is given by a sum of antiderivatives. This result was not specific to this example. In general, if FF and GG are antiderivatives of any functions ff and g,g, respectively, then
_paragraph_77
 f+g.f+g.

 F(x)+G(x)F(x)+G(x)

 f(x)+g(x)f(x)+g(x)

 Similarly,

 for any real number k,k, we conclude that

 From this theorem, we can evaluate any integral involving a sum, difference, or constant multiple of functions with antiderivatives that are known. Evaluating integrals involving products, quotients, or compositions is more complicated (see Example 4.51b. for an example involving an antiderivative of a product.) We look at and address integrals involving these more complicated functions in Introduction to Integration. In the next example, we examine how to use this theorem to calculate the indefinite integrals of several functions.

Initial-Value Problems,"_paragraph_1
 We look at techniques for integrating a large variety of functions involving products, quotients, and compositions later in the text. Here we turn to one common use for antiderivatives that arises often in many applications: solving differential equations.
_paragraph_2
 A differential equation is an equation that relates an unknown function and one or more of its derivatives. The equation
_paragraph_3
 (4.9)
_paragraph_4
 is a simple example of a differential equation. Solving this equation means finding a function yy with a derivative f.f. Therefore, the solutions of Equation 4.9 are the antiderivatives of f.f. If FF is one antiderivative of f,f, every function of the form y=F(x)+Cy=F(x)+C is a solution of that differential equation. For example, the solutions of

 Sometimes we are interested in determining whether a particular solution curve passes through a certain point (x0,y0)(x0,y0)—that is, y(x0)=y0.y(x0)=y0. The problem of finding a function yy that satisfies a differential equation

 and the initial condition
_paragraph_24
 is an example of an initial-value problem. Since the solutions of the differential equation are y=2x3+C,y=2x3+C, to find a function yy that also satisfies the initial condition, we need to find CC such that y(1)=2(1)3+C=5.y(1)=2(1)3+C=5. From this equation, we see that C=3,C=3, and we conclude that y=2x3+3y=2x3+3 is the solution of this initial-value problem as shown in the following graph.

 Initial-value problems arise in many applications. Next we consider a problem in which a driver applies the brakes in a car. We are interested in how long it takes for the car to stop. Recall that the velocity function v(t)v(t) is the derivative of a position function s(t),s(t), and the acceleration a(t)a(t) is the derivative of the velocity function. In earlier examples in the text, we could calculate the velocity from the position and then compute the acceleration from the velocity. In the next example we work the other way around. Given an acceleration function, we calculate the velocity function. We then use the velocity function to determine the position function.

 A differentiable function y=f(x)y=f(x) can be approximated at aa by the linear function
L(x)=f(a)+f′(a)(x−a).L(x)=f(a)+f′(a)(x−a).
For a function y=f(x),y=f(x), if xx changes from aa to a+dx,a+dx, then
dy=f′(x)dxdy=f′(x)dx
is an approximation for the change in y.y. The actual change in yy is
Δy=f(a+dx)−f(a).Δy=f(a+dx)−f(a).
A measurement error dxdx can lead to an error in a calculated quantity f(x).f(x). The error in the calculated quantity is known as the propagated error. The propagated error can be estimated by
dy≈f′(x)dx.dy≈f′(x)dx.

 A function may have both an absolute maximum and an absolute minimum, have just one absolute extremum, or have no absolute maximum or absolute minimum.
If a function has a local extremum, the point at which it occurs must be a critical point. However, a function need not have a local extremum at a critical point.

 The limit of f(x)f(x) is LL as x→∞x→∞ (or as x→−∞)x→−∞) if the values f(x)f(x) become arbitrarily close to LL as xx becomes sufficiently large.

The limit of f(x)f(x) is −∞−∞ as x→∞x→∞ if f(x)<0f(x)<0 and |f(x)||f(x)| becomes arbitrarily large as xx becomes sufficiently large. We can define the limit of f(x)f(x) as xx approaches −∞−∞ similarly.
For a polynomial function p(x)=anxn+an−1xn−1+…+a1x+a0,p(x)=anxn+an−1xn−1+…+a1x+a0, where an≠0,an≠0, the end behavior is determined by the leading term anxn.anxn. If n≠0,n≠0, p(x)p(x) approaches ∞∞ or −∞−∞ at each end.
For a rational function f(x)=p(x)q(x),f(x)=p(x)q(x), the end behavior is determined by the relationship between the degree of pp and the degree of q.q. If the degree of pp is less than the degree of q,q, the line y=0y=0 is a horizontal asymptote for f.f. If the degree of pp is equal to the degree of q,q, then the line y=anbny=anbn is a horizontal asymptote, where anan and bnbn are the leading coefficients of pp and q,q, respectively.

 Newton’s Method","_list_1
 Newton’s method approximates roots of f(x)=0f(x)=0 by starting with an initial approximation x0,x0, then uses tangent lines to the graph of ff to create a sequence of approximations x1,x2,x3,….x1,x2,x3,….
Typically, Newton’s method is an efficient method for finding a particular root. In certain cases, Newton’s method fails to work because the list of numbers x0,x1,x2,…x0,x1,x2,… does not approach a finite value or it approaches a value other than the root sought.
Any process in which a list of numbers x0,x1,x2,…x0,x1,x2,… is generated by defining an initial number x0x0 and defining the subsequent numbers by the equation xn=F(xn−1)xn=F(xn−1) for some function FF is an iterative process.

The Greek capital letter Σ,Σ, sigma, is used to express long sums of values in a compact form. For example, if we want to add all the integers from 1 to 20 without sigma notation, we have to write

 sigma notation
_paragraph_3
 summation notation
_paragraph_4
 Σ,Σ,
_paragraph_5
 We could probably skip writing a couple of terms and write
_paragraph_6
 which is better, but still cumbersome. With sigma notation, we write this sum as
_paragraph_7
 which is much more compact.
_paragraph_8
 Typically, sigma notation is presented in the form
_paragraph_9
 where aiai describes the terms to be added, and the i is called the index. Each term is evaluated, then we sum all the values, beginning with the value when i=1i=1 and ending with the value when i=n.i=n. For example, an expression like ∑i=27si∑i=27si is interpreted as s2+s3+s4+s5+s6+s7.s2+s3+s4+s5+s6+s7. Note that the index is used only to keep track of the terms to be added; it does not factor into the calculation of the sum itself. The index is therefore called a dummy variable. We can use any letter we like for the index. Typically, mathematicians use i, j, k, m, and n for indices.

Approximating Area,"_paragraph_1
 Now that we have the necessary notation, we return to the problem at hand: approximating the area under a curve. Let f(x)f(x) be a continuous, nonnegative function defined on the closed interval [a,b].[a,b]. We want to approximate the area A bounded by f(x)f(x) above, the x-axis below, the line x=ax=a on the left, and the line x=bx=b on the right (Figure 5.2).

 An area (shaded region) bounded by the curve f(x)f(x) at top, the x-axis at bottom, the line x=ax=a to the left, and the line x=bx=b at right.
_paragraph_10
 How do we approximate the area under this curve? The approach is a geometric one. By dividing a region into many small shapes that have known area formulas, we can sum these areas and obtain a reasonable estimate of the true area. We begin by dividing the interval [a,b][a,b] into n subintervals of equal width, b−an.b−an. We do this by selecting equally spaced points x0,x1,x2,…,xnx0,x1,x2,…,xn with x0=a,xn=b,x0=a,xn=b, and

_paragraph_18
 Δx=b−anΔx=b−an
_paragraph_19
 for i=1,2,3,…,n.i=1,2,3,…,n. This notion of dividing an interval [a,b][a,b] into subintervals by selecting points from within the interval is used quite often in approximating the area under a curve, so let’s define some relevant terminology.

 Rule: Left-Endpoint Approximation
_paragraph_35
 On each subinterval [xi−1,xi][xi−1,xi] (for i=1,2,3,…,n),i=1,2,3,…,n), construct a rectangle with width Δx and height equal to f(xi−1),f(xi−1), which is the function value at the left endpoint of the subinterval. Then the area of this rectangle is f(xi−1)Δx.f(xi−1)Δx. Adding the areas of all these rectangles, we get an approximate value for A (Figure 5.3). We use the notation Ln to denote that this is a left-endpoint approximation of A using n subintervals.

 In the right-endpoint approximation of area under a curve, the height of each rectangle is determined by the function value at the right of each subinterval. Note that the right-endpoint approximation differs from the left-endpoint approximation in Figure 5.3.
_paragraph_58
 The graphs in Figure 5.5 represent the curve f(x)=x22.f(x)=x22. In graph (a) we divide the region represented by the interval [0,3][0,3] into six subintervals, each of width 0.5. Thus, Δx=0.5.Δx=0.5. We then form six rectangles by drawing vertical lines perpendicular to xi−1,xi−1, the left endpoint of each subinterval. We determine the height of each rectangle by calculating f(xi−1)f(xi−1) for i=1,2,3,4,5,6.i=1,2,3,4,5,6. The intervals are [0,0.5],[0.5,1],[1,1.5],[1.5,2],[2,2.5],[2.5,3].[0,0.5],[0.5,1],[1,1.5],[1.5,2],[2,2.5],[2.5,3]. We find the area of each rectangle by multiplying the height by the width. Then, the sum of the rectangular areas approximates the area between f(x)f(x) and the x-axis. When the left endpoints are used to calculate height, we have a left-endpoint approximation. Thus,

The intervals [0,0.5],[0.5,1],[1,1.5],[1.5,2][0,0.5],[0.5,1],[1,1.5],[1.5,2] are shown in Figure 5.6.

 Looking at Figure 5.5 and the graphs in Example 5.4, we can see that when we use a small number of intervals, neither the left-endpoint approximation nor the right-endpoint approximation is a particularly accurate estimate of the area under the curve. However, it seems logical that if we increase the number of points in our partition, our estimate of A will improve. We will have more rectangles, but each rectangle will be thinner, so we will be able to fit the rectangles to the curve more precisely.
_paragraph_105
 We can demonstrate the improved approximation obtained through smaller intervals with an example. Let’s explore the idea of increasing n, first in a left-endpoint approximation with four rectangles, then eight rectangles, and finally 32 rectangles. Then, let’s do the same thing in a right-endpoint approximation, using the same sets of intervals, of the same curved region. Figure 5.8 shows the area of the region under the curve f(x)=(x−1)3+4f(x)=(x−1)3+4 on the interval [0,2][0,2] using a left-endpoint approximation where n=4.n=4. The width of each rectangle is

 Figure 5.9 shows the same curve divided into eight subintervals. Comparing the graph with four rectangles in Figure 5.8 with this graph with eight rectangles, we can see there appears to be less white space under the curve when n=8.n=8. This white space is area under the curve we are unable to include using our approximation. The area of the rectangles is

 Based on these figures and calculations, it appears we are on the right track; the rectangles appear to approximate the area under the curve better as n gets larger. Furthermore, as n increases, both the left-endpoint and right-endpoint approximations appear to approach an area of 8 square units. Table 5.1 shows a numerical comparison of the left- and right-endpoint methods. The idea that the approximations of the area under the curve get better and better as n gets larger and larger is very important, and we now explore this idea in more detail.

Forming Riemann Sums,"_paragraph_1
 So far we have been using rectangles to approximate the area under a curve. The heights of these rectangles have been determined by evaluating the function at either the right or left endpoints of the subinterval [xi−1,xi].[xi−1,xi]. In reality, there is no reason to restrict evaluation of the function to one of these two points only. We could evaluate the function at any point xi*xi* in the subinterval [xi−1,xi],[xi−1,xi], and use f(xi*)f(xi*) as the height of our rectangle. This gives us an estimate for the area of the form

_paragraph_3
 xi*xi*
_paragraph_4
 [xi−1,xi],[xi−1,xi],
_paragraph_5

 A sum of this form is called a Riemann sum, named for the 19th-century mathematician Bernhard Riemann, who developed the idea.
_paragraph_7
 Definition
_paragraph_8
 Let f(x)f(x) be defined on a closed interval [a,b][a,b] and let P be a regular partition of [a,b].[a,b]. Let Δx be the width of each subinterval [xi−1,xi][xi−1,xi] and for each i, let xi*xi* be any point in [xi−1,xi].[xi−1,xi]. A Riemann sum is defined for f(x)f(x) as

_paragraph_17
 Recall that with the left- and right-endpoint approximations, the estimates seem to get better and better as n get larger and larger. The same thing happens with Riemann sums. Riemann sums give better approximations for larger values of n. We are now ready to define the area under a curve in terms of Riemann sums.
_paragraph_18
 Definition
_paragraph_19
 Let f(x)f(x) be a continuous, nonnegative function on an interval [a,b],[a,b], and let ∑i=1nf(xi*)Δx∑i=1nf(xi*)Δx be a Riemann sum for f(x).f(x). Then, the area under the curve y=f(x)y=f(x) on [a,b][a,b] is given by

_paragraph_29
 Some subtleties here are worth discussing. First, note that taking the limit of a sum is a little different from taking the limit of a function f(x)f(x) as x goes to infinity. Limits of sums are discussed in detail in the chapter on Sequences and Series; however, for now we can assume that the computational techniques we used to compute limits of functions can also be used to calculate limits of sums.
_paragraph_30
 f(x)f(x)
_paragraph_31
 Second, we must consider what to do if the expression converges to different limits for different choices of {xi*}.{xi*}. Fortunately, this does not happen. Although the proof is beyond the scope of this text, it can be shown that if f(x)f(x) is continuous on the closed interval [a,b],[a,b], then limn→∞∑i=1nf(xi*)Δxlimn→∞∑i=1nf(xi*)Δx exists and is unique (in other words, it does not depend on the choice of {xi*}).{xi*}).

_paragraph_36
 {xi*}).{xi*}).
_paragraph_37
 We look at some examples shortly. But, before we do, let’s take a moment and talk about some specific choices for {xi*}.{xi*}. Although any choice for {xi*}{xi*} gives us an estimate of the area under the curve, we don’t necessarily know whether that estimate is too high (overestimate) or too low (underestimate). If it is important to know whether our estimate is high or low, we can select our value for {xi*}{xi*} to guarantee one result or the other.
_paragraph_38
 {xi*}.{xi*}.
_paragraph_39
 {xi*}{xi*}
_paragraph_40
 {xi*}{xi*}
_paragraph_41
 If we want an overestimate, for example, we can choose {xi*}{xi*} such that for i=1,2,3,…,n,f(xi*)≥f(x)i=1,2,3,…,n,f(xi*)≥f(x) for all x∈[xi−1,xi].x∈[xi−1,xi]. In other words, we choose {xi*}{xi*} so that for i=1,2,3,…,n,f(xi*)i=1,2,3,…,n,f(xi*) is the maximum function value on the interval [xi−1,xi].[xi−1,xi]. If we select {xi*}{xi*} in this way, then the Riemann sum ∑i=1nf(xi*)Δx∑i=1nf(xi*)Δx is called an upper sum. Similarly, if we want an underestimate, we can choose {xi*}{xi*} so that for i=1,2,3,…,n,f(xi*)i=1,2,3,…,n,f(xi*) is the minimum function value on the interval [xi−1,xi].[xi−1,xi]. In this case, the associated Riemann sum is called a lower sum. Note that if f(x)f(x) is either increasing or decreasing throughout the interval [a,b],[a,b], then the maximum and minimum values of the function occur at the endpoints of the subintervals, so the upper and lower sums are just the same as the left- and right-endpoint approximations.

Because the function is decreasing over the interval [1,2],[1,2], Figure 5.14 shows that a lower sum is obtained by using the right endpoints.

 The graph of y=sinxy=sinx is divided into six regions: Δx=π/26=π12.Δx=π/26=π12.

 The intervals are [0,π12],[π12,π6],[π6,π4],[π4,π3],[π3,5π12],[0,π12],[π12,π6],[π6,π4],[π4,π3],[π3,5π12], and [5π12,π2].[5π12,π2]. Note that f(x)=sinxf(x)=sinx is increasing on the interval [0,π2],[0,π2], so a left-endpoint approximation gives us the lower sum. A left-endpoint approximation is the Riemann sum ∑i=05sinxi(π12).∑i=05sinxi(π12). We have

 The integral symbol in the previous definition should look familiar. We have seen similar notation in the chapter on Applications of Derivatives, where we used the indefinite integral symbol (without the a and b above and below) to represent an antiderivative. Although the notation for indefinite integrals may look similar to the notation for a definite integral, they are not the same. A definite integral is a number. An indefinite integral is a family of functions. Later in this chapter we examine how these concepts are related. However, close attention should always be paid to notation so we know whether we’re working with a definite integral or an indefinite integral.
_paragraph_14
 Integral notation goes back to the late seventeenth century and is one of the contributions of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, who is often considered to be the codiscoverer of calculus, along with Isaac Newton. The integration symbol ∫ is an elongated S, suggesting sigma or summation. On a definite integral, above and below the summation symbol are the boundaries of the interval, [a,b].[a,b]. The numbers a and b are x-values and are called the limits of integration; specifically, a is the lower limit and b is the upper limit. To clarify, we are using the word limit in two different ways in the context of the definite integral. First, we talk about the limit of a sum as n→∞.n→∞. Second, the boundaries of the region are called the limits of integration.

 We call the function f(x)f(x) the integrand, and the dx indicates that f(x)f(x) is a function with respect to x, called the variable of integration. Note that, like the index in a sum, the variable of integration is a dummy variable, and has no impact on the computation of the integral. We could use any variable we like as the variable of integration:

_paragraph_37
 [a,b][a,b]
_paragraph_38
 It is also worth noting here that we have retained the use of a regular partition in the Riemann sums. This restriction is not strictly necessary. Any partition can be used to form a Riemann sum. However, if a nonregular partition is used to define the definite integral, it is not sufficient to take the limit as the number of subintervals goes to infinity. Instead, we must take the limit as the width of the largest subinterval goes to zero. This introduces a little more complex notation in our limits and makes the calculations more difficult without really gaining much additional insight, so we stick with regular partitions for the Riemann sums.

Evaluating Definite Integrals,"_paragraph_1
 Evaluating definite integrals this way can be quite tedious because of the complexity of the calculations. Later in this chapter we develop techniques for evaluating definite integrals without taking limits of Riemann sums. However, for now, we can rely on the fact that definite integrals represent the area under the curve, and we can evaluate definite integrals by using geometric formulas to calculate that area. We do this to confirm that definite integrals do, indeed, represent areas, so we can then discuss what to do in the case of a curve of a function dropping below the x-axis.

 Let us return to the Riemann sum. Consider, for example, the function f(x)=2−2x2f(x)=2−2x2 (shown in Figure 5.17) on the interval [0,2].[0,2]. Use n=8n=8 and choose {xi*}{xi*} as the left endpoint of each interval. Construct a rectangle on each subinterval of height f(xi*)f(xi*) and width Δx. When f(xi*)f(xi*) is positive, the product f(xi*)Δxf(xi*)Δx represents the area of the rectangle, as before. When f(xi*)f(xi*) is negative, however, the product f(xi*)Δxf(xi*)Δx represents the negative of the area of the rectangle. The Riemann sum then becomes

 One application of the definite integral is finding displacement when given a velocity function. If v(t)v(t) represents the velocity of an object as a function of time, then the area under the curve tells us how far the object is from its original position. This is a very important application of the definite integral, and we examine it in more detail later in the chapter. For now, we’re just going to look at some basics to get a feel for how this works by studying constant velocities.
_paragraph_53

_paragraph_54

_paragraph_55
 When velocity is a constant, the area under the curve is just velocity times time. This idea is already very familiar. If a car travels away from its starting position in a straight line at a speed of 70 mph for 2 hours, then it is 140 mi away from its original position (Figure 5.20). Using integral notation, we have

_paragraph_57

_paragraph_58
 The area under the curve v(t)=70v(t)=70 tells us how far the car is from its starting point at a given time.
_paragraph_59
 In the context of displacement, net signed area allows us to take direction into account. If a car travels straight north at a speed of 60 mph for 2 hours, it is 120 mi north of its starting position. If the car then turns around and travels south at a speed of 40 mph for 3 hours, it will be back at it starting position (Figure 5.21). Again, using integral notation, we have
_paragraph_60
 In this case the displacement is zero.

 The area above the axis and the area below the axis are equal, so the net signed area is zero.

 Suppose we want to know how far the car travels overall, regardless of direction. In this case, we want to know the area between the curve and the x-axis, regardless of whether that area is above or below the axis. This is called the total area.

 total area
_paragraph_66
 Graphically, it is easiest to think of calculating total area by adding the areas above the axis and the areas below the axis (rather than subtracting the areas below the axis, as we did with net signed area). To accomplish this mathematically, we use the absolute value function. Thus, the total distance traveled by the car is

 Let us return to the Riemann sum. Consider, for example, the function f(x)=2−2x2f(x)=2−2x2 (shown in Figure 5.17) on the interval [0,2].[0,2]. Use n=8n=8 and choose {xi*}{xi*} as the left endpoint of each interval. Construct a rectangle on each subinterval of height f(xi*)f(xi*) and width Δx. When f(xi*)f(xi*) is positive, the product f(xi*)Δxf(xi*)Δx represents the area of the rectangle, as before. When f(xi*)f(xi*) is negative, however, the product f(xi*)Δxf(xi*)Δx represents the negative of the area of the rectangle. The Riemann sum then becomes

 A picture can sometimes tell us more about a function than the results of computations. Comparing functions by their graphs as well as by their algebraic expressions can often give new insight into the process of integration. Intuitively, we might say that if a function f(x)f(x) is above another function g(x),g(x), then the area between f(x)f(x) and the x-axis is greater than the area between g(x)g(x) and the x-axis. This is true depending on the interval over which the comparison is made. The properties of definite integrals are valid whether a<b,a=b,a<b,a=b, or a>b.a>b.

Comparison Properties of Integrals,"_paragraph_1
 A picture can sometimes tell us more about a function than the results of computations. Comparing functions by their graphs as well as by their algebraic expressions can often give new insight into the process of integration. Intuitively, we might say that if a function f(x)f(x) is above another function g(x),g(x), then the area between f(x)f(x) and the x-axis is greater than the area between g(x)g(x) and the x-axis. This is true depending on the interval over which the comparison is made. The properties of definite integrals are valid whether a<b,a=b,a<b,a=b, or a>b.a>b. The following properties, however, concern only the case a≤b,a≤b, and are used when we want to compare the sizes of integrals.

 Graphing these functions is necessary to understand how they compare over the interval [0,1].[0,1]. Initially, when graphed on a graphing calculator, f(x)f(x) appears to be above g(x)g(x) everywhere. However, on the interval [0,1],[0,1], the graphs appear to be on top of each other. We need to zoom in to see that, on the interval [0,1],g(x)[0,1],g(x) is above f(x).f(x). The two functions intersect at x=0x=0 and x=1x=1 (Figure 5.23).

Average Value of a Function,"_paragraph_1
 We often need to find the average of a set of numbers, such as an average test grade. Suppose you received the following test scores in your algebra class: 89, 90, 56, 78, 100, and 69. Your semester grade is your average of test scores and you want to know what grade to expect. We can find the average by adding all the scores and dividing by the number of scores. In this case, there are six test scores. Thus,
_paragraph_2
 Therefore, your average test grade is approximately 80.33, which translates to a B− at most schools.
_paragraph_3
 Suppose, however, that we have a function v(t)v(t) that gives us the speed of an object at any time t, and we want to find the object’s average speed. The function v(t)v(t) takes on an infinite number of values, so we can’t use the process just described. Fortunately, we can use a definite integral to find the average value of a function such as this.
_paragraph_4
 v(t)v(t)
_paragraph_5
 v(t)v(t)
_paragraph_6
 Let f(x)f(x) be continuous over the interval [a,b][a,b] and let [a,b][a,b] be divided into n subintervals of width Δx=(b−a)/n.Δx=(b−a)/n. Choose a representative xi*xi* in each subinterval and calculate f(xi*)f(xi*) for i=1,2,…,n.i=1,2,…,n. In other words, consider each f(xi*)f(xi*) as a sampling of the function over each subinterval. The average value of the function may then be approximated as
_paragraph_7
 f(x)f(x)
_paragraph_8
 [a,b][a,b]
_paragraph_9
 [a,b][a,b]
_paragraph_10
 Δx=(b−a)/n.Δx=(b−a)/n.
_paragraph_11
 xi*xi*
_paragraph_12
 f(xi*)f(xi*)
_paragraph_13
 i=1,2,…,n.i=1,2,…,n.
_paragraph_14
 f(xi*)f(xi*)
_paragraph_15
 which is basically the same expression used to calculate the average of discrete values.
_paragraph_16
 But we know Δx=b−an,Δx=b−an, so n=b−aΔx,n=b−aΔx, and we get
_paragraph_17
 Δx=b−an,Δx=b−an,
_paragraph_18
 n=b−aΔx,n=b−aΔx,
_paragraph_19
 Following through with the algebra, the numerator is a sum that is represented as ∑i=1nf(xi*),∑i=1nf(xi*), and we are dividing by a fraction. To divide by a fraction, invert the denominator and multiply. Thus, an approximate value for the average value of the function is given by
_paragraph_20
 ∑i=1nf(xi*),∑i=1nf(xi*),
_paragraph_21
 This is a Riemann sum. Then, to get the exact average value, take the limit as n goes to infinity. Thus, the average value of a function is given by

 The region is a trapezoid lying on its side, so we can use the area formula for a trapezoid A=12h(a+b),A=12h(a+b), where h represents height, and a and b represent the two parallel sides. Then,
_paragraph_41
 A=12h(a+b),A=12h(a+b),

The Mean Value Theorem for Integrals,"_paragraph_1
 The Mean Value Theorem for Integrals states that a continuous function on a closed interval takes on its average value at some point in that interval. The theorem guarantees that if f(x)f(x) is continuous, a point c exists in an interval [a,b][a,b] such that the value of the function at c is equal to the average value of f(x)f(x) over [a,b].[a,b]. We state this theorem mathematically with the help of the formula for the average value of a function that we presented at the end of the preceding section.

Fundamental Theorem of Calculus Part 1: Integrals and Antiderivatives,"_paragraph_1
 As mentioned earlier, the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus is an extremely powerful theorem that establishes the relationship between differentiation and integration, and gives us a way to evaluate definite integrals without using Riemann sums or calculating areas. The theorem is comprised of two parts, the first of which, the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part 1, is stated here. Part 1 establishes the relationship between differentiation and integration.

_paragraph_13
 [a,b].[a,b].
_paragraph_14
 Before we delve into the proof, a couple of subtleties are worth mentioning here. First, a comment on the notation. Note that we have defined a function, F(x),F(x), as the definite integral of another function, f(t),f(t), from the point a to the point x. At first glance, this is confusing, because we have said several times that a definite integral is a number, and here it looks like it’s a function. The key here is to notice that for any particular value of x, the definite integral is a number. So the function F(x)F(x) returns a number (the value of the definite integral) for each value of x.
_paragraph_15
 F(x),F(x),
_paragraph_16
 f(t),f(t),
_paragraph_17
 F(x)F(x)
_paragraph_18
 Second, it is worth commenting on some of the key implications of this theorem. There is a reason it is called the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. Not only does it establish a relationship between integration and differentiation, but also it guarantees that any integrable function has an antiderivative.
_paragraph_19
 Applying the definition of the derivative, we have
_paragraph_20
 Looking carefully at this last expression, we see 1h∫xx+hf(t)dt1h∫xx+hf(t)dt is just the average value of the function f(x)f(x) over the interval [x,x+h].[x,x+h]. Therefore, by The Mean Value Theorem for Integrals, there is some number c in [x,x+h][x,x+h] such that
_paragraph_21
 1h∫xx+hf(t)dt1h∫xx+hf(t)dt
_paragraph_22
 f(x)f(x)
_paragraph_23
 [x,x+h].[x,x+h].
_paragraph_24
 [x,x+h][x,x+h]
_paragraph_25
 In addition, since c is between x and x + h, c approaches x as h approaches zero. Also, since f(x)f(x) is continuous, we have limh→0f(c)=limc→xf(c)=f(x).limh→0f(c)=limc→xf(c)=f(x). Putting all these pieces together, we have
_paragraph_26
 f(x)f(x)
_paragraph_27
 limh→0f(c)=limc→xf(c)=f(x).limh→0f(c)=limc→xf(c)=f(x).

"Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part 2: The Evaluation Theorem","_paragraph_1
 The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part 2, is perhaps the most important theorem in calculus. After tireless efforts by mathematicians for approximately 500 years, new techniques emerged that provided scientists with the necessary tools to explain many phenomena. Using calculus, astronomers could finally determine distances in space and map planetary orbits. Everyday financial problems such as calculating marginal costs or predicting total profit could now be handled with simplicity and accuracy. Engineers could calculate the bending strength of materials or the three-dimensional motion of objects. Our view of the world was forever changed with calculus.
_paragraph_2
 After finding approximate areas by adding the areas of n rectangles, the application of this theorem is straightforward by comparison. It almost seems too simple that the area of an entire curved region can be calculated by just evaluating an antiderivative at the first and last endpoints of an interval.

 Julie is an avid skydiver. She has more than 300 jumps under her belt and has mastered the art of making adjustments to her body position in the air to control how fast she falls. If she arches her back and points her belly toward the ground, she reaches a terminal velocity of approximately 120 mph (176 ft/sec). If, instead, she orients her body with her head straight down, she falls faster, reaching a terminal velocity of 150 mph (220 ft/sec).

 Since Julie will be moving (falling) in a downward direction, we assume the downward direction is positive to simplify our calculations. Julie executes her jumps from an altitude of 12,500 ft. After she exits the aircraft, she immediately starts falling at a velocity given by v(t)=32t.v(t)=32t. She continues to accelerate according to this velocity function until she reaches terminal velocity. After she reaches terminal velocity, her speed remains constant until she pulls her ripcord and slows down to land.

If James can skate at a velocity of f(t)=5+2tf(t)=5+2t ft/sec and Kathy can skate at a velocity of g(t)=10+cos(π2t)g(t)=10+cos(π2t) ft/sec, who is going to win the race?
_paragraph_44
 f(t)=5+2tf(t)=5+2t
_paragraph_45
 g(t)=10+cos(π2t)g(t)=10+cos(π2t)
_paragraph_46
 Solution
_paragraph_47
 We need to integrate both functions over the interval [0,5][0,5] and see which value is bigger. For James, we want to calculate
_paragraph_48
 [0,5][0,5]
_paragraph_49
 Using the power rule, we have
_paragraph_50
 Thus, James has skated 50 ft after 5 sec. Turning now to Kathy, we want to calculate
_paragraph_51
 We know sintsint is an antiderivative of cost,cost, so it is reasonable to expect that an antiderivative of cos(π2t)cos(π2t) would involve sin(π2t).sin(π2t). However, when we differentiate sin(π2t),sin(π2t), we get π2cos(π2t)π2cos(π2t) as a result of the chain rule, so we have to account for this additional coefficient when we integrate. We obtain

 cos(π2t)cos(π2t)
_paragraph_55
 sin(π2t).sin(π2t).
_paragraph_56
 sin(π2t),sin(π2t),
_paragraph_57
 π2cos(π2t)π2cos(π2t)
_paragraph_58
 Kathy has skated approximately 50.6 ft after 5 sec. Kathy wins, but not by much!

 Skydivers can adjust the velocity of their dive by changing the position of their body during the free fall. (credit: Jeremy T. Lock)
_paragraph_67
 Julie is an avid skydiver. She has more than 300 jumps under her belt and has mastered the art of making adjustments to her body position in the air to control how fast she falls. If she arches her back and points her belly toward the ground, she reaches a terminal velocity of approximately 120 mph (176 ft/sec). If, instead, she orients her body with her head straight down, she falls faster, reaching a terminal velocity of 150 mph (220 ft/sec).

 skydiver
_paragraph_69
 Since Julie will be moving (falling) in a downward direction, we assume the downward direction is positive to simplify our calculations. Julie executes her jumps from an altitude of 12,500 ft. After she exits the aircraft, she immediately starts falling at a velocity given by v(t)=32t.v(t)=32t. She continues to accelerate according to this velocity function until she reaches terminal velocity. After she reaches terminal velocity, her speed remains constant until she pulls her ripcord and slows down to land.
_paragraph_70
 v(t)=32t.v(t)=32t.
_paragraph_71
 On her first jump of the day, Julie orients herself in the slower “belly down” position (terminal velocity is 176 ft/sec). Using this information, answer the following questions.

 Kepler’s first law states that the planets move in elliptical orbits with the Sun at one focus. The closest point of a planetary orbit to the Sun is called the perihelion (for Earth, it currently occurs around January 3) and the farthest point is called the aphelion (for Earth, it currently occurs around July 4). Kepler’s second law states that planets sweep out equal areas of their elliptical orbits in equal times. Thus, the two arcs indicated in the following figure are swept out in equal times.

The Net Change Theorem,"_paragraph_1
 The net change theorem considers the integral of a rate of change. It says that when a quantity changes, the new value equals the initial value plus the integral of the rate of change of that quantity. The formula can be expressed in two ways. The second is more familiar; it is simply the definite integral.

 The significance of the net change theorem lies in the results. Net change can be applied to area, distance, and volume, to name only a few applications. Net change accounts for negative quantities automatically without having to write more than one integral. To illustrate, let’s apply the net change theorem to a velocity function in which the result is displacement.
_paragraph_12

_paragraph_13
 displacement
_paragraph_14
 We looked at a simple example of this in The Definite Integral. Suppose a car is moving due north (the positive direction) at 40 mph between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m., then the car moves south at 30 mph between 4 p.m. and 5 p.m. We can graph this motion as shown in Figure 5.32.
_paragraph_15
 Figure
_paragraph_16
 5.32
_paragraph_17
 The graph shows speed versus time for the given motion of a car.
_paragraph_18
 Just as we did before, we can use definite integrals to calculate the net displacement as well as the total distance traveled. The net displacement is given by
_paragraph_19
 Thus, at 5 p.m. the car is 50 mi north of its starting position. The total distance traveled is given by
_paragraph_20
 Therefore, between 2 p.m. and 5 p.m., the car traveled a total of 110 mi.
_paragraph_21
 To summarize, net displacement may include both positive and negative values. In other words, the velocity function accounts for both forward distance and backward distance. To find net displacement, integrate the velocity function over the interval. Total distance traveled, on the other hand, is always positive. To find the total distance traveled by an object, regardless of direction, we need to integrate the absolute value of the velocity function.
_paragraph_22
 Example
_paragraph_23
 5.24
_paragraph_24

_paragraph_38
 v(t)=3t−5v(t)=3t−5
_paragraph_39
 [0,3].[0,3].
_paragraph_40
 Solution
_paragraph_41
 The total distance traveled includes both the positive and the negative values. Therefore, we must integrate the absolute value of the velocity function to find the total distance traveled.
_paragraph_42
 To continue with the example, use two integrals to find the total distance. First, find the t-intercept of the function, since that is where the division of the interval occurs. Set the equation equal to zero and solve for t. Thus,
_paragraph_43
 The two subintervals are [0,53][0,53] and [53,3].[53,3]. To find the total distance traveled, integrate the absolute value of the function. Since the function is negative over the interval [0,53],[0,53], we have |v(t)|=−v(t)|v(t)|=−v(t) over that interval. Over [53,3],[53,3], the function is positive, so |v(t)|=v(t).|v(t)|=v(t). Thus, we have
_paragraph_44
 [0,53][0,53]
_paragraph_45
 [53,3].[53,3].
_paragraph_46
 [0,53],[0,53],
_paragraph_47
 |v(t)|=−v(t)|v(t)|=−v(t)
_paragraph_48
 [53,3],[53,3],
_paragraph_49
 |v(t)|=v(t).|v(t)|=v(t).

 So, the total distance traveled is 416416 m.

 As we saw at the beginning of the chapter, top iceboat racers (Figure 5.1) can attain speeds of up to five times the wind speed. Andrew is an intermediate iceboater, though, so he attains speeds equal to only twice the wind speed. Suppose Andrew takes his iceboat out one morning when a light 5-mph breeze has been blowing all morning. As Andrew gets his iceboat set up, though, the wind begins to pick up. During his first half hour of iceboating, the wind speed increases according to the function v(t)=20t+5.v(t)=20t+5. For the second half hour of Andrew’s outing, the wind remains steady at 15 mph. In other words, the wind speed is given by
_paragraph_17

_paragraph_18
 v(t)=20t+5.v(t)=20t+5.
_paragraph_19
 Recalling that Andrew’s iceboat travels at twice the wind speed, and assuming he moves in a straight line away from his starting point, how far is Andrew from his starting point after 1 hour?
_paragraph_20
 Solution
_paragraph_21
 To figure out how far Andrew has traveled, we need to integrate his velocity, which is twice the wind speed. Then
_paragraph_22
 Distance =∫012v(t)dt.=∫012v(t)dt.
_paragraph_23
 =∫012v(t)dt.=∫012v(t)dt.

 v(t)=−10t+15.v(t)=−10t+15.

Integrating Even and Odd Functions,"_paragraph_1
 We saw in Functions and Graphs that an even function is a function in which f(−x)=f(x)f(−x)=f(x) for all x in the domain—that is, the graph of the curve is unchanged when x is replaced with −x. The graphs of even functions are symmetric about the y-axis. An odd function is one in which f(−x)=−f(x)f(−x)=−f(x) for all x in the domain, and the graph of the function is symmetric about the origin.

_paragraph_6
 Integrals of even functions, when the limits of integration are from −a to a, involve two equal areas, because they are symmetric about the y-axis. Integrals of odd functions, when the limits of integration are similarly [−a,a],[−a,a], evaluate to zero because the areas above and below the x-axis are equal.

 The symmetry appears in the graphs in Figure 5.35. Graph (a) shows the region below the curve and above the x-axis. We have to zoom in to this graph by a huge amount to see the region. Graph (b) shows the region above the curve and below the x-axis. The signed area of this region is negative. Both views illustrate the symmetry about the y-axis of an even function. We have
_paragraph_19
 To verify the integration formula for even functions, we can calculate the integral from 0 to 2 and double it, then check to make sure we get the same answer.

 Since 2·5003=10003,2·5003=10003, we have verified the formula for even functions in this particular example.

 Let f, g, u, and F be as specified in the theorem. Then

 Integrating both sides with respect to x, we see that

 Returning to the problem we looked at originally, we let u=x2−3u=x2−3 and then du=2xdx.du=2xdx. Rewrite the integral in terms of u:

_paragraph_19
 Solution
_paragraph_20
 The first step is to choose an expression for u. We choose u=3x2+4u=3x2+4 because then du=6xdx,du=6xdx, and we already have du in the integrand. Write the integral in terms of u:
_paragraph_21
 u=3x2+4u=3x2+4
_paragraph_22
 du=6xdx,du=6xdx,
_paragraph_23
 Remember that du is the derivative of the expression chosen for u, regardless of what is inside the integrand. Now we can evaluate the integral with respect to u:
_paragraph_24
 Analysis
_paragraph_25
 We can check our answer by taking the derivative of the result of integration. We should obtain the integrand. Picking a value for C of 1, we let y=15(3x2+4)5+1.y=15(3x2+4)5+1. We have
_paragraph_26
 y=15(3x2+4)5+1.y=15(3x2+4)5+1.

 Solution
_paragraph_39
 Rewrite the integral as ∫z(z2−5)1/2dz.∫z(z2−5)1/2dz. Let u=z2−5u=z2−5 and du=2zdz.du=2zdz. Now we have a problem because du=2zdzdu=2zdz and the original expression has only zdz.zdz. We have to alter our expression for du or the integral in u will be twice as large as it should be. If we multiply both sides of the du equation by 12.12. we can solve this problem. Thus,
_paragraph_40
 ∫z(z2−5)1/2dz.∫z(z2−5)1/2dz.

 Sometimes we need to manipulate an integral in ways that are more complicated than just multiplying or dividing by a constant. We need to eliminate all the expressions within the integrand that are in terms of the original variable. When we are done, u should be the only variable in the integrand. In some cases, this means solving for the original variable in terms of u. This technique should become clear in the next example.

_paragraph_73
 ∫xx−1dx.∫xx−1dx.
_paragraph_74
 Solution
_paragraph_75
 If we let u=x−1,u=x−1, then du=dx.du=dx. But this does not account for the x in the numerator of the integrand. We need to express x in terms of u. If u=x−1,u=x−1, then x=u+1.x=u+1. Now we can rewrite the integral in terms of u:
_paragraph_76
 u=x−1,u=x−1,
_paragraph_77
 du=dx.du=dx.
_paragraph_78
 u=x−1,u=x−1,
_paragraph_79
 x=u+1.x=u+1.

 Then we integrate in the usual way, replace u with the original expression, and factor and simplify the result. Thus,

Substitution for Definite Integrals,"_paragraph_1
 Substitution can be used with definite integrals, too. However, using substitution to evaluate a definite integral requires a change to the limits of integration. If we change variables in the integrand, the limits of integration change as well.

_paragraph_20
 Solution
_paragraph_21
 Let u=1+2x3,u=1+2x3, so du=6x2dx.du=6x2dx. Since the original function includes one factor of x2 and du=6x2dx,du=6x2dx, multiply both sides of the du equation by 1/6.1/6. Then,
_paragraph_22
 u=1+2x3,u=1+2x3,

 du=6x2dx.du=6x2dx.

 du=6x2dx,du=6x2dx,

 To adjust the limits of integration, note that when x=0,u=1+2(0)=1,x=0,u=1+2(0)=1, and when x=1,u=1+2(1)=3.x=1,u=1+2(1)=3. Then

 Let u=4x2+3.u=4x2+3. Then, du=8xdx.du=8xdx. To adjust the limits of integration, we note that when x=0,u=3,x=0,u=3, and when x=1,u=7.x=1,u=7. So our substitution gives

 u=4x2+3.u=4x2+3.

_paragraph_48
 Substitution may be only one of the techniques needed to evaluate a definite integral. All of the properties and rules of integration apply independently, and trigonometric functions may need to be rewritten using a trigonometric identity before we can apply substitution. Also, we have the option of replacing the original expression for u after we find the antiderivative, which means that we do not have to change the limits of integration. These two approaches are shown in Example 5.36.

_paragraph_54
 Let us first use a trigonometric identity to rewrite the integral. The trig identity cos2θ=1+cos2θ2cos2θ=1+cos2θ2 allows us to rewrite the integral as

 Then,

 We can evaluate the first integral as it is, but we need to make a substitution to evaluate the second integral. Let u=2θ.u=2θ. Then, du=2dθ,du=2dθ, or 12du=dθ.12du=dθ. Also, when θ=0,u=0,θ=0,u=0, and when θ=π/2,u=π.θ=π/2,u=π. Expressing the second integral in terms of u, we have

 In the following exercises, evaluate the indefinite integral ∫f(x)dx∫f(x)dx with constant C=0C=0 using u-substitution. Then, graph the function and the antiderivative over the indicated interval. If possible, estimate a value of C that would need to be added to the antiderivative to make it equal to the definite integral F(x)=∫axf(t)dt,F(x)=∫axf(t)dt, with a the left endpoint of the given interval.

 A common mistake when dealing with exponential expressions is treating the exponent on e the same way we treat exponents in polynomial expressions. We cannot use the power rule for the exponent on e. This can be especially confusing when we have both exponentials and polynomials in the same expression, as in the previous checkpoint. In these cases, we should always double-check to make sure we’re using the right rules for the functions we’re integrating.

 Here we choose to let u equal the expression in the exponent on e. Let u=2x3u=2x3 and du=6x2dx..du=6x2dx.. Again, du is off by a constant multiplier; the original function contains a factor of 3x2, not 6x2. Multiply both sides of the equation by 1212 so that the integrand in u equals the integrand in x. Thus,

 As mentioned at the beginning of this section, exponential functions are used in many real-life applications. The number e is often associated with compounded or accelerating growth, as we have seen in earlier sections about the derivative. Although the derivative represents a rate of change or a growth rate, the integral represents the total change or the total growth. Let’s look at an example in which integration of an exponential function solves a common business application.
_paragraph_51
 A price–demand function tells us the relationship between the quantity of a product demanded and the price of the product. In general, price decreases as quantity demanded increases. The marginal price–demand function is the derivative of the price–demand function and it tells us how fast the price changes at a given level of production. These functions are used in business to determine the price–elasticity of demand, and to help companies determine whether changing production levels would be profitable.
_paragraph_52
 price–demand function
_paragraph_53
 Example
_paragraph_54
 5.40
_paragraph_55
 Find the price–demand equation for a particular brand of toothpaste at a supermarket chain when the demand is 50 tubes per week at $2.35 per tube, given that the marginal price—demand function, p′(x),p′(x), for x number of tubes per week, is given as
_paragraph_56
 p′(x),p′(x),
_paragraph_57
 If the supermarket chain sells 100 tubes per week, what price should it set?
_paragraph_58
 Solution
_paragraph_59
 To find the price–demand equation, integrate the marginal price–demand function. First find the antiderivative, then look at the particulars. Thus,
_paragraph_60
 Using substitution, let u=−0.01xu=−0.01x and du=−0.01dx.du=−0.01dx. Then, divide both sides of the du equation by −0.01. This gives
_paragraph_61
 u=−0.01xu=−0.01x
_paragraph_62
 du=−0.01dx.du=−0.01dx.
_paragraph_63
 The next step is to solve for C. We know that when the price is $2.35 per tube, the demand is 50 tubes per week. This means
_paragraph_64
 Now, just solve for C:
_paragraph_65
 Thus,
_paragraph_66
 If the supermarket sells 100 tubes of toothpaste per week, the price would be
_paragraph_67
 The supermarket should charge $1.99 per tube if it is selling 100 tubes per week.

_paragraph_72

 Again, substitution is the method to use. Let u=1−x,u=1−x, so du=−1dxdu=−1dx or −du=dx.−du=dx. Then ∫e1−xdx=−∫eudu.∫e1−xdx=−∫eudu. Next, change the limits of integration. Using the equation u=1−x,u=1−x, we have

 u=1−x,u=1−x,
_paragraph_75
 du=−1dxdu=−1dx

 −du=dx.−du=dx.
_paragraph_77

 This problem requires some rewriting to simplify applying the properties. First, rewrite the exponent on e as a power of x, then bring the x2 in the denominator up to the numerator using a negative exponent. We have
_paragraph_128
 Let u=x−1,u=x−1, the exponent on e. Then
_paragraph_129
 u=x−1,u=x−1,
_paragraph_130
 Bringing the negative sign outside the integral sign, the problem now reads
_paragraph_131
 Next, change the limits of integration:

 Notice that now the limits begin with the larger number, meaning we must multiply by −1 and interchange the limits. Thus,

 f(x)=x−1f(x)=x−1
_paragraph_3
 f(x)=lnxf(x)=lnx
_paragraph_4
 f(x)=logax,f(x)=logax,

_paragraph_25
 2x3+3xx4+3x2.2x3+3xx4+3x2.
_paragraph_26
 Solution
_paragraph_27
 This can be rewritten as ∫(2x3+3x)(x4+3x2)−1dx.∫(2x3+3x)(x4+3x2)−1dx. Use substitution. Let u=x4+3x2,u=x4+3x2, then du=4x3+6x.du=4x3+6x. Alter du by factoring out the 2. Thus,
_paragraph_28
 ∫(2x3+3x)(x4+3x2)−1dx.∫(2x3+3x)(x4+3x2)−1dx.
_paragraph_29
 u=x4+3x2,u=x4+3x2,
_paragraph_30
 du=4x3+6x.du=4x3+6x.
_paragraph_31
 Rewrite the integrand in u:
_paragraph_32
 Then we have

_paragraph_42
 log3x.log3x.
_paragraph_43
 Example 5.48 is a definite integral of a trigonometric function. With trigonometric functions, we often have to apply a trigonometric property or an identity before we can move forward. Finding the right form of the integrand is usually the key to a smooth integration.
_paragraph_44
 Example
_paragraph_45
 5.48
_paragraph_46
 Find the definite integral of ∫0π/2sinx1+cosxdx.∫0π/2sinx1+cosxdx.
_paragraph_47
 ∫0π/2sinx1+cosxdx.∫0π/2sinx1+cosxdx.
_paragraph_48
 Solution
_paragraph_49
 We need substitution to evaluate this problem. Let u=1+cosx,,u=1+cosx,, so du=−sinxdx.du=−sinxdx. Rewrite the integral in terms of u, changing the limits of integration as well. Thus,
_paragraph_50
 u=1+cosx,,u=1+cosx,,
_paragraph_51
 du=−sinxdx.du=−sinxdx.

Integrals Resulting in Other Inverse Trigonometric Functions,"_paragraph_1
 There are six inverse trigonometric functions. However, only three integration formulas are noted in the rule on integration formulas resulting in inverse trigonometric functions because the remaining three are negative versions of the ones we use. The only difference is whether the integrand is positive or negative. Rather than memorizing three more formulas, if the integrand is negative, simply factor out −1 and evaluate the integral using one of the formulas already provided. To close this section, we examine one more formula: the integral resulting in the inverse tangent function.

 Approximating Areas","_list_1
 The use of sigma (summation) notation of the form ∑i=1nai∑i=1nai is useful for expressing long sums of values in compact form.
For a continuous function defined over an interval [a,b],[a,b], the process of dividing the interval into n equal parts, extending a rectangle to the graph of the function, calculating the areas of the series of rectangles, and then summing the areas yields an approximation of the area of that region.
The width of each rectangle is Δx=b−an.Δx=b−an.
Riemann sums are expressions of the form ∑i=1nf(xi*)Δx,∑i=1nf(xi*)Δx, and can be used to estimate the area under the curve y=f(x).y=f(x). Left- and right-endpoint approximations are special kinds of Riemann sums where the values of {xi*}{xi*} are chosen to be the left or right endpoints of the subintervals, respectively.
Riemann sums allow for much flexibility in choosing the set of points {xi*}{xi*} at which the function is evaluated, often with an eye to obtaining a lower sum or an upper sum.",,

 The Definite Integral","_list_1
 The definite integral can be used to calculate net signed area, which is the area above the x-axis less the area below the x-axis. Net signed area can be positive, negative, or zero.
The component parts of the definite integral are the integrand, the variable of integration, and the limits of integration.
Continuous functions on a closed interval are integrable. Functions that are not continuous may still be integrable, depending on the nature of the discontinuities.
The properties of definite integrals can be used to evaluate integrals.

Regions Defined with Respect to y,"_paragraph_1
 In Example 6.4, we had to evaluate two separate integrals to calculate the area of the region. However, there is another approach that requires only one integral. What if we treat the curves as functions of y,y, instead of as functions of x?x? Review Figure 6.7. Note that the left graph, shown in red, is represented by the function y=f(x)=x2.y=f(x)=x2. We could just as easily solve this for xx and represent the curve by the function x=v(y)=y.x=v(y)=y. (Note that x=−yx=−y is also a valid representation of the function y=f(x)=x2y=f(x)=x2 as a function of y.y. However, based on the graph, it is clear we are interested in the positive square root.) Similarly, the right graph is represented by the function y=g(x)=2−x,y=g(x)=2−x, but could just as easily be represented by the function x=u(y)=2−y.x=u(y)=2−y. When the graphs are represented as functions of y,y, we see the region is bounded on the left by the graph of one function and on the right by the graph of the other function. Therefore, if we integrate with respect to y,y, we need to evaluate one integral only. Let’s develop a formula for this type of integration.

Then, for i=1,2,…,n,i=1,2,…,n, choose a point yi*∈[yi−1,yi],yi*∈[yi−1,yi], then over each interval [yi−1,yi][yi−1,yi] construct a rectangle that extends horizontally from v(yi*)v(yi*) to u(yi*).u(yi*).

 Now we have to determine the limits of integration. The region is bounded below by the x-axis, so the lower limit of integration is y=0.y=0. The upper limit of integration is determined by the point where the two graphs intersect, which is the point (1,1),(1,1), so the upper limit of integration is y=1.y=1. Thus, we have [c,d]=[0,1].[c,d]=[0,1].

Volume and the Slicing Method,"_paragraph_1
 Just as area is the numerical measure of a two-dimensional region, volume is the numerical measure of a three-dimensional solid. Most of us have computed volumes of solids by using basic geometric formulas. The volume of a rectangular solid, for example, can be computed by multiplying length, width, and height: V=lwh.V=lwh. The formulas for the volume of a sphere (V=43πr3),(V=43πr3), a cone (V=13πr2h),(V=13πr2h), and a pyramid (V=13Ah)(V=13Ah) have also been introduced. Although some of these formulas were derived using geometry alone, all these formulas can be obtained by using integration.

_paragraph_6
 We can also calculate the volume of a cylinder. Although most of us think of a cylinder as having a circular base, such as a soup can or a metal rod, in mathematics the word cylinder has a more general meaning. To discuss cylinders in this more general context, we first need to define some vocabulary.
_paragraph_7
 We define the cross-section of a solid to be the intersection of a plane with the solid. A cylinder is defined as any solid that can be generated by translating a plane region along a line perpendicular to the region, called the axis of the cylinder. Thus, all cross-sections perpendicular to the axis of a cylinder are identical. The solid shown in Figure 6.11 is an example of a cylinder with a noncircular base. To calculate the volume of a cylinder, then, we simply multiply the area of the cross-section by the height of the cylinder: V=A·h.V=A·h. In the case of a right circular cylinder (soup can), this becomes V=πr2h.V=πr2h.

_paragraph_11

_paragraph_12
 6.11
_paragraph_13
 Each cross-section of a particular cylinder is identical to the others.
_paragraph_14
 If a solid does not have a constant cross-section (and it is not one of the other basic solids), we may not have a formula for its volume. In this case, we can use a definite integral to calculate the volume of the solid. We do this by slicing the solid into pieces, estimating the volume of each slice, and then adding those estimated volumes together. The slices should all be parallel to one another, and when we put all the slices together, we should get the whole solid. Consider, for example, the solid S shown in Figure 6.12, extending along the x-axis.x-axis.

_paragraph_19
 We want to divide SS into slices perpendicular to the x-axis.x-axis. As we see later in the chapter, there may be times when we want to slice the solid in some other direction—say, with slices perpendicular to the y-axis. The decision of which way to slice the solid is very important. If we make the wrong choice, the computations can get quite messy. Later in the chapter, we examine some of these situations in detail and look at how to decide which way to slice the solid. For the purposes of this section, however, we use slices perpendicular to the x-axis.x-axis.

Now let P={x0,x1…,Xn}P={x0,x1…,Xn} be a regular partition of [a,b],[a,b], and for i=1,2,…n,i=1,2,…n, let SiSi represent the slice of SS stretching from xi−1toxi.xi−1toxi.

 Finally, for i=1,2,…n,i=1,2,…n, let xi*xi* be an arbitrary point in [xi−1,xi].[xi−1,xi]. Then the volume of slice SiSi can be estimated by V(Si)≈A(xi*)Δx.V(Si)≈A(xi*)Δx. Adding these approximations together, we see the volume of the entire solid SS can be approximated by

 So far, our examples have all concerned regions revolved around the x-axis,x-axis, but we can generate a solid of revolution by revolving a plane region around any horizontal or vertical line. In the next example, we look at a solid of revolution that has been generated by revolving a region around the y-axis.y-axis. The mechanics of the disk method are nearly the same as when the x-axisx-axis is the axis of revolution, but we express the function in terms of yy and we integrate with respect to y as well.

The Washer Method,"_paragraph_1
 Some solids of revolution have cavities in the middle; they are not solid all the way to the axis of revolution. Sometimes, this is just a result of the way the region of revolution is shaped with respect to the axis of revolution. In other cases, cavities arise when the region of revolution is defined as the region between the graphs of two functions. A third way this can happen is when an axis of revolution other than the x-axisx-axis or y-axisy-axis is selected.
_paragraph_2
 x-axisx-axis
_paragraph_3
 y-axisy-axis
_paragraph_4
 When the solid of revolution has a cavity in the middle, the slices used to approximate the volume are not disks, but washers (disks with holes in the center). For example, consider the region bounded above by the graph of the function f(x)=xf(x)=x and below by the graph of the function g(x)=1g(x)=1 over the interval [1,4].[1,4]. When this region is revolved around the x-axis,x-axis, the result is a solid with a cavity in the middle, and the slices are washers. The graph of the function and a representative washer are shown in Figure 6.22(a) and (b). The region of revolution and the resulting solid are shown in Figure 6.22(c) and (d).

 We can’t apply the volume formula to this problem directly because the axis of revolution is not one of the coordinate axes. However, we still know that the area of the cross-section is the area of the outer circle less the area of the inner circle. Looking at the graph of the function, we see the radius of the outer circle is given by f(x)+2,f(x)+2, which simplifies to
_paragraph_79
 f(x)+2,f(x)+2,

The Method of Cylindrical Shells,"_paragraph_1
 Again, we are working with a solid of revolution. As before, we define a region R,R, bounded above by the graph of a function y=f(x),y=f(x), below by the x-axis,x-axis, and on the left and right by the lines x=ax=a and x=b,x=b, respectively, as shown in Figure 6.25(a). We then revolve this region around the y-axis, as shown in Figure 6.25(b). Note that this is different from what we have done before. Previously, regions defined in terms of functions of xx were revolved around the x-axisx-axis or a line parallel to it.

 As we have done many times before, partition the interval [a,b][a,b] using a regular partition, P={x0,x1,…,xn}P={x0,x1,…,xn} and, for i=1,2,…,n,i=1,2,…,n, choose a point xi*∈[xi−1,xi].xi*∈[xi−1,xi]. Then, construct a rectangle over the interval [xi−1,xi][xi−1,xi] of height f(xi*)f(xi*) and width Δx.Δx. A representative rectangle is shown in Figure 6.26(a). When that rectangle is revolved around the y-axis, instead of a disk or a washer, we get a cylindrical shell, as shown in the following figure.

_paragraph_23
 To calculate the volume of this shell, consider Figure 6.27.
_paragraph_24
 Figure
_paragraph_25
 6.27
_paragraph_26
 Calculating the volume of the shell.
_paragraph_27
 The shell is a cylinder, so its volume is the cross-sectional area multiplied by the height of the cylinder. The cross-sections are annuli (ring-shaped regions—essentially, circles with a hole in the center), with outer radius xixi and inner radius xi−1.xi−1. Thus, the cross-sectional area is πxi2−πxi−12.πxi2−πxi−12. The height of the cylinder is f(xi*).f(xi*). Then the volume of the shell is
_paragraph_28
 xixi
_paragraph_29
 xi−1.xi−1.
_paragraph_30
 πxi2−πxi−12.πxi2−πxi−12.
_paragraph_31
 f(xi*).f(xi*).
_paragraph_32
 Note that xi−xi−1=Δx,xi−xi−1=Δx, so we have
_paragraph_33
 xi−xi−1=Δx,xi−xi−1=Δx,
_paragraph_34
 Furthermore, xi+xi−12xi+xi−12 is both the midpoint of the interval [xi−1,xi][xi−1,xi] and the average radius of the shell, and we can approximate this by xi*.xi*. We then have
_paragraph_35
 xi+xi−12xi+xi−12
_paragraph_36
 [xi−1,xi][xi−1,xi]
_paragraph_37
 xi*.xi*.
_paragraph_38
 Another way to think of this is to think of making a vertical cut in the shell and then opening it up to form a flat plate (Figure 6.28).
_paragraph_39
 Figure
_paragraph_40
 6.28
_paragraph_41
 (a) Make a vertical cut in a representative shell. (b) Open the shell up to form a flat plate.
_paragraph_42
 In reality, the outer radius of the shell is greater than the inner radius, and hence the back edge of the plate would be slightly longer than the front edge of the plate. However, we can approximate the flattened shell by a flat plate of height f(xi*),f(xi*), width 2πxi*,2πxi*, and thickness ΔxΔx (Figure 6.28). The volume of the shell, then, is approximately the volume of the flat plate. Multiplying the height, width, and depth of the plate, we get
_paragraph_43
 f(xi*),f(xi*),

 For the next example, we look at a solid of revolution for which the graph of a function is revolved around a line other than one of the two coordinate axes. To set this up, we need to revisit the development of the method of cylindrical shells. Recall that we found the volume of one of the shells to be given by
_paragraph_150
 This was based on a shell with an outer radius of xixi and an inner radius of xi−1.xi−1. If, however, we rotate the region around a line other than the y-axis,y-axis, we have a different outer and inner radius. Suppose, for example, that we rotate the region around the line x=−k,x=−k, where kk is some positive constant. Then, the outer radius of the shell is xi+kxi+k and the inner radius of the shell is xi−1+k.xi−1+k. Substituting these terms into the expression for volume, we see that when a plane region is rotated around the line x=−k,x=−k, the volume of a shell is given by
_paragraph_151
 xixi
_paragraph_152
 xi−1.xi−1.
_paragraph_153
 y-axis,y-axis,
_paragraph_154
 x=−k,x=−k,
_paragraph_155
 kk
_paragraph_156
 xi+kxi+k
_paragraph_157
 xi−1+k.xi−1+k.
_paragraph_158
 x=−k,x=−k,
_paragraph_159
 As before, we notice that xi+xi−12xi+xi−12 is the midpoint of the interval [xi−1,xi][xi−1,xi] and can be approximated by xi*.xi*. Then, the approximate volume of the shell is
_paragraph_160
 xi+xi−12xi+xi−12
_paragraph_161
 [xi−1,xi][xi−1,xi]
_paragraph_162
 xi*.xi*.
_paragraph_163
 The remainder of the development proceeds as before, and we see that
_paragraph_164
 We could also rotate the region around other horizontal or vertical lines, such as a vertical line in the right half plane. In each case, the volume formula must be adjusted accordingly. Specifically, the x-termx-term in the integral must be replaced with an expression representing the radius of a shell. To see how this works, consider the following example.

Arc Length of the Curve y = f(x),"_paragraph_1
 In previous applications of integration, we required the function f(x)f(x) to be integrable, or at most continuous. However, for calculating arc length we have a more stringent requirement for f(x).f(x). Here, we require f(x)f(x) to be differentiable, and furthermore we require its derivative, f′(x),f′(x), to be continuous. Functions like this, which have continuous derivatives, are called smooth. (This property comes up again in later chapters.)

 Let f(x)f(x) be a smooth function defined over [a,b].[a,b]. We want to calculate the length of the curve from the point (a,f(a))(a,f(a)) to the point (b,f(b)).(b,f(b)). We start by using line segments to approximate the length of the curve. For i=0,1,2,…,n,i=0,1,2,…,n, let P={xi}P={xi} be a regular partition of [a,b].[a,b]. Then, for i=1,2,…,n,i=1,2,…,n, construct a line segment from the point (xi−1,f(xi−1))(xi−1,f(xi−1)) to the point (xi,f(xi)).(xi,f(xi)). Although it might seem logical to use either horizontal or vertical line segments, we want our line segments to approximate the curve as closely as possible. Figure 6.37 depicts this construct for n=5.n=5.

 We can approximate the length of a curve by adding line segments.
_paragraph_22
 To help us find the length of each line segment, we look at the change in vertical distance as well as the change in horizontal distance over each interval. Because we have used a regular partition, the change in horizontal distance over each interval is given by Δx.Δx. The change in vertical distance varies from interval to interval, though, so we use Δyi=f(xi)−f(xi−1)Δyi=f(xi)−f(xi−1) to represent the change in vertical distance over the interval [xi−1,xi],[xi−1,xi], as shown in Figure 6.38. Note that some (or all) ΔyiΔyi may be negative.

 A representative line segment approximates the curve over the interval [xi−1,xi].[xi−1,xi].
_paragraph_30
 By the Pythagorean theorem, the length of the line segment is (Δx)2+(Δyi)2.(Δx)2+(Δyi)2. We can also write this as Δx1+((Δyi)/(Δx))2.Δx1+((Δyi)/(Δx))2. Now, by the Mean Value Theorem, there is a point xi*∈[xi−1,xi]xi*∈[xi−1,xi] such that f′(xi*)=(Δyi)/(Δx).f′(xi*)=(Δyi)/(Δx). Then the length of the line segment is given by Δx1+[f′(xi*)]2.Δx1+[f′(xi*)]2. Adding up the lengths of all the line segments, we get
_paragraph_31
 (Δx)2+(Δyi)2.(Δx)2+(Δyi)2.

Area of a Surface of Revolution,"_paragraph_1
 The concepts we used to find the arc length of a curve can be extended to find the surface area of a surface of revolution. Surface area is the total area of the outer layer of an object. For objects such as cubes or bricks, the surface area of the object is the sum of the areas of all of its faces. For curved surfaces, the situation is a little more complex. Let f(x)f(x) be a nonnegative smooth function over the interval [a,b].[a,b]. We wish to find the surface area of the surface of revolution created by revolving the graph of y=f(x)y=f(x) around the x-axisx-axis as shown in the following figure.

_paragraph_10
 As we have done many times before, we are going to partition the interval [a,b][a,b] and approximate the surface area by calculating the surface area of simpler shapes. We start by using line segments to approximate the curve, as we did earlier in this section. For i=0,1,2,…,n,i=0,1,2,…,n, let P={xi}P={xi} be a regular partition of [a,b].[a,b]. Then, for i=1,2,…,n,i=1,2,…,n, construct a line segment from the point (xi−1,f(xi−1))(xi−1,f(xi−1)) to the point (xi,f(xi)).(xi,f(xi)). Now, revolve these line segments around the x-axisx-axis to generate an approximation of the surface of revolution as shown in the following figure.

 Notice that when each line segment is revolved around the axis, it produces a band. These bands are actually pieces of cones (think of an ice cream cone with the pointy end cut off). A piece of a cone like this is called a frustum of a cone.
_paragraph_23
 frustum
_paragraph_24
 To find the surface area of the band, we need to find the lateral surface area, S,S, of the frustum (the area of just the slanted outside surface of the frustum, not including the areas of the top or bottom faces). Let r1r1 and r2r2 be the radii of the wide end and the narrow end of the frustum, respectively, and let ll be the slant height of the frustum as shown in the following figure.

 Since a frustum can be thought of as a piece of a cone, the lateral surface area of the frustum is given by the lateral surface area of the whole cone less the lateral surface area of the smaller cone (the pointy tip) that was cut off (see the following figure).

 Solving for s,s, we get
_paragraph_45

_paragraph_46
 Then the lateral surface area (SA) of the frustum is
_paragraph_47
 Let’s now use this formula to calculate the surface area of each of the bands formed by revolving the line segments around the x-axis.x-axis. A representative band is shown in the following figure.

_paragraph_52
 Note that the slant height of this frustum is just the length of the line segment used to generate it. So, applying the surface area formula, we have
_paragraph_53
 Now, as we did in the development of the arc length formula, we apply the Mean Value Theorem to select xi*∈[xi−1,xi]xi*∈[xi−1,xi] such that f′(xi*)=(Δyi)/Δx.f′(xi*)=(Δyi)/Δx. This gives us
_paragraph_54
 xi*∈[xi−1,xi]xi*∈[xi−1,xi]
_paragraph_55
 f′(xi*)=(Δyi)/Δx.f′(xi*)=(Δyi)/Δx.
_paragraph_56
 Furthermore, since f(x)f(x) is continuous, by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there is a point xi**∈[xi−1,xi]xi**∈[xi−1,xi] such that f(xi**)=(1/2)[f(xi−1)+f(xi)],f(xi**)=(1/2)[f(xi−1)+f(xi)], so we get
_paragraph_57
 f(x)f(x)
_paragraph_58
 xi**∈[xi−1,xi]xi**∈[xi−1,xi]
_paragraph_59
 f(xi**)=(1/2)[f(xi−1)+f(xi)],f(xi**)=(1/2)[f(xi−1)+f(xi)],
_paragraph_60
 Then the approximate surface area of the whole surface of revolution is given by
_paragraph_61
 This almost looks like a Riemann sum, except we have functions evaluated at two different points, xi*xi* and xi**,xi**, over the interval [xi−1,xi].[xi−1,xi]. Although we do not examine the details here, it turns out that because f(x)f(x) is smooth, if we let n→∞,n→∞, the limit works the same as a Riemann sum even with the two different evaluation points. This makes sense intuitively. Both xi*xi* and xi**xi** are in the interval [xi−1,xi],[xi−1,xi], so it makes sense that as n→∞,n→∞, both xi*xi* and xi**xi** approach x.x. Those of you who are interested in the details should consult an advanced calculus text.

Mass and Density,"_paragraph_1
 We can use integration to develop a formula for calculating mass based on a density function. First we consider a thin rod or wire. Orient the rod so it aligns with the x-axis,x-axis, with the left end of the rod at x=ax=a and the right end of the rod at x=bx=b (Figure 6.48). Note that although we depict the rod with some thickness in the figures, for mathematical purposes we assume the rod is thin enough to be treated as a one-dimensional object.

 We can calculate the mass of a thin rod oriented along the x-axisx-axis by integrating its density function.
_paragraph_8
 If the rod has constant density ρ,ρ, given in terms of mass per unit length, then the mass of the rod is just the product of the density and the length of the rod: (b−a)ρ.(b−a)ρ. If the density of the rod is not constant, however, the problem becomes a little more challenging. When the density of the rod varies from point to point, we use a linear density function, ρ(x),ρ(x), to denote the density of the rod at any point, x.x. Let ρ(x)ρ(x) be an integrable linear density function. Now, for i=0,1,2,…,ni=0,1,2,…,n let P={xi}P={xi} be a regular partition of the interval [a,b],[a,b], and for i=1,2,…,ni=1,2,…,n choose an arbitrary point xi*∈[xi−1,xi].xi*∈[xi−1,xi]. Figure 6.49 shows a representative segment of the rod.

 We now extend this concept to find the mass of a two-dimensional disk of radius r.r. As with the rod we looked at in the one-dimensional case, here we assume the disk is thin enough that, for mathematical purposes, we can treat it as a two-dimensional object. We assume the density is given in terms of mass per unit area (called area density), and further assume the density varies only along the disk’s radius (called radial density). We orient the disk in the xy-plane,xy-plane, with the center at the origin. Then, the density of the disk can be treated as a function of x,x, denoted ρ(x).ρ(x). We assume ρ(x)ρ(x) is integrable. Because density is a function of x,x, we partition the interval from [0,r][0,r] along the x-axis.x-axis. For i=0,1,2,…,n,i=0,1,2,…,n, let P={xi}P={xi} be a regular partition of the interval [0,r],[0,r], and for i=1,2,…,n,i=1,2,…,n, choose an arbitrary point xi*∈[xi−1,xi].xi*∈[xi−1,xi]. Now, use the partition to break up the disk into thin (two-dimensional) washers. A disk and a representative washer are depicted in the following figure.

Work Done by a Force,"_paragraph_1
 We now consider work. In physics, work is related to force, which is often intuitively defined as a push or pull on an object. When a force moves an object, we say the force does work on the object. In other words, work can be thought of as the amount of energy it takes to move an object. According to physics, when we have a constant force, work can be expressed as the product of force and distance.
_paragraph_2
 In the English system, the unit of force is the pound and the unit of distance is the foot, so work is given in foot-pounds. In the metric system, kilograms and meters are used. One newton is the force needed to accelerate 11 kilogram of mass at the rate of 11 m/sec2. Thus, the most common unit of work is the newton-meter. This same unit is also called the joule. Both are defined as kilograms times meters squared over seconds squared (kg·m2/s2).(kg·m2/s2).

_paragraph_7
 When we have a constant force, things are pretty easy. It is rare, however, for a force to be constant. The work done to compress (or elongate) a spring, for example, varies depending on how far the spring has already been compressed (or stretched). We look at springs in more detail later in this section.
_paragraph_8
 Suppose we have a variable force F(x)F(x) that moves an object in a positive direction along the x-axis from point aa to point b.b. To calculate the work done, we partition the interval [a,b][a,b] and estimate the work done over each subinterval. So, for i=0,1,2,…,n,i=0,1,2,…,n, let P={xi}P={xi} be a regular partition of the interval [a,b],[a,b], and for i=1,2,…,n,i=1,2,…,n, choose an arbitrary point xi*∈[xi−1,xi].xi*∈[xi−1,xi]. To calculate the work done to move an object from point xi−1xi−1 to point xi,xi, we assume the force is roughly constant over the interval, and use F(xi*)F(xi*) to approximate the force. The work done over the interval [xi−1,xi],[xi−1,xi], then, is given by

 Taking the limit of this expression as n→∞n→∞ gives us the exact value for work:

 Thus, we can define work as follows.

 Note that if F is constant, the integral evaluates to F·(b−a)=F·d,F·(b−a)=F·d, which is the formula we stated at the beginning of this section.
_paragraph_33
 F·(b−a)=F·d,F·(b−a)=F·d,
_paragraph_34
 Now let’s look at the specific example of the work done to compress or elongate a spring. Consider a block attached to a horizontal spring. The block moves back and forth as the spring stretches and compresses. Although in the real world we would have to account for the force of friction between the block and the surface on which it is resting, we ignore friction here and assume the block is resting on a frictionless surface. When the spring is at its natural length (at rest), the system is said to be at equilibrium. In this state, the spring is neither elongated nor compressed, and in this equilibrium position the block does not move until some force is introduced. We orient the system such that x=0x=0 corresponds to the equilibrium position (see the following figure).

 According to Hooke’s law, the force required to compress or stretch a spring from an equilibrium position is given by F(x)=kx,F(x)=kx, for some constant k.k. The value of kk depends on the physical characteristics of the spring. The constant kk is called the spring constant and is always positive. We can use this information to calculate the work done to compress or elongate a spring, as shown in the following example.

Work Done in Pumping,"_paragraph_1
 Consider the work done to pump water (or some other liquid) out of a tank. Pumping problems are a little more complicated than spring problems because many of the calculations depend on the shape and size of the tank. In addition, instead of being concerned about the work done to move a single mass, we are looking at the work done to move a volume of water, and it takes more work to move the water from the bottom of the tank than it does to move the water from the top of the tank.
_paragraph_2

So, for i=0,1,2,…,n,i=0,1,2,…,n, let P={xi}P={xi} be a regular partition of the interval [2,10],[2,10], and for i=1,2,…,n,i=1,2,…,n, choose an arbitrary point xi*∈[xi−1,xi].xi*∈[xi−1,xi].

 In pumping problems, the force required to lift the water to the top of the tank is the force required to overcome gravity, so it is equal to the weight of the water. Given that the weight-density of water is 98009800 N/m3, or 62.462.4 lb/ft3, calculating the volume of each layer gives us the weight. In this case, we have

 Then, the force needed to lift each layer is

 Note that this step becomes a little more difficult if we have a noncylindrical tank. We look at a noncylindrical tank in the next example.
_paragraph_28
 We also need to know the distance the water must be lifted. Based on our choice of coordinate systems, we can use xi*xi* as an approximation of the distance the layer must be lifted. Then the work to lift the ithith layer of water WiWi is approximately

Hydrostatic Force and Pressure,"_paragraph_1
 In this last section, we look at the force and pressure exerted on an object submerged in a liquid. In the English system, force is measured in pounds. In the metric system, it is measured in newtons. Pressure is force per unit area, so in the English system we have pounds per square foot (or, perhaps more commonly, pounds per square inch, denoted psi). In the metric system we have newtons per square meter, also called pascals.
_paragraph_2

_paragraph_3
 Let’s begin with the simple case of a plate of area AA submerged horizontally in water at a depth s (Figure 6.56). Then, the force exerted on the plate is simply the weight of the water above it, which is given by F=ρAs,F=ρAs, where ρρ is the weight density of water (weight per unit volume). To find the hydrostatic pressure—that is, the pressure exerted by water on a submerged object—we divide the force by the area. So the pressure is p=F/A=ρs.p=F/A=ρs.

 By Pascal’s principle, the pressure at a given depth is the same in all directions, so it does not matter if the plate is submerged horizontally or vertically. So, as long as we know the depth, we know the pressure. We can apply Pascal’s principle to find the force exerted on surfaces, such as dams, that are oriented vertically. We cannot apply the formula F=ρAsF=ρAs directly, because the depth varies from point to point on a vertically oriented surface. So, as we have done many times before, we form a partition, a Riemann sum, and, ultimately, a definite integral to calculate the force.

 Suppose a thin plate is submerged in water. We choose our frame of reference such that the x-axis is oriented vertically, with the downward direction being positive, and point x=0x=0 corresponding to a logical reference point. Let s(x)s(x) denote the depth at point x. Note we often let x=0x=0 correspond to the surface of the water. In this case, depth at any point is simply given by s(x)=x.s(x)=x. However, in some cases we may want to select a different reference point for x=0,x=0, so we proceed with the development in the more general case. Last, let w(x)w(x) denote the width of the plate at the point x.x.

 Let’s now estimate the force on a representative strip. If the strip is thin enough, we can treat it as if it is at a constant depth, s(xi*).s(xi*). We then have
_paragraph_35
 s(xi*).s(xi*).
_paragraph_36
 Adding the forces, we get an estimate for the force on the plate:
_paragraph_37
 This is a Riemann sum, so taking the limit gives us the exact force. We obtain
_paragraph_38
 (6.13)
_paragraph_39
 Evaluating this integral gives us the force on the plate. We summarize this in the following problem-solving strategy.

 Select a frame of reference with the x-axisx-axis oriented vertically and the downward direction being positive. Select the top of the trough as the point corresponding to x=0x=0 (step 1). The depth function, then, is s(x)=x.s(x)=x. Using similar triangles, we see that w(x)=8−(8/3)xw(x)=8−(8/3)x (step 2). Now, the weight density of water is 62.462.4 lb/ft3 (step 3), so applying Equation 6.13, we obtain

Center of Mass and Moments,"_paragraph_1
 Let’s begin by looking at the center of mass in a one-dimensional context. Consider a long, thin wire or rod of negligible mass resting on a fulcrum, as shown in Figure 6.62(a). Now suppose we place objects having masses m1m1 and m2m2 at distances d1d1 and d2d2 from the fulcrum, respectively, as shown in Figure 6.62(b).

 (a) A thin rod rests on a fulcrum. (b) Masses are placed on the rod.
_paragraph_9
 The most common real-life example of a system like this is a playground seesaw, or teeter-totter, with children of different weights sitting at different distances from the center. On a seesaw, if one child sits at each end, the heavier child sinks down and the lighter child is lifted into the air. If the heavier child slides in toward the center, though, the seesaw balances. Applying this concept to the masses on the rod, we note that the masses balance each other if and only if m1d1=m2d2.m1d1=m2d2.
_paragraph_10
 m1d1=m2d2.m1d1=m2d2.
_paragraph_11
 In the seesaw example, we balanced the system by moving the masses (children) with respect to the fulcrum. However, we are really interested in systems in which the masses are not allowed to move, and instead we balance the system by moving the fulcrum. Suppose we have two point masses, m1m1 and m2,m2, located on a number line at points x1x1 and x2,x2, respectively (Figure 6.63). The center of mass, x–,x–, is the point where the fulcrum should be placed to make the system balance.

 The center of mass x–x– is the balance point of the system.
_paragraph_20
 Thus, we have
_paragraph_21
 The expression in the numerator, m1x1+m2x2,m1x1+m2x2, is called the first moment of the system with respect to the origin. If the context is clear, we often drop the word first and just refer to this expression as the moment of the system. The expression in the denominator, m1+m2,m1+m2, is the total mass of the system. Thus, the center of mass of the system is the point at which the total mass of the system could be concentrated without changing the moment.

 We can generalize this concept to find the center of mass of a system of point masses in a plane. Let m1m1 be a point mass located at point (x1,y1)(x1,y1) in the plane. Then the moment MxMx of the mass with respect to the x-axis is given by Mx=m1y1.Mx=m1y1. Similarly, the moment MyMy with respect to the y-axis is given by My=m1x1.My=m1x1. Notice that the x-coordinate of the point is used to calculate the moment with respect to the y-axis, and vice versa. The reason is that the x-coordinate gives the distance from the point mass to the y-axis, and the y-coordinate gives the distance to the x-axis (see the following figure).

Center of Mass of Thin Plates,"_paragraph_1
 So far we have looked at systems of point masses on a line and in a plane. Now, instead of having the mass of a system concentrated at discrete points, we want to look at systems in which the mass of the system is distributed continuously across a thin sheet of material. For our purposes, we assume the sheet is thin enough that it can be treated as if it is two-dimensional. Such a sheet is called a lamina. Next we develop techniques to find the center of mass of a lamina. In this section, we also assume the density of the lamina is constant.
_paragraph_2
 lamina
_paragraph_3
 Laminas are often represented by a two-dimensional region in a plane. The geometric center of such a region is called its centroid. Since we have assumed the density of the lamina is constant, the center of mass of the lamina depends only on the shape of the corresponding region in the plane; it does not depend on the density. In this case, the center of mass of the lamina corresponds to the centroid of the delineated region in the plane. As with systems of point masses, we need to find the total mass of the lamina, as well as the moments of the lamina with respect to the x- and y-axes.
_paragraph_4
 centroid
_paragraph_5
 We first consider a lamina in the shape of a rectangle. Recall that the center of mass of a lamina is the point where the lamina balances. For a rectangle, that point is both the horizontal and vertical center of the rectangle. Based on this understanding, it is clear that the center of mass of a rectangular lamina is the point where the diagonals intersect, which is a result of the symmetry principle, and it is stated here without proof.

 As with systems of point masses, to find the center of mass of the lamina, we need to find the total mass of the lamina, as well as the moments of the lamina with respect to the x- and y-axes. As we have done many times before, we approximate these quantities by partitioning the interval [a,b][a,b] and constructing rectangles.
_paragraph_19
 [a,b][a,b]
_paragraph_20
 For i=0,1,2,…,n,i=0,1,2,…,n, let P={xi}P={xi} be a regular partition of [a,b].[a,b]. Recall that we can choose any point within the interval [xi−1,xi][xi−1,xi] as our xi*.xi*. In this case, we want xi*xi* to be the x-coordinate of the centroid of our rectangles. Thus, for i=1,2,…,n,i=1,2,…,n, we select xi*∈[xi−1,xi]xi*∈[xi−1,xi] such that xi*xi* is the midpoint of the interval. That is, xi*=(xi−1+xi)/2.xi*=(xi−1+xi)/2. Now, for i=1,2,…,n,i=1,2,…,n, construct a rectangle of height f(xi*)f(xi*) on [xi−1,xi].[xi−1,xi]. The center of mass of this rectangle is (xi*,(f(xi*))/2),(xi*,(f(xi*))/2), as shown in the following figure.

 A representative rectangle of the lamina.
_paragraph_38
 Next, we need to find the total mass of the rectangle. Let ρρ represent the density of the lamina (note that ρρ is a constant). In this case, ρρ is expressed in terms of mass per unit area. Thus, to find the total mass of the rectangle, we multiply the area of the rectangle by ρ.ρ. Then, the mass of the rectangle is given by ρf(xi*)Δx.ρf(xi*)Δx.

_paragraph_45
 This is a Riemann sum. Taking the limit as n→∞n→∞ gives the exact mass of the lamina:
_paragraph_46
 n→∞n→∞
_paragraph_47
 Next, we calculate the moment of the lamina with respect to the x-axis. Returning to the representative rectangle, recall its center of mass is (xi*,(f(xi*))/2).(xi*,(f(xi*))/2). Recall also that treating the rectangle as if it is a point mass located at the center of mass does not change the moment. Thus, the moment of the rectangle with respect to the x-axis is given by the mass of the rectangle, ρf(xi*)Δx,ρf(xi*)Δx, multiplied by the distance from the center of mass to the x-axis: (f(xi*))/2.(f(xi*))/2. Therefore, the moment with respect to the x-axis of the rectangle is ρ([f(xi*)]2/2)Δx.ρ([f(xi*)]2/2)Δx. Adding the moments of the rectangles and taking the limit of the resulting Riemann sum, we see that the moment of the lamina with respect to the x-axis is
_paragraph_48
 (xi*,(f(xi*))/2).(xi*,(f(xi*))/2).
_paragraph_49

_paragraph_52
 We derive the moment with respect to the y-axis similarly, noting that the distance from the center of mass of the rectangle to the y-axis is xi*.xi*. Then the moment of the lamina with respect to the y-axis is given by
_paragraph_53
 xi*.xi*.
_paragraph_54
 We find the coordinates of the center of mass by dividing the moments by the total mass to give x–=My/mandy–=Mx/m.x–=My/mandy–=Mx/m. If we look closely at the expressions for Mx,My,andm,Mx,My,andm, we notice that the constant ρρ cancels out when x–x– and y–y– are calculated.

We won’t go through all the details of the Riemann sum development, but let’s look at some of the key steps. In the development of the formulas for the mass of the lamina and the moment with respect to the y-axis, the height of each rectangle is given by f(xi*)−g(xi*),f(xi*)−g(xi*), which leads to the expression f(x)−g(x)f(x)−g(x) in the integrands.

Its crystal-clear glass floor allows stunning views of the canyon below (see the following figure).

_paragraph_30
 The Skywalk is a cantilever design, meaning that the observation platform extends over the rim of the canyon, with no visible means of support below it. Despite the lack of visible support posts or struts, cantilever structures are engineered to be very stable and the Skywalk is no exception. The observation platform is attached firmly to support posts that extend 46 ft down into bedrock. The structure was built to withstand 100-mph winds and an 8.0-magnitude earthquake within 50 mi, and is capable of supporting more than 70,000,000 lb.
_paragraph_31
 One factor affecting the stability of the Skywalk is the center of gravity of the structure. We are going to calculate the center of gravity of the Skywalk, and examine how the center of gravity changes when tourists walk out onto the observation platform.
_paragraph_32
 The observation platform is U-shaped. The legs of the U are 10 ft wide and begin on land, under the visitors’ center, 48 ft from the edge of the canyon. The platform extends 70 ft over the edge of the canyon.
_paragraph_33
 To calculate the center of mass of the structure, we treat it as a lamina and use a two-dimensional region in the xy-plane to represent the platform. We begin by dividing the region into three subregions so we can consider each subregion separately. The first region, denoted R1,R1, consists of the curved part of the U. We model R1R1 as a semicircular annulus, with inner radius 25 ft and outer radius 35 ft, centered at the origin (see the following figure).

 We model the Skywalk with three sub-regions.

 The legs of the platform, extending 35 ft between R1R1 and the canyon wall, comprise the second sub-region, R2.R2. Last, the ends of the legs, which extend 48 ft under the visitor center, comprise the third sub-region, R3.R3. Assume the density of the lamina is constant and assume the total weight of the platform is 1,200,000 lb (not including the weight of the visitor center; we will consider that later). Use g=32ft/sec2.g=32ft/sec2.

Theorem of Pappus,"_paragraph_1
 This section ends with a discussion of the theorem of Pappus for volume, which allows us to find the volume of particular kinds of solids by using the centroid. (There is also a theorem of Pappus for surface area, but it is much less useful than the theorem for volume.)

 Theorem of Pappus for Volume
_paragraph_6
 Let R be a region in the plane and let l be a line in the plane that does not intersect R. Then the volume of the solid of revolution formed by revolving R around l is equal to the area of R multiplied by the distance d traveled by the centroid of R.
_paragraph_7
 We can prove the case when the region is bounded above by the graph of a function f(x)f(x) and below by the graph of a function g(x)g(x) over an interval [a,b],[a,b], and for which the axis of revolution is the y-axis. In this case, the area of the region is A=∫ab[f(x)−g(x)]dx.A=∫ab[f(x)−g(x)]dx. Since the axis of rotation is the y-axis, the distance traveled by the centroid of the region depends only on the x-coordinate of the centroid, x–,x–, which is

 Clearly, this does not work when n=−1,n=−1, as it would force us to divide by zero. So, what do we do with ∫1xdx?∫1xdx? Recall from the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus that ∫1x1tdt∫1x1tdt is an antiderivative of 1/x.1/x. Therefore, we can make the following definition.

General Logarithmic and Exponential Functions,"_paragraph_1
 We close this section by looking at exponential functions and logarithms with bases other than e.e. Exponential functions are functions of the form f(x)=ax.f(x)=ax. Note that unless a=e,a=e, we still do not have a mathematically rigorous definition of these functions for irrational exponents. Let’s rectify that here by defining the function f(x)=axf(x)=ax in terms of the exponential function ex.ex. We then examine logarithms with bases other than ee as inverse functions of exponential functions.
_paragraph_2

_paragraph_3
 f(x)=ax.f(x)=ax.

 a>0,a>0,
_paragraph_11
 x,x,
_paragraph_12
 y=axy=ax
_paragraph_13
 Now axax is defined rigorously for all values of x. This definition also allows us to generalize property iv. of logarithms and property iii. of exponential functions to apply to both rational and irrational values of r.r. It is straightforward to show that properties of exponents hold for general exponential functions defined in this way.

 If a≠1,a≠1, then the function axax is one-to-one and has a well-defined inverse. Its inverse is denoted by logax.logax. Then,

 y=logax.y=logax.
_paragraph_31
 x=ay.x=ay.

Exponential Growth Model,"_paragraph_1
 Many systems exhibit exponential growth. These systems follow a model of the form y=y0ekt,y=y0ekt, where y0y0 represents the initial state of the system and kk is a positive constant, called the growth constant. Notice that in an exponential growth model, we have
_paragraph_2
 y=y0ekt,y=y0ekt,
_paragraph_3
 y0y0
_paragraph_4
 kk
_paragraph_5
 (6.27)
_paragraph_6
 That is, the rate of growth is proportional to the current function value. This is a key feature of exponential growth. Equation 6.27 involves derivatives and is called a differential equation. We learn more about differential equations in Introduction to Differential Equations.
_paragraph_7
 Rule: Exponential Growth Model
_paragraph_8
 Systems that exhibit exponential growth increase according to the mathematical model

 where y0y0 represents the initial state of the system and k>0k>0 is a constant, called the growth constant.
_paragraph_11
 y0y0
_paragraph_12
 k>0k>0
_paragraph_13
 Population growth is a common example of exponential growth. Consider a population of bacteria, for instance. It seems plausible that the rate of population growth would be proportional to the size of the population. After all, the more bacteria there are to reproduce, the faster the population grows. Figure 6.79 and Table 6.1 represent the growth of a population of bacteria with an initial population of 200200 bacteria and a growth constant of 0.02.0.02. Notice that after only 22 hours (120(120 minutes), the population is 1010 times its original size!

 Exponential Growth of a Bacterial Population
_paragraph_26
 Note that we are using a continuous function to model what is inherently discrete behavior. At any given time, the real-world population contains a whole number of bacteria, although the model takes on noninteger values. When using exponential growth models, we must always be careful to interpret the function values in the context of the phenomenon we are modeling.
_paragraph_27
 Example
_paragraph_28
 6.42
_paragraph_29
 Consider the population of bacteria described earlier. This population grows according to the function f(t)=200e0.02t,f(t)=200e0.02t, where t is measured in minutes. How many bacteria are present in the population after 55 hours (300(300 minutes)? When does the population reach 100,000100,000 bacteria?

 f(t)=200e0.02t,f(t)=200e0.02t,

_paragraph_32
 (300(300

_paragraph_34
 Solution
_paragraph_35
 We have f(t)=200e0.02t.f(t)=200e0.02t. Then
_paragraph_36
 f(t)=200e0.02t.f(t)=200e0.02t.
_paragraph_37
 There are 80,68680,686 bacteria in the population after 55 hours.

 Let’s now turn our attention to a financial application: compound interest. Interest that is not compounded is called simple interest. Simple interest is paid once, at the end of the specified time period (usually 11 year). So, if we put $1000$1000 in a savings account earning 2%2% simple interest per year, then at the end of the year we have
_paragraph_52
 compound interest
_paragraph_53
 simple interest
_paragraph_54

_paragraph_55
 $1000$1000
_paragraph_56

_paragraph_57
 Compound interest is paid multiple times per year, depending on the compounding period. Therefore, if the bank compounds the interest every 66 months, it credits half of the year’s interest to the account after 66 months. During the second half of the year, the account earns interest not only on the initial $1000,$1000, but also on the interest earned during the first half of the year. Mathematically speaking, at the end of the year, we have
_paragraph_58
 66
_paragraph_59

_paragraph_60
 $1000,$1000,
_paragraph_61
 Similarly, if the interest is compounded every 44 months, we have
_paragraph_62

_paragraph_63
 and if the interest is compounded daily (365(365 times per year), we have $1020.20.$1020.20. If we extend this concept, so that the interest is compounded continuously, after tt years we have

 Now let’s manipulate this expression so that we have an exponential growth function. Recall that the number ee can be expressed as a limit:

_paragraph_69
 Based on this, we want the expression inside the parentheses to have the form (1+1/m).(1+1/m). Let n=0.02m.n=0.02m. Note that as n→∞,n→∞, m→∞m→∞ as well. Then we get
_paragraph_70
 (1+1/m).(1+1/m).
_paragraph_71
 n=0.02m.n=0.02m.

 n→∞,n→∞,

 We recognize the limit inside the brackets as the number e.e. So, the balance in our bank account after tt years is given by 1000e0.02t.1000e0.02t. Generalizing this concept, we see that if a bank account with an initial balance of $P$P earns interest at a rate of r%,r%, compounded continuously, then the balance of the account after tt years is

 If a quantity grows exponentially, the time it takes for the quantity to double remains constant. In other words, it takes the same amount of time for a population of bacteria to grow from 100100 to 200200 bacteria as it does to grow from 10,00010,000 to 20,00020,000 bacteria. This time is called the doubling time. To calculate the doubling time, we want to know when the quantity reaches twice its original size. So we have

 We know it takes the population of fish 66 months to double in size. So, if t represents time in months, by the doubling-time formula, we have 6=(ln2)/k.6=(ln2)/k. Then, k=(ln2)/6.k=(ln2)/6. Thus, the population is given by y=500e((ln2)/6)t.y=500e((ln2)/6)t. To figure out when the population reaches 10,00010,000 fish, we must solve the following equation:

Exponential Decay Model,"_paragraph_1
 Exponential functions can also be used to model populations that shrink (from disease, for example), or chemical compounds that break down over time. We say that such systems exhibit exponential decay, rather than exponential growth. The model is nearly the same, except there is a negative sign in the exponent. Thus, for some positive constant k,k, we have y=y0e−kt.y=y0e−kt.
_paragraph_2

 y=y0e−kt.y=y0e−kt.

 Let’s look at a physical application of exponential decay. Newton’s law of cooling says that an object cools at a rate proportional to the difference between the temperature of the object and the temperature of the surroundings. In other words, if TT represents the temperature of the object and TaTa represents the ambient temperature in a room, then
_paragraph_16
 Newton’s law of cooling
_paragraph_17
 TT
_paragraph_18
 TaTa
_paragraph_19
 Note that this is not quite the right model for exponential decay. We want the derivative to be proportional to the function, and this expression has the additional TaTa term. Fortunately, we can make a change of variables that resolves this issue. Let y(t)=T(t)−Ta.y(t)=T(t)−Ta. Then y′(t)=T′(t)−0=T′(t),y′(t)=T′(t)−0=T′(t), and our equation becomes
_paragraph_20
 TaTa
_paragraph_21
 y(t)=T(t)−Ta.y(t)=T(t)−Ta.
_paragraph_22
 y′(t)=T′(t)−0=T′(t),y′(t)=T′(t)−0=T′(t),
_paragraph_23
 From our previous work, we know this relationship between y and its derivative leads to exponential decay. Thus,

 One of the most common applications of an exponential decay model is carbon dating. Carbon-14Carbon-14 decays (emits a radioactive particle) at a regular and consistent exponential rate. Therefore, if we know how much carbon was originally present in an object and how much carbon remains, we can determine the age of the object. The half-life of carbon-14carbon-14 is approximately 57305730 years—meaning, after that many years, half the material has converted from the original carbon-14carbon-14 to the new nonradioactive nitrogen-14.nitrogen-14. If we have 100100 g carbon-14carbon-14 today, how much is left in 5050 years? If an artifact that originally contained 100100 g of carbon now contains 1010 g of carbon, how old is it?

 Let’s take a moment to compare the derivatives of the hyperbolic functions with the derivatives of the standard trigonometric functions. There are a lot of similarities, but differences as well. For example, the derivatives of the sine functions match: (d/dx)sinx=cosx(d/dx)sinx=cosx and (d/dx)sinhx=coshx.(d/dx)sinhx=coshx. The derivatives of the cosine functions, however, differ in sign: (d/dx)cosx=−sinx,(d/dx)cosx=−sinx, but (d/dx)coshx=sinhx.(d/dx)coshx=sinhx. As we continue our examination of the hyperbolic functions, we must be mindful of their similarities and differences to the standard trigonometric functions.

Applications,"_paragraph_1
 One physical application of hyperbolic functions involves hanging cables. If a cable of uniform density is suspended between two supports without any load other than its own weight, the cable forms a curve called a catenary. High-voltage power lines, chains hanging between two posts, and strands of a spider’s web all form catenaries. The following figure shows chains hanging from a row of posts.

_paragraph_2
 Areas between Curves","_list_1
 Just as definite integrals can be used to find the area under a curve, they can also be used to find the area between two curves.
To find the area between two curves defined by functions, integrate the difference of the functions.
If the graphs of the functions cross, or if the region is complex, use the absolute value of the difference of the functions. In this case, it may be necessary to evaluate two or more integrals and add the results to find the area of the region.
Sometimes it can be easier to integrate with respect to y to find the area. The principles are the same regardless of which variable is used as the variable of integration.",,

_paragraph_2
 Determining Volumes by Slicing","_list_1
 Definite integrals can be used to find the volumes of solids. Using the slicing method, we can find a volume by integrating the cross-sectional area.
For solids of revolution, the volume slices are often disks and the cross-sections are circles. The method of disks involves applying the method of slicing in the particular case in which the cross-sections are circles, and using the formula for the area of a circle.
If a solid of revolution has a cavity in the center, the volume slices are washers. With the method of washers, the area of the inner circle is subtracted from the area of the outer circle before integrating.",,

_paragraph_2
 Volumes of Revolution: Cylindrical Shells","_list_1
 The method of cylindrical shells is another method for using a definite integral to calculate the volume of a solid of revolution. This method is sometimes preferable to either the method of disks or the method of washers because we integrate with respect to the other variable. In some cases, one integral is substantially more complicated than the other.
The geometry of the functions and the difficulty of the integration are the main factors in deciding which integration method to use.",,

Arc Length of a Curve and Surface Area","_paragraph_1

_paragraph_2
 Arc Length of a Curve and Surface Area","_list_1
 The arc length of a curve can be calculated using a definite integral.
The arc length is first approximated using line segments, which generates a Riemann sum. Taking a limit then gives us the definite integral formula. The same process can be applied to functions of y.y.
The concepts used to calculate the arc length can be generalized to find the surface area of a surface of revolution.
The integrals generated by both the arc length and surface area formulas are often difficult to evaluate. It may be necessary to use a computer or calculator to approximate the values of the integrals.",,

 Physical Applications","_list_1
 Several physical applications of the definite integral are common in engineering and physics.
Definite integrals can be used to determine the mass of an object if its density function is known.
Work can also be calculated from integrating a force function, or when counteracting the force of gravity, as in a pumping problem.
Definite integrals can also be used to calculate the force exerted on an object submerged in a liquid.",,

_paragraph_2
 Moments and Centers of Mass","_list_1
 Mathematically, the center of mass of a system is the point at which the total mass of the system could be concentrated without changing the moment. Loosely speaking, the center of mass can be thought of as the balancing point of the system.
For point masses distributed along a number line, the moment of the system with respect to the origin is M=∑i=1nmixi.M=∑i=1nmixi. For point masses distributed in a plane, the moments of the system with respect to the x- and y-axes, respectively, are Mx=∑i=1nmiyiMx=∑i=1nmiyi and My=∑i=1nmixi,My=∑i=1nmixi, respectively.
For a lamina bounded above by a function f(x),f(x), the moments of the system with respect to the x- and y-axes, respectively, are Mx=ρ∫ab[f(x)]22dxMx=ρ∫ab[f(x)]22dx and My=ρ∫abxf(x)dx.My=ρ∫abxf(x)dx.
The x- and y-coordinates of the center of mass can be found by dividing the moments around the y-axis and around the x-axis, respectively, by the total mass. The symmetry principle says that if a region is symmetric with respect to a line, then the centroid of the region lies on the line.
The theorem of Pappus for volume says that if a region is revolved around an external axis, the volume of the resulting solid is equal to the area of the region multiplied by the distance traveled by the centroid of the region.",,

 Integrals, Exponential Functions, and Logarithms","_list_1
 The earlier treatment of logarithms and exponential functions did not define the functions precisely and formally. This section develops the concepts in a mathematically rigorous way.
The cornerstone of the development is the definition of the natural logarithm in terms of an integral.
The function exex is then defined as the inverse of the natural logarithm.
General exponential functions are defined in terms of ex,ex, and the corresponding inverse functions are general logarithms.
Familiar properties of logarithms and exponents still hold in this more rigorous context.",,

 Exponential growth and exponential decay are two of the most common applications of exponential functions.

In exponential growth, the rate of growth is proportional to the quantity present. In other words, y′=ky.y′=ky.
Systems that exhibit exponential growth have a constant doubling time, which is given by (ln2)/k.(ln2)/k.
Systems that exhibit exponential decay follow a model of the form y=y0e−kt.y=y0e−kt.
