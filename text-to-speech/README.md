# Text-to-speech
text-to-speech team works on:
- Text-to-speech system that works well for science and math text and speaks with a Ghanaian accent
- Baseline results of at least 5 state-of-the-art models
- Trained model, code, and evaluation results
  


## Introduction
The TTS API notebook allows you to create a REST API that enables you to perform speech synthesis in our Streamlit-built application. The API can be easily integrated into the Streamlit application, providing a seamless and user-friendly experience for transcribing audio. 

Note: Due to privacy issues, we show steps on how to use publicly available TTS models from CoquiTTS and do not make available the exact Ghanaian voice models used in our streamlit application

## Requirements
Before running the script, you will need to have the following:

1. A valid [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) account.
2. An authentication token provided by ngrok, which you will copy into the code.

## Setup
Follow these steps to set up the TTS API:

1. Create an account on [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to obtain your authentication token.
2. Copy the authentication token provided by ngrok and paste it into the designated section of the code. 
3. Run the entire script and copy the generated public URL.
4. Paste the URL into the "Text To Speech" section of the the API Setup Page, as shown below.
