A relation from AA to BB defines a relationship between those two sets. A function is a special type of relation in which each element of the first set is related to exactly one element of the second set. The element of the first set is called the input; the element of the second set is called the output. Functions are used all the time in mathematics to describe relationships between two sets. For any function, when we know the input, the output is determined, so we say that the output is a function of the input. For example, the area of a square is determined by its side length, so we say that the area (the output) is a function of its side length (the input). The velocity of a ball thrown in the air can be described as a function of the amount of time the ball is in the air. The cost of mailing a package is a function of the weight of the package. Since functions have so many uses, it is important to have precise definitions and terminology to study them.",

If the slope is positive, the line points upward when moving from left to right. If the slope is negative, the line points downward when moving from left to right.

Let P=(x,y)P=(x,y) be a point on the unit circle and let \u03b8\u03b8 be the corresponding angle .. Since the angle \u03b8\u03b8 and \u03b8+2\u03c0\u03b8+2\u03c0 correspond to the same point P,P, the values of the trigonometric functions at \u03b8\u03b8 and at \u03b8+2\u03c0\u03b8+2\u03c0 are the same. Consequently, the trigonometric functions are periodic functions. The period of a function ff is defined to be the smallest positive value pp such that f(x+p)=f(x)f(x+p)=f(x) for all values xx in the domain of f.f. The sine, cosine, secant, and cosecant functions have a period of 2\u03c0.2\u03c0.

                    "We can now consider one-to-one functions and show how to find their inverses. Recall that a function maps elements in the domain of ff to elements in the range of f.f. The inverse function maps each element from the range of ff back to its corresponding element from the domain of f.f. Therefore, to find the inverse function of a one-to-one function f,f, given any yy in the range of f,f, we need to determine which xx in the domain of ff satisfies f(x)=y.f(x)=y. Since ff is one-to-one, there is exactly one such value x.x. We can find that value xx by solving the equation f(x)=yf(x)=y for x.x. Doing so, we are able to write xx as a function of yy where the domain of this function is the range of ff and the range of this new function is the domain of f.f. Consequently, this function is the inverse of f,f, and we write x=f\u22121(y).x=f\u22121(y). Since we typically use the variable xx to denote the independent variable and yy to denote the dependent variable, we often interchange the roles of xx and y,y, and write y=f\u22121(x).y=f\u22121(x). Representing the inverse function in this way is also helpful later when we graph a function ff and its inverse f\u22121f\u22121 on the same axes.",

The scale is a base-10 logarithmic scale, and it can be described as follows: Consider one earthquake with magnitude R1R1 on the Richter scale and a second earthquake with magnitude R2R2 on the Richter scale. Suppose R1>R2,R1>R2, which means the earthquake of magnitude R1R1 is stronger, but how much stronger is it than the other earthquake? A way of measuring the intensity of an earthquake is by using a seismograph to measure the amplitude of the earthquake waves.

The scale is a base-10 logarithmic scale, and it can be described as follows: Consider one earthquake with magnitude R1R1 on the Richter scale and a second earthquake with magnitude R2R2 on the Richter scale. Suppose R1>R2,R1>R2, which means the earthquake of magnitude R1R1 is stronger, but how much stronger is it than the other earthquake? A way of measuring the intensity of an earthquake is by using a seismograph to measure the amplitude of the earthquake waves.

The radian measure of angle \u03b8 is the length of the arc it subtends on the unit circle. Therefore, we see that for 0<\u03b8<\u03c02,0<sin\u03b8<\u03b8.0<\u03b8<\u03c02,0<sin\u03b8<\u03b8.",

Recall that we used the slope of a secant line to a function at a point (a,f(a))(a,f(a)) to estimate the rate of change, or the rate at which one variable changes in relation to another variable. We can obtain the slope of the secant by choosing a value of xx near aa and drawing a line through the points (a,f(a))(a,f(a)) and (x,f(x)),(x,f(x)), as shown in Figure 3.3.

For example, the derivative of a position function is the rate of change of position, or velocity. The derivative of velocity is the rate of change of velocity, which is acceleration. The new function obtained by differentiating the derivative is called the second derivative. Furthermore, we can continue to take derivatives to obtain the third derivative, fourth derivative, and so on. Collectively, these are referred to as higher-order derivatives. The notation for the higher-order derivatives of y=f(x)y=f(x) can be expressed in any of the following forms:",

Later, we will see that this rule may also be extended first to rational powers of xx and then to arbitrary powers of x.x.

Consequently, we want to know how sin(x3)sin(x3) changes as xx changes. We can think of this event as a chain reaction: As xx changes, x3x3 changes, which leads to a change in sin(x3).sin(x3). This chain reaction gives us hints as to what is involved in computing the derivative of sin(x3).sin(x3). First of all, a change in xx forcing a change in x3x3 suggests that somehow the derivative of x3x3 is involved.

There are a couple of key points to note about the statement of this theorem. For the extreme value theorem to apply, the function must be continuous over a closed, bounded interval. If the interval II is open or the function has even one point of discontinuity, the function may not have an absolute maximum or absolute minimum over I.I. For example, consider the functions shown in Figure 4.13(d), (e), and (f). All three of these functions are defined over bounded intervals. However, the function in graph (e) is the only one that has both an absolute maximum and an absolute minimum over its domain. The extreme value theorem cannot be applied to the functions in graphs (d) and (f) because neither of these functions is continuous over a closed, bounded interval. Although the function in graph (d) is defined over the closed interval [0,4],[0,4], the function is discontinuous at x=2.x=2. The function has an absolute maximum over [0,4][0,4] but does not have an absolute minimum. The function in graph (f) is continuous over the half-open interval [0,2),[0,2), but is not defined at x=2,x=2, and therefore is not continuous over a closed, bounded interval. The function has an absolute minimum over [0,2),[0,2), but does not have an absolute maximum over [0,2).[0,2). These two graphs illustrate why a function over a bounded interval may fail to have an absolute maximum and/or absolute minimum.",

                    "The first derivative test provides an analytical tool for finding local extrema, but the second derivative can also be used to locate extreme values. Using the second derivative can sometimes be a simpler method than using the first derivative.",
                    "We know that if a continuous function has local extrema, it must occur at a critical point. However, a function need not have local extrema at a critical point. Here we examine how the second derivative test can be used to determine whether a function has a local extremum at a critical point. Let ff be a twice-differentiable function such that f\u2032(a)=0f\u2032(a)=0 and f\u2033f\u2033 is continuous over an open interval II containing a.a. Suppose f\u2033(a)<0.f\u2033(a)<0. Since f\u2033f\u2033 is continuous over I,I, f\u2033(x)<0f\u2033(x)<0 for all x\u2208Ix\u2208I (Figure 4.38). Then, by Corollary 3,3, f\u2032f\u2032 is a decreasing function over I.I. Since f\u2032(a)=0,f\u2032(a)=0, we conclude that for all x\u2208I,f\u2032(x)>0x\u2208I,f\u2032(x)>0 if x<ax<a and f\u2032(x)<0f\u2032(x)<0 if x>a.x>a. Therefore, by the first derivative test, ff has a local maximum at x=a.x=a. On the other hand, suppose there exists a point bb such that f\u2032(b)=0f\u2032(b)=0 but f\u2033(b)>0.f\u2033(b)>0. Since f\u2033f\u2033 is continuous over an open interval II containing b,b, then f\u2033(x)>0f\u2033(x)>0 for all x\u2208Ix\u2208I (Figure 4.38). Then, by Corollary 3,f\u20323,f\u2032 is an increasing function over I.I. Since f\u2032(b)=0,f\u2032(b)=0, we conclude that for all x\u2208I,x\u2208I, f\u2032(x)<0f\u2032(x)<0 if x<bx<b and f\u2032(x)>0f\u2032(x)>0 if x>b.x>b. Therefore, by the first derivative test, ff has a local minimum at x=b.x=b.",

If ff is the first-degree polynomial f(x)=ax+b,f(x)=ax+b, then the solution of f(x)=0f(x)=0 is given by the formula x=\u2212ba.x=\u2212ba. If ff is the second-degree polynomial f(x)=ax2+bx+c,f(x)=ax2+bx+c, the solutions of f(x)=0f(x)=0 can be found by using the quadratic formula. However, for polynomials of degree 33 or more, finding roots of ff becomes more complicated. Although formulas exist for third- and fourth-degree polynomials, they are quite complicated. Also, if ff is a polynomial of degree 55 or greater, it is known that no such formulas exist. For example, consider the function",

Therefore, we draw a horizontal line connecting (x0,x1)(x0,x1) to the point (x1,x1)(x1,x1) on the line y=x,y=x, and then draw a vertical line connecting (x1,x1)(x1,x1) to the point (x1,F(x1)).(x1,F(x1)). The output F(x1)F(x1) becomes x2.x2. Continuing in this way, we could create an infinite number of line segments. These line segments are trapped between the lines F(x)=x2+4F(x)=x2+4 and y=x.y=x. The line segments get closer to the intersection point of these two lines, which occurs when x=F(x).x=F(x). Solving the equation x=x2+4,x=x2+4, we conclude they intersect at x=8.x=8.

Rather than memorizing three more formulas, if the integrand is negative, simply factor out \u22121 and evaluate the integral using one of the formulas already provided. To close this section, we examine one more formula: the integral resulting in the inverse tangent function.",

What if we treat the curves as functions of y,y, instead of as functions of x?x? Review Figure 6.7. Note that the left graph, shown in red, is represented by the function y=f(x)=x2.y=f(x)=x2. We could just as easily solve this for xx and represent the curve by the function x=v(y)=y.x=v(y)=y. (Note that x=\u2212yx=\u2212y is also a valid representation of the function y=f(x)=x2y=f(x)=x2 as a function of y.y. However, based on the graph, it is clear we are interested in the positive square root.) Similarly, the right graph is represented by the function y=g(x)=2\u2212x,y=g(x)=2\u2212x, but could just as easily be represented by the function x=u(y)=2\u2212y.x=u(y)=2\u2212y.
