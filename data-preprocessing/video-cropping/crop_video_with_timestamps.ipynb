It is currently saved at the Data curration Folder, Path=videos/2019_2020, while the videos are saved at Technical folder, Path= Data preprocessing/Cropped Riddels. It takes two input files: an Excel file containing the timestamps and a directory containing the videos to be cropped. The script first reads the Excel file and creates a Pandas DataFrame containing the timestamps. Then, it iterates through the DataFrame and crops the corresponding videos. The cropped videos are saved in the same directory as the original videos.\n","\n","### The key points of use of this code are:\n","\n","- It can be used to crop videos based on any set of timestamps.\n","- It is easy to use and can be run from the command line.\n","- It is efficient and can crop videos quickly.\n","- Make sure to specify the path to the video you wish to crop, else, the video to be croped is to be saved in the \"videos\" folder which is the default path in this script\n","\n","The code is written in Python and uses the moviepy library. The moviepy library is a powerful library for working with videos in Python. It allows you to read, write, edit, and process videos.\n","\n","To run the code, you will need to install the *moviepy library*. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:\n","\n","                pip install moviepy\n","\n","Once you have installed the moviepy library, you can run the code by saving it as a Python file and then running it from the command line. For example, if you saved the code as crop_video.py, you could run it by running the following command:\n","\n","                python crop_video.py\n","                \n","This will crop the videos and save them in the same directory as the original videos."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":63032,"status":"ok","timestamp":1710083257275,"user":{"displayName":"Brilla AI","userId":"16132206815223357613"},"user_tz":0},"id":"mFJji0G038Zx","outputId":"36d40c1b-5ad5-4de9-8fa0-edb5e64dddb7"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Mounted at /content/drive\n"]}],"source":[]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":12,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":783,"status":"ok","timestamp":1710083266912,"user":{"displayName":"Brilla AI","userId":"16132206815223357613"},"user_tz":0},"id":"y_Ut0PmWXjiD"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Install needed library if not already installed\n","# pip install moviepy\n","\n","# Updated  16/08/2023\n","\"\"\"\n","#-------------------------------------------------------------Instructions Start---------------------------------------------------------------------------------#\n","\n","# Instructions on running the code:\n","\n","# 1.
