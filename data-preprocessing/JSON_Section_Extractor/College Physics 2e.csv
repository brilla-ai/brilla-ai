Page 1,"Science consists of the theories and laws that are the general truths of nature as well as the body of knowledge they encompass. Scientists are continually trying to expand this body of knowledge and to perfect the expression of the laws that describe it. Physics is concerned with describing the interactions of energy, matter, space, and time, and it is especially interested in what fundamental mechanisms underlie every phenomenon. The concern for describing the basic phenomena in nature essentially defines the realm of physics. Physics Physics aims to describe the function of everything around us, from the movement of tiny charged particles to the motion of people, cars, and spaceships. In fact, almost everything around you can be described quite accurately by the laws of physics. Consider a smart phone (Figure 1.3). Physics describes how electricity interacts with the various circuits inside the device. This knowledge helps engineers select the appropriate materials and circuit layout when building the smart phone. Next, consider a GPS system. Physics describes the relationship between the speed of an object, the distance over which it travels, and the time it takes to travel that distance. GPS relies on precise calculations that account for variations in the Earth's landscapes, the exact distance between orbiting satellites, and even the effect of a complex occurrence of time dilation. Most of these calculations are founded on algorithms developed by Gladys West, a mathematician and computer scientist who programmed the first computers capable of highly accurate remote sensing and positioning. When you use a GPS device, it utilizes these algorithms to recognize where you are and how your position relates to other objects on Earth. Figure 1.3 The Apple iPhone is a common smart phone with a GPS function, sophisticated camera, haptic (vibration) capabilities, and many other functions. Physics describes the way that electricity flows through the circuits of this device. Engineers use their knowledge of physics to construct an iPhone with features that consumers will enjoy. One specific feature of an iPhone is the GPS function. GPS uses physics equations to determine the driving time between two locations on a map. (credit: Tinh tế Photo/Flickr)"
Page 1,"You need not be a scientist to use physics. On the contrary, knowledge of physics is useful in everyday situations as well as in nonscientific professions. It can help you understand how microwave ovens work, why metals should not be put into them, and why they might affect pacemakers. (See Figure 1.4 and Figure 1.5.) Physics allows you to understand the hazards of radiation and rationally evaluate these hazards more easily. Physics also explains the reason why a black car radiator helps remove heat in a car engine, and it explains why a white roof helps keep the inside of a house cool. Similarly, the operation of a car’s ignition system as well as the transmission of electrical signals through our body’s nervous system are much easier to understand when you think about them in terms of basic physics. Physics is the foundation of many important disciplines and contributes directly to others. Chemistry, for example—since it deals with the interactions of atoms and molecules—is rooted in atomic and molecular physics. Most branches of engineering are applied physics. In architecture, physics is at the heart of structural stability, and is involved in the acoustics, heating, lighting, and cooling of buildings. Parts of geology rely heavily on physics, such as radioactive dating of rocks, earthquake analysis, and heat transfer in the Earth. Some disciplines, such as biophysics and geophysics, are hybrids of physics and other disciplines. Physics has many applications in the biological sciences. On the microscopic level, it helps describe the properties of cell walls and cell membranes (Figure 1.6 and Figure 1.7). On the macroscopic level, it can explain the heat, work, and power associated with the human body. Physics is involved in medical diagnostics, such as x-rays, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and ultrasonic blood flow measurements. Medical therapy sometimes directly involves physics; for example, cancer radiotherapy uses ionizing radiation. Physics can also explain sensory phenomena, such as how musical instruments make sound, how the eye detects color, and how lasers can transmit information. It is not necessary to formally study all applications of physics. What is most useful is knowledge of the basic laws of physics and a skill in the analytical methods for applying them. The study of physics also can improve your problem-solving skills. Furthermore, physics has retained the most basic aspects of science, so it is used by all of the sciences, and the study of physics makes other sciences easier to understand. Figure 1.4 The laws of physics help us understand how common appliances work. For example, the laws of physics can help explain how microwave ovens heat up food, and they also help us understand why it is dangerous to place metal objects in a microwave oven. (credit: MoneyBlogNewz) Figure 1.5 These two applications of physics have more in common than meets the eye. Microwave ovens use electromagnetic waves to heat food. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) also uses electromagnetic waves to yield an image of the brain, from which the exact location of tumors can be determined.

Page 1,"The laws of nature are concise descriptions of the universe around us; they are human statements of the underlying laws or rules that all natural processes follow. Such laws are intrinsic to the universe; humans did not create them and so cannot change them. We can only discover and understand them. Their discovery is a very human endeavor, with all the elements of mystery, imagination, struggle, triumph, and disappointment inherent in any creative effort. (See Figure 1.8 and Figure 1.9.) The cornerstone of discovering natural laws is observation; science must describe the universe as it is, not as we may imagine it to be. Figure 1.8 Isaac Newton (1642–1727) was very reluctant to publish his revolutionary work and had to be convinced to do so. In his later years, he stepped down from his academic post and became exchequer of the Royal Mint. He took this post seriously, inventing reeding (or creating ridges) on the edge of coins to prevent unscrupulous people from trimming the silver off of them before using them as currency. (credit: Arthur Shuster and Arthur E. Shipley: Britain’s Heritage of Science. London, 1917.) Figure 1.9 Marie Curie (1867–1934) sacrificed monetary assets to help finance her early research and damaged her physical well-being with radiation exposure. She is the only person to win Nobel prizes in both physics and chemistry. One of her daughters also won a Nobel Prize. (credit: Wikimedia Commons) We all are curious to some extent. We look around, make generalizations, and try to understand what we see—for example, we look up and wonder whether one type of cloud signals an oncoming storm. As we become serious about exploring nature, we become more organized and formal in collecting and analyzing data. We attempt greater precision, perform controlled experiments (if we can), and write down ideas about how the data may be organized and unified. We then formulate models, theories, and laws based on the data we have collected and analyzed to generalize and communicate the results of these experiments. A model is a representation of something that is often too difficult (or impossible) to display directly. While a model is justified with experimental proof, it is only accurate under limited situations. An example is the planetary model of the atom in which electrons are pictured as orbiting the nucleus, analogous to the way planets orbit the Sun. (See Figure 1.10.) We cannot observe electron orbits directly, but the mental image helps explain the observations we can make, such as the emission of light from hot gases (atomic spectra). Physicists use models for a variety of purposes. For example, models can help physicists analyze a scenario and perform a calculation, or they can be used to represent a situation in the form of a computer simulation. A theory is an explanation for patterns in nature that is supported by scientific evidence and verified multiple times by various groups of researchers. Some theories include models to help visualize phenomena, whereas others do not. Newton’s theory of gravity, for example, does not require a model or mental image, because we can observe the objects directly with our own senses. The kinetic theory of gases, on the other hand, is a model in which a gas is viewed as being composed of atoms and molecules. Atoms and molecules are too small to be observed directly with our senses—thus, we picture them mentally to understand what our instruments tell us about the behavior of gases. model theory A law uses concise language to describe a generalized pattern in nature that is supported by scientific evidence and repeated experiments. Often, a law can be expressed in the form of a single mathematical equation. Laws and theories are similar in that they are both scientific statements that result from a tested hypothesis and are supported by scientific evidence. However, the designation law is reserved for a concise and very general statement that describes phenomena in nature, such as the law that energy is conserved during any process, or Newton’s second law of motion, which relates force, mass, and acceleration by the simple equation F=maF=ma. A theory, in contrast, is a less concise statement of observed phenomena. For example, the Theory of Evolution and the Theory of Relativity cannot be expressed concisely enough to be considered a law. The biggest difference between a law and a theory is that a theory is much more complex and dynamic. A law describes a single action, whereas a theory explains an entire group of related phenomena. And, whereas a law is a postulate that forms the foundation of the scientific method, a theory is the end result of that process. law F=maF=ma Less broadly applicable statements are usually called principles (such as Pascal’s principle, which is applicable only in fluids), but the distinction between laws and principles often is not carefully made. Figure 1.10 What is a model? This planetary model of the atom shows electrons orbiting the nucleus. It is a drawing that we use to form a mental image of the atom that we cannot see directly with our eyes because it is too small. Models, Theories, and Laws Models, theories, and laws are used to help scientists analyze the data they have already collected. However, often after a model, theory, or law has been developed, it points scientists toward new discoveries they would not otherwise have made. The models, theories, and laws we devise sometimes imply the existence of objects or phenomena as yet unobserved. These predictions are remarkable triumphs and tributes to the power of science. It is the underlying order in the universe that enables scientists to make such spectacular predictions. However, if experiment does not verify our predictions, then the theory or law is wrong, no matter how elegant or convenient it is. Laws can never be known with absolute certainty because it is impossible to perform every imaginable experiment in order to confirm a law in every possible scenario. Physicists operate under the assumption that all scientific laws and theories are valid until a counterexample is observed. If a good-quality, verifiable experiment contradicts a well-established law, then the law must be modified or overthrown completely. The study of science in general and physics in particular is an adventure much like the exploration of uncharted ocean. Discoveries are made; models, theories, and laws are formulated; and the beauty of the physical universe is made more sublime for the insights gained. The Scientific Method Ibn al-Haytham (sometimes referred to as Alhazen), a 10th-11th century scientist working in Cairo, significantly advanced the understanding of optics and vision. But his contributions go much further. In demonstrating that previous approaches were incorrect, he emphasized that scientists must be ready to reject existing knowledge and become ""the enemy"" of everything they read; he expressed that scientists must trust only objective evidence. Al-Haytham emphasized repeated experimentation and validation, and acknowledged that senses and predisposition could lead to poor conclusions. His work was a precursor to the scientific method that we use today. As scientists inquire and gather information about the world, they follow a process called the scientific method. This process typically begins with an observation and question that the scientist will research. Next, the scientist typically performs some research about the topic and then devises a hypothesis. Then, the scientist will test the hypothesis by performing an experiment. Finally, the scientist analyzes the results of the experiment and draws a conclusion. Note that the scientific method can be applied to many situations that are not limited to science, and this method can be modified to suit the situation. scientific method Consider an example. Let us say that you try to turn on your car, but it will not start. You undoubtedly wonder: Why will the car not start? You can follow a scientific method to answer this question. First off, you may perform some research to determine a variety of reasons why the car will not start. Next, you will state a hypothesis. For example, you may believe that the car is not starting because it has no engine oil. To test this, you open the hood of the car and examine the oil level. You observe that the oil is at an acceptable level, and you thus conclude that the oil level is not contributing to your car issue. To troubleshoot the issue further, you may devise a new hypothesis to test and then repeat the process again."

Page 1,"Physics was not always a separate and distinct discipline. It remains connected to other sciences to this day. The word physics comes from Greek, meaning nature. The study of nature came to be called “natural philosophy.” From ancient times through the Renaissance, natural philosophy encompassed many fields, including astronomy, biology, chemistry, physics, mathematics, and medicine. Over the last few centuries, the growth of knowledge has resulted in ever-increasing specialization and branching of natural philosophy into separate fields, with physics retaining the most basic facets. (See Figure 1.11, Figure 1.12, and Figure 1.13.) Physics as it developed from the Renaissance to the end of the 19th century is called classical physics. It was transformed into modern physics by revolutionary discoveries made starting at the beginning of the 20th century. classical physics Figure 1.11 Over the centuries, natural philosophy has evolved into more specialized disciplines, as illustrated by the contributions of some of the greatest minds in history. The Greek philosopher Aristotle (384–322 B.C.) wrote on a broad range of topics including physics, animals, the soul, politics, and poetry. (credit: Jastrow (2006)/Ludovisi Collection) Figure 1.12 Ibn al-Haytham (965–1040) and Galileo Galilei (1564–1642) were so critical to the advancement of scientific practice and to the fields of mathematics, optics, physics, and astronomy that a later prominent scientist featured them on the cover of his major work. (credit: Johannes Hevelius (author), Adolph Boÿ (artist), J. Falck (engraver); Houghton Library, Harvard University/Wikimedia Commons) Figure 1.13 Niels Bohr (1885–1962) made fundamental contributions to the development of quantum mechanics, one part of modern physics. (credit: United States Library of Congress Prints and Photographs Division) Classical physics is not an exact description of the universe, but it is an excellent approximation under the following conditions: Matter must be moving at speeds less than about 1% of the speed of light, the objects dealt with must be large enough to be seen with a microscope, and only weak gravitational fields, such as the field generated by the Earth, can be involved. Because humans live under such circumstances, classical physics seems intuitively reasonable, while many aspects of modern physics seem bizarre. This is why models are so useful in modern physics—they let us conceptualize phenomena we do not ordinarily experience. We can relate to models in human terms and visualize what happens when objects move at high speeds or imagine what objects too small to observe with our senses might be like. For example, we can understand an atom’s properties because we can picture it in our minds, although we have never seen an atom with our eyes. New tools, of course, allow us to better picture phenomena we cannot see. In fact, new instrumentation has allowed us in recent years to actually “picture” the atom. Limits on the Laws of Classical Physics For the laws of classical physics to apply, the following criteria must be met: Matter must be moving at speeds less than about 1% of the speed of light, the objects dealt with must be large enough to be seen with a microscope, and only weak gravitational fields (such as the field generated by the Earth) can be involved. Figure 1.14 Using a scanning tunneling microscope (STM), scientists can see the individual atoms that compose this sheet of gold. (credit: Erwinrossen) Some of the most spectacular advances in science have been made in modern physics. Many of the laws of classical physics have been modified or rejected, and revolutionary changes in technology, society, and our view of the universe have resulted. Like science fiction, modern physics is filled with fascinating objects beyond our normal experiences, but it has the advantage over science fiction of being very real. Why, then, is the majority of this text devoted to topics of classical physics? There are two main reasons: Classical physics gives an extremely accurate description of the universe under a wide range of everyday circumstances, and knowledge of classical physics is necessary to understand modern physics. Modern physics itself consists of the two revolutionary theories, relativity and quantum mechanics. These theories deal with the very fast and the very small, respectively. Relativity must be used whenever an object is traveling at greater than about 1% of the speed of light or experiences a strong gravitational field such as that near the Sun. Quantum mechanics must be used for objects smaller than can be seen with a microscope. The combination of these two theories is relativistic quantum mechanics, and it describes the behavior of small objects traveling at high speeds or experiencing a strong gravitational field. Relativistic quantum mechanics is the best universally applicable theory we have. Because of its mathematical complexity, it is used only when necessary, and the other theories are used whenever they will produce sufficiently accurate results. We will find, however, that we can do a great deal of modern physics with the algebra and trigonometry used in this text. Modern physics Relativity Quantum mechanics Check Your Understanding A friend tells you they have learned about a new law of nature. What can you know about the information even before your friend describes the law? How would the information be different if your friend told you they had learned about a scientific theory rather than a law? Solution Without knowing the details of the law, you can still infer that the information your friend has learned conforms to the requirements of all laws of nature: it will be a concise description of the universe around us; a statement of the underlying rules that all natural processes follow. If the information had been a theory, you would be able to infer that the information will be a large-scale, broadly applicable generalization."

Page 2,"Table 1.1 gives the fundamental SI units that are used throughout this textbook. This text uses non-SI units in a few applications where they are in very common use, such as the measurement of blood pressure in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). Whenever non-SI units are discussed, they will be tied to SI units through conversions. Table 1.1 Fundamental SI Units It is an intriguing fact that some physical quantities are more fundamental than others and that the most fundamental physical quantities can be defined only in terms of the procedure used to measure them. The units in which they are measured are thus called fundamental units. In this textbook, the fundamental physical quantities are taken to be length, mass, time, and electric current. (Note that electric current will not be introduced until much later in this text.) All other physical quantities, such as force and electric charge, can be expressed as algebraic combinations of length, mass, time, and current (for example, speed is length divided by time); these units are called derived units. fundamental units derived units"
Page 2,"The SI unit for time, the second (abbreviated s), has a long history. For many years it was defined as 1/86,400 of a mean solar day. More recently, a new standard was adopted to gain greater accuracy and to define the second in terms of a non-varying, or constant, physical phenomenon (because the solar day is getting longer due to very gradual slowing of the Earth’s rotation). Cesium atoms can be made to vibrate in a very steady way, and these vibrations can be readily observed and counted. In 1967 the second was redefined as the time required for 9,192,631,770 of these vibrations. (See Figure 1.17.) Accuracy in the fundamental units is essential, because all measurements are ultimately expressed in terms of fundamental units and can be no more accurate than are the fundamental units themselves. second Figure 1.17 An atomic clock such as this one uses the vibrations of cesium atoms to keep time to a precision of better than a microsecond per year. The fundamental unit of time, the second, is based on such clocks. This image is looking down from the top of an atomic fountain nearly 30 feet tall! (credit: Steve Jurvetson/Flickr) The SI unit for length is the meter (abbreviated m); its definition has also changed over time to become more accurate and precise. The meter was first defined in 1791 as 1/10,000,000 of the distance from the equator to the North Pole. This measurement was improved in 1889 by redefining the meter to be the distance between two engraved lines on a platinum-iridium bar now kept near Paris. By 1960, it had become possible to define the meter even more accurately in terms of the wavelength of light, so it was again redefined as 1,650,763.73 wavelengths of orange light emitted by krypton atoms. In 1983, the meter was given its present definition (partly for greater accuracy) as the distance light travels in a vacuum in 1/299,792,458 of a second. (See Figure 1.18.) This change defines the speed of light to be exactly 299,792,458 meters per second. The length of the meter will change if the speed of light is someday measured with greater accuracy. meter Figure 1.18 The meter is defined to be the distance light travels in 1/299,792,458 of a second in a vacuum. Distance traveled is speed multiplied by time. The SI unit for mass is the kilogram (abbreviated kg); it was previously defined to be the mass of a platinum-iridium cylinder kept with the old meter standard at the International Bureau of Weights and Measures near Paris. Exact replicas of the previously defined kilogram are also kept at the United States’ National Institute of Standards and Technology, or NIST, located in Gaithersburg, Maryland outside of Washington D.C., and at other locations around the world. The determination of all other masses could be ultimately traced to a comparison with the standard mass. Even though the platinum-iridium cylinder was resistant to corrosion, airborne contaminants were able to adhere to its surface, slightly changing its mass over time. In May 2019, the scientific community adopted a more stable definition of the kilogram. The kilogram is now defined in terms of the second, the meter, and Planck's constant, h (a quantum mechanical value that relates a photon's energy to its frequency). kilogram Electric current and its accompanying unit, the ampere, will be introduced in Electric Current, Resistance, and Ohm's Law when electricity and magnetism are covered.

Page 2,"SI units are part of the metric system. The metric system is convenient for scientific and engineering calculations because the units are categorized by factors of 10. Table 1.2 gives metric prefixes and symbols used to denote various factors of 10. metric system Metric systems have the advantage that conversions of units involve only powers of 10. There are 100 centimeters in a meter, 1000 meters in a kilometer, and so on. In nonmetric systems, such as the system of U.S. customary units, the relationships are not as simple—there are 12 inches in a foot, 5280 feet in a mile, and so on. Another advantage of the metric system is that the same unit can be used over extremely large ranges of values simply by using an appropriate metric prefix. For example, distances in meters are suitable in construction, while distances in kilometers are appropriate for air travel, and the tiny measure of nanometers are convenient in optical design. With the metric system there is no need to invent new units for particular applications. The term order of magnitude refers to the scale of a value expressed in the metric system. Each power of 1010, and so forth are all different orders of magnitude. All quantities that can be expressed as a product of a specific power of 1010 are said to be of the same order of magnitude. For example, the number 800800 can be written as 8×1028×102, and the number 450450 can be written as 4.5×102.4.5×102. Thus, the numbers 800800 and 450450 are of the same order of magnitude: 102.102. Order of magnitude can be thought of as a ballpark estimate for the scale of a value.

The Quest for Microscopic Standards for Basic Units The fundamental units described in this chapter are those that produce the greatest accuracy and precision in measurement. There is a sense among physicists that, because there is an underlying microscopic substructure to matter, it would be most satisfying to base our standards of measurement on microscopic objects and fundamental physical phenomena such as the speed of light. A microscopic standard has been accomplished for the standard of time, which is based on the oscillations of the cesium atom. The standard for length was once based on the wavelength of light (a small-scale length) emitted by a certain type of atom, but it has been supplanted by the more precise measurement of the speed of light. If it becomes possible to measure the mass of atoms or a particular arrangement of atoms such as a silicon sphere to greater precision than the kilogram standard, it may become possible to base mass measurements on the small scale. There are also possibilities that electrical phenomena on the small scale may someday allow us to base a unit of charge on the charge of electrons and protons, but at present current and charge are related to large-scale currents and forces between wires.

Page 2,"It is often necessary to convert from one type of unit to another. For example, if you are reading a European cookbook, some quantities may be expressed in units of liters and you need to convert them to cups. Or, perhaps you are reading walking directions from one location to another and you are interested in how many miles you will be walking. In this case, you will need to convert units of feet to miles. Let us consider a simple example of how to convert units. Let us say that we want to convert 80 meters (m) to kilometers (km). The first thing to do is to list the units that you have and the units that you want to convert to. In this case, we have units in meters and we want to convert to kilometers. Next, we need to determine a conversion factor relating meters to kilometers. A conversion factor is a ratio expressing how many of one unit are equal to another unit. For example, there are 12 inches in 1 foot, 100 centimeters in 1 meter, 60 seconds in 1 minute, and so on. In this case, we know that there are 1,000 meters in 1 kilometer. conversion factor Now we can set up our unit conversion. We will write the units that we have and then multiply them by the conversion factor so that the units cancel out, as shown: 1.1 Note that the unwanted m unit cancels, leaving only the desired km unit. You can use this method to convert between any types of unit. Click Appendix C for a more complete list of conversion factors. Table 1.3 Approximate Values of Length, Mass, and Time Example 1.1 Suppose that you drive the 10.0 km from your school to home in 20.0 min. Calculate your average speed (a) in kilometers per hour (km/h) and (b) in meters per second (m/s). (Note: Average speed is distance traveled divided by time of travel.) First we calculate the average speed using the given units. Then we can get the average speed into the desired units by picking the correct conversion factor and multiplying by it. The correct conversion factor is the one that cancels the unwanted unit and leaves the desired unit in its place. (1) Calculate average speed. Average speed is distance traveled divided by time of travel. (Take this definition as a given for now—average speed and other motion concepts will be covered in a later module.) In equation form, 1.2 (2) Substitute the given values for distance and time. 1.3 (3) Convert km/min to km/h: multiply by the conversion factor that will cancel minutes and leave hours. That conversion factor is 60 min/hr60 min/hr 60 min/hr60 min/hr To check your answer, consider the following: (1) Be sure that you have properly cancelled the units in the unit conversion. If you have written the unit conversion factor upside down, the units will not cancel properly in the equation. If you accidentally get the ratio upside down, then the units will not cancel; rather, they will give you the wrong units as follows: 1.4 which are obviously not the desired units of km/h. (2) Check that the units of the final answer are the desired units. The problem asked us to solve for average speed in units of km/h and we have indeed obtained these units. (3) Check the significant figures. Because each of the values given in the problem has three significant figures, the answer should also have three significant figures. The answer 30.0 km/hr does indeed have three significant figures, so this is appropriate. Note that the significant figures in the conversion factor are not relevant because an hour is defined to be 60 minutes, so the precision of the conversion factor is perfect. (4) Next, check whether the answer is reasonable. Let us consider some information from the problem—if you travel 10 km in a third of an hour (20 min), you would travel three times that far in an hour. The answer does seem reasonable. There are several ways to convert the average speed into meters per second. (1) Start with the answer to (a) and convert km/h to m/s. Two conversion factors are needed—one to convert hours to seconds, and another to convert kilometers to meters. (2) Multiplying by these yields 1.5 1.6 If we had started with 0.500 km/min, we would have needed different conversion factors, but the answer would have been the same: 8.33 m/s. You may have noted that the answers in the worked example just covered were given to three digits. Why? When do you need to be concerned about the number of digits in something you calculate? Why not write down all the digits your calculator produces? The module Accuracy, Precision, and Significant Figures will help you answer these questions. Nonstandard Units While there are numerous types of units that we are all familiar with, there are others that are much more obscure. For example, a firkin is a unit of volume that was once used to measure beer. One firkin equals about 34 liters. To learn more about nonstandard units, use a dictionary or encyclopedia to research different “weights and measures.” Take note of any unusual units, such as a barleycorn, that are not listed in the text. Think about how the unit is defined and state its relationship to SI units. Check Your Understanding Some hummingbirds beat their wings more than 50 times per second. A scientist is measuring the time it takes for a hummingbird to beat its wings once. Which fundamental unit should the scientist use to describe the measurement? Which factor of 10 is the scientist likely to use to describe the motion precisely? Identify the metric prefix that corresponds to this factor of 10. Solution The scientist will measure the time between each movement using the fundamental unit of seconds. Because the wings beat so fast, the scientist will probably need to measure in milliseconds, or 10−310−3 seconds. (50 beats per second corresponds to 20 milliseconds per beat.) 10−310−3 Check Your Understanding One cubic centimeter is equal to one milliliter. What does this tell you about the different units in the SI metric system? Solution The fundamental unit of length (meter) is probably used to create the derived unit of volume (liter). The measure of a milliliter is dependent on the measure of a centimeter."

Page 3,"Science is based on observation and experiment—that is, on measurements. Accuracy is how close a measurement is to the correct value for that measurement. For example, let us say that you are measuring the length of standard computer paper. The packaging in which you purchased the paper states that it is 11.0 inches long. You measure the length of the paper three times and obtain the following measurements: 11.1 in., 11.2 in., and 10.9 in. These measurements are quite accurate because they are very close to the correct value of 11.0 inches. In contrast, if you had obtained a measurement of 12 inches, your measurement would not be very accurate. Accuracy The precision of a measurement system refers to how close the agreement is between repeated measurements (which are repeated under the same conditions). Consider the example of the paper measurements. The precision of the measurements refers to the spread of the measured values. One way to analyze the precision of the measurements would be to determine the range, or difference, between the lowest and the highest measured values. In that case, the lowest value was 10.9 in. and the highest value was 11.2 in. Thus, the measured values deviated from each other by at most 0.3 in. These measurements were relatively precise because they did not vary too much in value. However, if the measured values had been 10.9, 11.1, and 11.9, then the measurements would not be very precise because there would be significant variation from one measurement to another. precision The measurements in the paper example are both accurate and precise, but in some cases, measurements are accurate but not precise, or they are precise but not accurate. Let us consider an example of a GPS system that is attempting to locate the position of a restaurant in a city. Think of the restaurant location as existing at the center of a bull’s-eye target, and think of each GPS attempt to locate the restaurant as a black dot. In Figure 1.23, you can see that the GPS measurements are spread out far apart from each other, but they are centered close to the actual location of the restaurant at the center of the target. This indicates a low precision, high accuracy measuring system. However, in Figure 1.24, the GPS measurements are concentrated quite closely to one another, but they are far away from the target location. This indicates a high precision, low accuracy measuring system. Figure 1.23 A GPS system attempts to locate a restaurant at the center of the bull’s-eye. The black dots represent each attempt to pinpoint the location of the restaurant. The dots are spread out quite far apart from one another, indicating low precision, but they are each rather close to the actual location of the restaurant, indicating high accuracy. (credit: Dark Evil) Figure 1.24 In this figure, the dots are concentrated rather closely to one another, indicating high precision, but they are rather far away from the actual location of the restaurant, indicating low accuracy.

Page 3,"The degree of accuracy and precision of a measuring system are related to the uncertainty in the measurements. Uncertainty is a quantitative measure of how much your measured values deviate from a standard or expected value. If your measurements are not very accurate or precise, then the uncertainty of your values will be very high. In more general terms, uncertainty can be thought of as a disclaimer for your measured values. For example, if someone asked you to provide the mileage on your car, you might say that it is 45,000 miles, plus or minus 500 miles. The plus or minus amount is the uncertainty in your value. That is, you are indicating that the actual mileage of your car might be as low as 44,500 miles or as high as 45,500 miles, or anywhere in between. All measurements contain some amount of uncertainty. In our example of measuring the length of the paper, we might say that the length of the paper is 11 in., plus or minus 0.2 in. The uncertainty in a measurement, AA, is often denoted as δAδA (“delta AA”), so the measurement result would be recorded as



 A±δAA±δA. In our paper example, the length of the paper could be expressed as 11 in.±0.2.11 in.±0.2. uncertainty AA δAδA AA A±δAA±δA 11 in.±0.2.11 in.±0.2. The factors contributing to uncertainty in a measurement include: In our example, such factors contributing to the uncertainty could be the following: the smallest division on the ruler is 0.1 in., the person using the ruler has bad eyesight, or one side of the paper is slightly longer than the other. At any rate, the uncertainty in a measurement must be based on a careful consideration of all the factors that might contribute and their possible effects. Making Connections: 

Real-World Connections – Fevers or Chills? Uncertainty is a critical piece of information, both in physics and in many other real-world applications. Imagine you are caring for a sick child. You suspect the child has a fever, so you check their temperature with a thermometer. What if the uncertainty of the thermometer were 3.0ºC3.0ºC? If the child’s temperature reading was 37.0ºC37.0ºC (which is normal body temperature), the “true” temperature could be anywhere from a hypothermic 34.0ºC34.0ºC to a dangerously high 40.0ºC40.0ºC.

If a measurement AA is expressed with uncertainty, δAδA, the percent uncertainty (%unc) is defined to be AA δAδA percent uncertainty 1.7 Example 1.2 A grocery store sells 5-lb5-lb bags of apples. You purchase four bags over the course of a month and weigh the apples each time. You obtain the following measurements: 5-lb5-lb You determine that the weight of the 5-lb5-lb bag has an uncertainty of ±0.4lb±0.4lb. What is the percent uncertainty of the bag’s weight? 5-lb5-lb ±0.4lb±0.4lb First, observe that the expected value of the bag’s weight, AA, is 5 lb. The uncertainty in this value, δAδA, is 0.4 lb. We can use the following equation to determine the percent uncertainty of the weight: AA δAδA 1.8 Plug the known values into the equation: 1.9 We can conclude that the weight of the apple bag is 5lb±8%5lb±8%. Consider how this percent uncertainty would change if the bag of apples were half as heavy, but the uncertainty in the weight remained the same. Hint for future calculations: when calculating percent uncertainty, always remember that you must multiply the fraction by 100%. If you do not do this, you will have a decimal quantity, not a percent value. 5lb±8%5lb±8% There is an uncertainty in anything calculated from measured quantities. For example, the area of a floor calculated from measurements of its length and width has an uncertainty because the length and width have uncertainties. How big is the uncertainty in something you calculate by multiplication or division? If the measurements going into the calculation have small uncertainties (a few percent or less), then the method of adding percents can be used for multiplication or division. This method says that the percent uncertainty in a quantity calculated by multiplication or division is the sum of the percent uncertainties in the items used to make the calculation. For example, if a floor has a length of 4.00 m4.00 m and a width of 3.00 m3.00 m, with uncertainties of 2%2% and 1%1%, respectively, then the area of the floor is 12.0m212.0m2 and has an uncertainty of 3%3%.

Can we conclude that this week's time was faster? Solution No, the uncertainty in the stopwatch is too great to effectively differentiate between the sprint times."

Page 3,"An important factor in the accuracy and precision of measurements involves the precision of the measuring tool. In general, a precise measuring tool is one that can measure values in very small increments. For example, a standard ruler can measure length to the nearest millimeter, while a caliper can measure length to the nearest 0.01 millimeter. The caliper is a more precise measuring tool because it can measure extremely small differences in length. The more precise the measuring tool, the more precise and accurate the measurements can be. When we express measured values, we can only list as many digits as we initially measured with our measuring tool. For example, if you use a standard ruler to measure the length of a stick, you may measure it to be 36.7cm36.7cm. You could not express this value as 36.71cm36.71cm because your measuring tool was not precise enough to measure a hundredth of a centimeter. It should be noted that the last digit in a measured value has been estimated in some way by the person performing the measurement. For example, the person measuring the length of a stick with a ruler notices that the stick length seems to be somewhere in between 36.6cm36.6cm and 36.7cm36.7cm, and they must estimate the value of the last digit. Using the method of significant figures, the rule is that the last digit written down in a measurement is the first digit with some uncertainty. In order to determine the number of significant digits in a value, start with the first measured value at the left and count the number of digits through the last digit written on the right. For example, the measured value 36.7cm36.7cm has three digits, or significant figures. Significant figures indicate the precision of a measuring tool that was used to measure a value. 36.7cm36.7cm 36.71cm36.71cm 36.6cm36.6cm 36.7cm36.7cm significant figures 36.7cm36.7cm Special consideration is given to zeros when counting significant figures. The zeros in 0.053 are not significant, because they are only placekeepers that locate the decimal point. There are two significant figures in 0.053. The zeros in 10.053 are not placekeepers but are significant—this number has five significant figures. The zeros in 1300 may or may not be significant depending on the style of writing numbers. They could mean the number is known to the last digit, or they could be placekeepers. So 1300 could have two, three, or four significant figures. (To avoid this ambiguity, write 1300 in scientific notation.) Zeros are significant except when they serve only as placekeepers. Check Your Understanding Determine the number of significant figures in the following measurements: Solution (a) 1; the zeros in this number are placekeepers that indicate the decimal point (b) 6; here, the zeros indicate that a measurement was made to the 0.1 decimal point, so the zeros are significant (c) 1; the value 103103 signifies the decimal place, not the number of measured values 103103 (d) 5; the final zero indicates that a measurement was made to the 0.001 decimal point, so it is significant (e) 4; any zeros located in between significant figures in a number are also significant When combining measurements with different degrees of accuracy and precision, the number of significant digits in the final answer can be no greater than the number of significant digits in the least precise measured value. There are two different rules, one for multiplication and division and the other for addition and subtraction, as discussed below. 1. For multiplication and division: The result should have the same number of significant figures as the quantity having the least significant figures entering into the calculation. For example, the area of a circle can be calculated from its radius using A=πr2A=πr2. Let us see how many significant figures the area has if the radius has only two—say, r=1.2mr=1.2m. Then, A=πr2A=πr2 r=1.2mr=1.2m 1.10 is what you would get using a calculator that has an eight-digit output. But because the radius has only two significant figures, it limits the calculated quantity to two significant figures or 1.11 even though ππ is good to at least eight digits. ππ 2. For addition and subtraction: The answer can contain no more decimal places than the least precise measurement. Suppose that you buy 7.56-kg of potatoes in a grocery store as measured with a scale with precision 0.01 kg. Then you drop off 6.052-kg of potatoes at your laboratory as measured by a scale with precision 0.001 kg. Finally, you go home and add 13.7 kg of potatoes as measured by a bathroom scale with precision 0.1 kg. How many kilograms of potatoes do you now have, and how many significant figures are appropriate in the answer? The mass is found by simple addition and subtraction: 1.12 Next, we identify the least precise measurement: 13.7 kg. This measurement is expressed to the 0.1 decimal place, so our final answer must also be expressed to the 0.1 decimal place. Thus, the answer is rounded to the tenths place, giving us 15.2 kg. In this text, most numbers are assumed to have three significant figures. Furthermore, consistent numbers of significant figures are used in all worked examples. You will note that an answer given to three digits is based on input good to at least three digits, for example. If the input has fewer significant figures, the answer will also have fewer significant figures. Care is also taken that the number of significant figures is reasonable for the situation posed. In some topics, particularly in optics, more accurate numbers are needed and more than three significant figures will be used. Finally, if a number is exact, such as the two in the formula for the circumference of a circle, c=2πrc=2πr, it does not affect the number of significant figures in a calculation. c=2πrc=2πr Check Your Understanding Perform the following calculations and express your answer using the correct number of significant digits. (a) A woman has two bags, each weighing 13.5 pounds and one bag with a weight of 10.2 pounds. What is the total weight of the bags? (b) The force FF on an object is equal to its mass mm multiplied by its acceleration aa. If a wagon with mass 55 kg accelerates at a rate of 0.0255  m/s20.0255  m/s2, what is the force on the wagon? (The unit of force is called the newton, and it is expressed with the symbol N.) FF mm aa 0.0255  m/s20.0255  m/s2 Solution (a) 37.2 pounds; Because the number of bags is an exact value, it is not considered in the significant figures. (b) 1.4 N; Because the value 55 kg has only two significant figures, the final value must also contain two significant figures."

Page 10,"In order to describe the motion of an object, you must first be able to describe its position—where it is at any particular time. More precisely, you need to specify its position relative to a convenient reference frame. Earth is often used as a reference frame, and we often describe the position of an object as it relates to stationary objects in that reference frame. For example, a rocket launch would be described in terms of the position of the rocket with respect to the Earth as a whole, while a professor’s position could be described in terms of where she is in relation to the nearby white board. (See Figure 2.3.) In other cases, we use reference frames that are not stationary but are in motion relative to the Earth. To describe the position of a person in an airplane, for example, we use the airplane, not the Earth, as the reference frame. (See Figure 2.4.) position"
Page 10,"If an object moves relative to a reference frame (for example, if a professor moves to the right relative to a white board or a passenger moves toward the rear of an airplane), then the object’s position changes. This change in position is known as displacement. The word “displacement” implies that an object has moved, or has been displaced. displacement Displacement Displacement is the change in position of an object: 2.1 where ΔxΔx is displacement, xfxf is the final position, and x0x0 is the initial position. ΔxΔx xfxf x0x0 In this text the upper case Greek letter ΔΔ (delta) always means “change in” whatever quantity follows it; thus, ΔxΔx means change in position. Always solve for displacement by subtracting initial position x0x0 from final position xfxf. ΔΔ ΔxΔx x0x0 xfxf Note that the SI unit for displacement is the meter (m) (see Physical Quantities and Units), but sometimes kilometers, miles, feet, and other units of length are used. Keep in mind that when units other than the meter are used in a problem, you may need to convert them into meters to complete the calculation. Figure 2.3 A professor paces left and right while lecturing. Her position relative to Earth is given by xx. The +2.0m+2.0m displacement of the professor relative to Earth is represented by an arrow pointing to the right. Figure 2.4 A passenger moves from his seat to the back of the plane. His location relative to the airplane is given by xx. The −4.0-m−4.0-m displacement of the passenger relative to the plane is represented by an arrow toward the rear of the plane. Notice that the arrow representing his displacement is twice as long as the arrow representing the displacement of the professor (he moves twice as far) in Figure 2.3. Note that displacement has a direction as well as a magnitude. The professor’s displacement is 2.0 m to the right, and the airline passenger’s displacement is 4.0 m toward the rear. In one-dimensional motion, direction can be specified with a plus or minus sign. When you begin a problem, you should select which direction is positive (usually that will be to the right or up, but you are free to select positive as being any direction). The professor’s initial position is x0=1.5mx0=1.5m and her final position is xf=3.5mxf=3.5m. Thus her displacement is x0=1.5mx0=1.5m xf=3.5mxf=3.5m 2.2 In this coordinate system, motion to the right is positive, whereas motion to the left is negative. Similarly, the airplane passenger’s initial position is x0=6.0 mx0=6.0 m and his final position is xf=2.0 mxf=2.0 m, so his displacement is x0=6.0 mx0=6.0 m xf=2.0 mxf=2.0 m 2.3 His displacement is negative because his motion is toward the rear of the plane, or in the negative xx direction in our coordinate system. xx"

Page 10,"Although displacement is described in terms of direction, distance is not. Distance is defined to be the magnitude or size of displacement between two positions. Note that the distance between two positions is not the same as the distance traveled between them. Distance traveled is the total length of the path traveled between two positions. Distance has no direction and, thus, no sign. For example, the distance the professor walks is 2.0 m. The distance the airplane passenger walks is 4.0 m. Distance Distance traveled Misconception Alert: Distance Traveled vs. Magnitude of Displacement It is important to note that the distance traveled, however, can be greater than the magnitude of the displacement (by magnitude, we mean just the size of the displacement without regard to its direction; that is, just a number with a unit). For example, the professor could pace back and forth many times, perhaps walking a distance of 150 m during a lecture, yet still end up only 2.0 m to the right of her starting point. In this case her displacement would be +2.0 m, the magnitude of her displacement would be 2.0 m, but the distance she traveled would be 150 m. In kinematics we nearly always deal with displacement and magnitude of displacement, and almost never with distance traveled. One way to think about this is to assume you marked the start of the motion and the end of the motion. The displacement is simply the difference in the position of the two marks and is independent of the path taken in traveling between the two marks. The distance traveled, however, is the total length of the path taken between the two marks. Check Your Understanding A cyclist rides 3 km west and then turns around and rides 2 km east.

Page 11,"In order to describe the direction of a vector quantity, you must designate a coordinate system within the reference frame. For one-dimensional motion, this is a simple coordinate system consisting of a one-dimensional coordinate line. In general, when describing horizontal motion, motion to the right is usually considered positive, and motion to the left is considered negative. With vertical motion, motion up is usually positive and motion down is negative. In some cases, however, as with the jet in Figure 2.6, it can be more convenient to switch the positive and negative directions. For example, if you are analyzing the motion of falling objects, it can be useful to define downwards as the positive direction. If people in a race are running to the left, it is useful to define left as the positive direction. It does not matter as long as the system is clear and consistent. Once you assign a positive direction and start solving a problem, you cannot change it. Figure 2.7 It is usually convenient to consider motion upward or to the right as positive

Page 12,"As discussed in Physical Quantities and Units, the most fundamental physical quantities are defined by how they are measured. This is the case with time. Every measurement of time involves measuring a change in some physical quantity. It may be a number on a digital clock, a heartbeat, or the position of the Sun in the sky. In physics, the definition of time is simple—time is change, or the interval over which change occurs. It is impossible to know that time has passed unless something changes. time The amount of time or change is calibrated by comparison with a standard. The SI unit for time is the second, abbreviated s. We might, for example, observe that a certain pendulum makes one full swing every 0.75 s. We could then use the pendulum to measure time by counting its swings or, of course, by connecting the pendulum to a clock mechanism that registers time on a dial. This allows us to not only measure the amount of time, but also to determine a sequence of events. How does time relate to motion? We are usually interested in elapsed time for a particular motion, such as how long it takes an airplane passenger to get from his seat to the back of the plane. To find elapsed time, we note the time at the beginning and end of the motion and subtract the two. For example, a lecture may start at 11:00 A.M. and end at 11:50 A.M., so that the elapsed time would be 50 min. Elapsed time ΔtΔt is the difference between the ending time and beginning time, A.M. A.M. Elapsed time ΔtΔt 2.4 where ΔtΔt is the change in time or elapsed time, tftf is the time at the end of the motion, and t0t0 is the time at the beginning of the motion. (As usual, the delta symbol, ΔΔ, means the change in the quantity that follows it.) ΔtΔt tftf t0t0 ΔΔ Life is simpler if the beginning time t0t0 is taken to be zero, as when we use a stopwatch. If we were using a stopwatch, it would simply read zero at the start of the lecture and 50 min at the end.

Page 12,"Your notion of velocity is probably the same as its scientific definition. You know that if you have a large displacement in a small amount of time you have a large velocity, and that velocity has units of distance divided by time, such as miles per hour or kilometers per hour. Average Velocity Average velocity is displacement (change in position) divided by the time of travel, Average velocity 2.5 where v-v- is the average (indicated by the bar over the vv) velocity, ΔxΔx is the change in position (or displacement), and xfxf and x0x0 are the final and beginning positions at times tftf and t0t0, respectively. If the starting time t0t0 is taken to be zero, then the average velocity is simply v-v- vv ΔxΔx xfxf x0x0 tftf t0t0 t0t0 2.6 Notice that this definition indicates that velocity is a vector because displacement is a vector. It has both magnitude and direction. The SI unit for velocity is meters per second or m/s, but many other units, such as km/h, mi/h (also written as mph), and cm/s, are in common use. Suppose, for example, an airplane passenger took 5 seconds to move −4 m (the negative sign indicates that displacement is toward the back of the plane). His average velocity would be 2.7 The minus sign indicates the average velocity is also toward the rear of the plane. The average velocity of an object does not tell us anything about what happens to it between the starting point and ending point, however. For example, we cannot tell from average velocity whether the airplane passenger stops momentarily or backs up before he goes to the back of the plane. To get more details, we must consider smaller segments of the trip over smaller time intervals. Figure 2.9 A more detailed record of an airplane passenger heading toward the back of the plane, showing smaller segments of his trip. The smaller the time intervals considered in a motion, the more detailed the information. When we carry this process to its logical conclusion, we are left with an infinitesimally small interval. Over such an interval, the average velocity becomes the instantaneous velocity or the velocity at a specific instant. A car’s speedometer, for example, shows the magnitude (but not the direction) of the instantaneous velocity of the car. (Police give tickets based on instantaneous velocity, but when calculating how long it will take to get from one place to another on a road trip, you need to use average velocity.) Instantaneous velocity vv is the average velocity at a specific instant in time (or over an infinitesimally small time interval). Instantaneous velocity vv Mathematically, finding instantaneous velocity, vv, at a precise instant tt can involve taking a limit, a calculus operation beyond the scope of this text. However, under many circumstances, we can find precise values for instantaneous velocity without calculus. vv tt"

Page 12,"In everyday language, most people use the terms “speed” and “velocity” interchangeably. In physics, however, they do not have the same meaning and they are distinct concepts. One major difference is that speed has no direction. Thus speed is a scalar. Just as we need to distinguish between instantaneous velocity and average velocity, we also need to distinguish between instantaneous speed and average speed. Instantaneous speed is the magnitude of instantaneous velocity. For example, suppose the airplane passenger at one instant had an instantaneous velocity of −3.0 m/s (the minus meaning toward the rear of the plane). At that same time his instantaneous speed was 3.0 m/s. Or suppose that at one time during a shopping trip your instantaneous velocity is 40 km/h due north. Your instantaneous speed at that instant would be 40 km/h—the same magnitude but without a direction. Average speed, however, is very different from average velocity. Average speed is the distance traveled divided by elapsed time. Instantaneous speed Average speed We have noted that distance traveled can be greater than the magnitude of displacement. So average speed can be greater than average velocity, which is displacement divided by time. For example, if you drive to a store and return home in half an hour, and your car’s odometer shows the total distance traveled was 6 km, then your average speed was 12 km/h. Your average velocity, however, was zero, because your displacement for the round trip is zero. (Displacement is change in position and, thus, is zero for a round trip.) Thus average speed is not simply the magnitude of average velocity. Figure 2.10 During a 30-minute round trip to the store, the total distance traveled is 6 km. The average speed is 12 km/h. The displacement for the round trip is zero, since there was no net change in position. Thus the average velocity is zero. Another way of visualizing the motion of an object is to use a graph. A plot of position or of velocity as a function of time can be very useful. For example, for this trip to the store, the position, velocity, and speed-vs.-time graphs are displayed in Figure 2.11. (Note that these graphs depict a very simplified model of the trip. We are assuming that speed is constant during the trip, which is unrealistic given that we’ll probably stop at the store. But for simplicity’s sake, we will model it with no stops or changes in speed. We are also assuming that the route between the store and the house is a perfectly straight line.) model Figure 2.11 Position vs. time, velocity vs. time, and speed vs. time on a trip. Note that the velocity for the return trip is negative. Making Connections: Take-Home Investigation—Getting a Sense of Speed If you have spent much time driving, you probably have a good sense of speeds between about 10 and 70 miles per hour. But what are these in meters per second? What do we mean when we say that something is moving at 10 m/s? To get a better sense of what these values really mean, do some observations and calculations on your own: Check Your Understanding A commuter train travels from Baltimore to Washington, DC, and back in 1 hour and 45 minutes. The distance between the two stations is approximately 40 miles. What is (a) the average velocity of the train, and (b) the average speed of the train in m/s? Solution (a) The average velocity of the train is zero because xf=x0xf=x0; the train ends up at the same place it starts. xf=x0xf=x0 (b) The average speed of the train is calculated below. Note that the train travels 40 miles one way and 40 miles back, for a total distance of 80 miles. 2.8 2.9"

Page 13,"Average Acceleration is the rate at which velocity changes, Average Acceleration 2.10 where a-a- is average acceleration, vv is velocity, and tt is time. (The bar over the aa means average acceleration.) a-a- vv tt aa"
Page 13,"Instantaneous acceleration aa, or the acceleration at a specific instant in time, is obtained by the same process as discussed for instantaneous velocity in Time, Velocity, and Speed—that is, by considering an infinitesimally small interval of time. How do we find instantaneous acceleration using only algebra? The answer is that we choose an average acceleration that is representative of the motion. Figure 2.17 shows graphs of instantaneous acceleration versus time for two very different motions. In Figure 2.17(a), the acceleration varies slightly and the average over the entire interval is nearly the same as the instantaneous acceleration at any time. In this case, we should treat this motion as if it had a constant acceleration equal to the average (in this case about 1.8 m/s21.8 m/s2). In Figure 2.17(b), the acceleration varies drastically over time. In such situations it is best to consider smaller time intervals and choose an average acceleration for each. For example, we could consider motion over the time intervals from 0 to 1.0 s and from 1.0 to 3.0 s as separate motions with accelerations of +3.0 m/s2+3.0 m/s2 and –2.0 m/s2–2.0 m/s2, respectively.

(a) Here acceleration varies only slightly and is always in the same direction, since it is positive. The average over the interval is nearly the same as the acceleration at any given time. (b) Here the acceleration varies greatly, perhaps representing a package on a post office conveyor belt that is accelerated forward and backward as it bumps along. It is necessary to consider small time intervals (such as from 0 to 1.0 s) with constant or nearly constant acceleration in such a situation. The next several examples consider the motion of the subway train shown in Figure 2.18. In (a) the shuttle moves to the right, and in (b) it moves to the left. The examples are designed to further illustrate aspects of motion and to illustrate some of the reasoning that goes into solving problems. Figure 2.18 One-dimensional motion of a subway train considered in Example 2.2, Example 2.3, Example 2.4, Example 2.5, Example 2.6, and Example 2.7. Here we have chosen the xx-axis so that + means to the right and −− means to the left for displacements, velocities, and accelerations. (a) The subway train moves to the right from x0x0 to

x′fx′f. Its displacement Δx′Δx′ is −1.5 km−1.5 km. (Note that the prime symbol (′) is used simply to distinguish between displacement in the two different situations. The distances of travel and the size of the cars are on different scales to fit everything into the diagram.) Example 2.2 What are the magnitude and sign of displacements for the motions of the subway train shown in parts (a) and (b) of Figure 2.18? A drawing with a coordinate system is already provided, so we don’t need to make a sketch, but we should analyze it to make sure we understand what it is showing. Pay particular attention to the coordinate system. To find displacement, we use the equation Δx=xf−x0Δx=xf−x0. This is straightforward since the initial and final positions are given. Δx=xf−x0Δx=xf−x0 1. Identify the knowns. In the figure we see that xf=6.70 kmxf=6.70 km and
x0=4.70 kmx0=4.70 km for part (a), and x′f=3.75 kmx′f=3.75 km and x′0=5.25 kmx′0=5.25 km for part (b). xf=6.70 kmxf=6.70 km x0=4.70 kmx0=4.70 km x′f=3.75 kmx′f=3.75 km x′0=5.25 kmx′0=5.25 km 2. Solve for displacement in part (a). 2.12 3. Solve for displacement in part (b). 2.13 The direction of the motion in (a) is to the right and therefore its displacement has a positive sign, whereas motion in (b) is to the left and thus has a negative sign. Example 2.3 What are the distances traveled for the motions shown in parts (a) and (b) of the subway train in Figure 2.18? To answer this question, think about the definitions of distance and distance traveled, and how they are related to displacement. Distance between two positions is defined to be the magnitude of displacement, which was found in Example 2.2. Distance traveled is the total length of the path traveled between the two positions. (See Displacement.) In the case of the subway train shown in Figure 2.18, the distance traveled is the same as the distance between the initial and final positions of the train. 1. The displacement for part (a) was +2.00 km. Therefore, the distance between the initial and final positions was 2.00 km, and the distance traveled was 2.00 km. 2. The displacement for part (b) was −1.5 km.−1.5 km. Therefore, the distance between the initial and final positions was 1.50 km, and the distance traveled was 1.50 km. −1.5 km.−1.5 km. Distance is a scalar. It has magnitude but no sign to indicate direction. Example 2.4 Suppose the train in Figure 2.18(a) accelerates from rest to 30.0 km/h in the first 20.0 s of its motion. What is its average acceleration during that time interval? It is worth it at this point to make a simple sketch: Figure 2.19 This problem involves three steps. First we must determine the change in velocity, then we must determine the change in time, and finally we use these values to calculate the acceleration. 1. Identify the knowns. v0=0v0=0 (the trains starts at rest), vf=30.0 km/hvf=30.0 km/h, and Δt=20.0 sΔt=20.0 s. v0=0v0=0 vf=30.0 km/hvf=30.0 km/h Δt=20.0 sΔt=20.0 s 2. Calculate ΔvΔv. Since the train starts from rest, its change in velocity is Δv=+30.0 km/hΔv=+30.0 km/h, where the plus sign means velocity to the right. ΔvΔv Δv=+30.0 km/hΔv=+30.0 km/h 3. Plug in known values and solve for the unknown, a-a-. a-a- 2.14 4. Since the units are mixed (we have both hours and seconds for time), we need to convert everything into SI units of meters and seconds. (See Physical Quantities and Units for more guidance.) 2.15 The plus sign means that acceleration is to the right. This is reasonable because the train starts from rest and ends up with a velocity to the right (also positive). So acceleration is in the same direction as the change in velocity, as is always the case. Example 2.5 Now suppose that at the end of its trip, the train in Figure 2.18(a) slows to a stop from a speed of 30.0 km/h in 8.00 s. What is its average acceleration while stopping? Figure 2.20 In this case, the train is decelerating and its acceleration is negative because it is toward the left. As in the previous example, we must find the change in velocity and the change in time and then solve for acceleration. 1. Identify the knowns. v0=30.0 km/hv0=30.0 km/h, vf=0 km/hvf=0 km/h (the train is stopped, so its velocity is 0), and Δt=8.00 sΔt=8.00 s. v0=30.0 km/hv0=30.0 km/h vf=0 km/hvf=0 km/h Δt=8.00 sΔt=8.00 s 2. Solve for the change in velocity, ΔvΔv. ΔvΔv 2.16 3. Plug in the knowns, ΔvΔv and ΔtΔt, and solve for a-a-. ΔvΔv ΔtΔt a-a- 2.17 4. Convert the units to meters and seconds. 2.18 The minus sign indicates that acceleration is to the left. This sign is reasonable because the train initially has a positive velocity in this problem, and a negative acceleration would oppose the motion. Again, acceleration is in the same direction as the change in velocity, which is negative here. This acceleration can be called a deceleration because it has a direction opposite to the velocity. The graphs of position, velocity, and acceleration vs. time for the trains in Example 2.4 and Example 2.5 are displayed in Figure 2.21. (We have taken the velocity to remain constant from 20 to 40 s, after which the train decelerates.) Figure 2.21 (a) Position of the train over time. Notice that the train’s position changes slowly at the beginning of the journey, then more and more quickly as it picks up speed. Its position then changes more slowly as it slows down at the end of the journey. In the middle of the journey, while the velocity remains constant, the position changes at a constant rate. (b) Velocity of the train over time. The train’s velocity increases as it accelerates at the beginning of the journey. It remains the same in the middle of the journey (where there is no acceleration). It decreases as the train decelerates at the end of the journey. (c) The acceleration of the train over time. The train has positive acceleration as it speeds up at the beginning of the journey. It has no acceleration as it travels at constant velocity in the middle of the journey. Its acceleration is negative as it slows down at the end of the journey. Example 2.6 What is the average velocity of the train in part b of Example 2.2, and shown again below, if it takes 5.00 min to make its trip? Figure 2.22 Average velocity is displacement divided by time. It will be negative here, since the train moves to the left and has a negative displacement. 1. Identify the knowns. x′f=3.75 kmx′f=3.75 km, x′0=5.25 kmx′0=5.25 km, Δt=5.00 minΔt=5.00 min. x′f=3.75 kmx′f=3.75 km x′0=5.25 kmx′0=5.25 km Δt=5.00 minΔt=5.00 min 2. Determine displacement, Δx′Δx′. We found Δx′Δx′ to be −1.5 km−1.5 km in Example 2.2. Δx′Δx′ Δx′Δx′ −1.5 km−1.5 km 3. Solve for average velocity. 2.19 4. Convert units. 2.20 The negative velocity indicates motion to the left. Example 2.7 Finally, suppose the train in Figure 2.22 slows to a stop from a velocity of 20.0 km/h in 10.0 s. What is its average acceleration? Once again, let’s draw a sketch: Figure 2.23 As before, we must find the change in velocity and the change in time to calculate average acceleration. 1. Identify the knowns. v0=−20 km/hv0=−20 km/h,
vf=0 km/hvf=0 km/h,
Δt=10.0 sΔt=10.0 s. v0=−20 km/hv0=−20 km/h vf=0 km/hvf=0 km/h Δt=10.0 sΔt=10.0 s 2. Calculate ΔvΔv. The change in velocity here is actually positive, since ΔvΔv 2.21 3. Solve for a-a-. a-a- 2.22 4. Convert units. 2.23 The plus sign means that acceleration is to the right. This is reasonable because the train initially has a negative velocity (to the left) in this problem and a positive acceleration opposes the motion (and so it is to the right). Again, acceleration is in the same direction as the change in velocity, which is positive here. As in Example 2.5, this acceleration can be called a deceleration since it is in the direction opposite to the velocity."
Page 13,"Perhaps the most important thing to note about these examples is the signs of the answers. In our chosen coordinate system, plus means the quantity is to the right and minus means it is to the left. This is easy to imagine for displacement and velocity. But it is a little less obvious for acceleration. Most people interpret negative acceleration as the slowing of an object. This was not the case in Example 2.7, where a positive acceleration slowed a negative velocity. The crucial distinction was that the acceleration was in the opposite direction from the velocity. In fact, a negative acceleration will increase a negative velocity. For example, the train moving to the left in Figure 2.22 is sped up by an acceleration to the left. In that case, both vv and aa are negative. The plus and minus signs give the directions of the accelerations. If acceleration has the same sign as the velocity, the object is speeding up. If acceleration has the opposite sign as the velocity, the object is slowing down. vv aa Check Your Understanding An airplane lands on a runway traveling east. Describe its acceleration. Solution If we take east to be positive, then the airplane has negative acceleration, as it is accelerating toward the west. It is also decelerating: its acceleration is opposite in direction to its velocity. PhET Explorations Moving Man Simulation Learn about position, velocity, and acceleration graphs.

Page 14,"First, let us make some simplifications in notation. Taking the initial time to be zero, as if time is measured with a stopwatch, is a great simplification. Since elapsed time is Δt=tf−t0Δt=tf−t0, taking t0=0t0=0 means that Δt=tfΔt=tf, the final time on the stopwatch. When initial time is taken to be zero, we use the subscript 0 to denote initial values of position and velocity. That is, x0x0 is the initial position  and v0v0 is the initial velocity. We put no subscripts on the final values. That is, tt  is the final time, xx  is the final position, and vv is the final velocity. This gives a simpler expression for elapsed time—now, Δt=tΔt=t. It also simplifies the expression for displacement, which is now Δx=x−x0Δx=x−x0. Also, it simplifies the expression for change in velocity, which is now Δv=v−v0Δv=v−v0. To summarize, using the simplified notation, with the initial time taken to be zero, Δt=tf−t0Δt=tf−t0 t0=0t0=0 Δt=tfΔt=tf x0x0 v0v0 tt xx vv Δt=tΔt=t Δx=x−x0Δx=x−x0 Δv=v−v0Δv=v−v0 2.24 where the subscript 0 denotes an initial value and the absence of a subscript denotes a final value in whatever motion is under consideration. We now make the important assumption that acceleration is constant. This assumption allows us to avoid using calculus to find instantaneous acceleration. Since acceleration is constant, the average and instantaneous accelerations are equal. That is, 2.25 so we use the symbol aa for acceleration at all times. Assuming acceleration to be constant does not seriously limit the situations we can study nor degrade the accuracy of our treatment. For one thing, acceleration is constant in a great number of situations. Furthermore, in many other situations we can accurately describe motion by assuming a constant acceleration equal to the average acceleration for that motion. Finally, in motions where acceleration changes drastically, such as a car accelerating to top speed and then braking to a stop, the motion can be considered in separate parts, each of which has its own constant acceleration. aa Solving for Displacement (

) is Constant To get our first two new equations, we start with the definition of average velocity: 2.26 Substituting the simplified notation for ΔxΔx and ΔtΔt yields ΔxΔx ΔtΔt 2.27 Solving for xx yields xx 2.28 where the average velocity is 2.29 The equation v-=v0+v2v-=v0+v2 reflects the fact that, when acceleration is constant, vv is just the simple average of the initial and final velocities. For example, if you steadily increase your velocity (that is, with constant acceleration) from 30 to 60 km/h, then your average velocity during this steady increase is 45 km/h. Using the equation v-=v0+v2v-=v0+v2 to check this, we see that v-=v0+v2v-=v0+v2 vv v-=v0+v2v-=v0+v2 2.30 which seems logical. Example 2.8 A jogger runs down a straight stretch of road with an average velocity of 4.00 m/s for 2.00 min. What is his final position, taking his initial position to be zero? Draw a sketch. Figure 2.25 The final position xx is given by the equation xx 2.31 To find xx, we identify the values of x0x0, v-v-, and tt from the statement of the problem and substitute them into the equation. xx x0x0 v-v- tt 1. Identify the knowns. v-=4.00 m/sv-=4.00 m/s, Δt=2.00minΔt=2.00min, and x0=0 mx0=0 m. v-=4.00 m/sv-=4.00 m/s Δt=2.00minΔt=2.00min x0=0 mx0=0 m 2. Enter the known values into the equation. 2.32 Velocity and final displacement are both positive, which means they are in the same direction. The equation x=x0+v-tx=x0+v-t gives insight into the relationship between displacement, average velocity, and time. It shows, for example, that displacement is a linear function of average velocity. (By linear function, we mean that displacement depends on v-v- rather than on v-v- raised to some other power, such as v-2v-2. When graphed, linear functions look like straight lines with a constant slope.) On a car trip, for example, we will get twice as far in a given time if we average 90 km/h than if we average 45 km/h. x=x0+v-tx=x0+v-t v-v- v-v- v-2v-2 Figure 2.26 There is a linear relationship between displacement and average velocity. For a given time tt, an object moving twice as fast as another object will move twice as far as the other object. Solving for Final Velocity We can derive another useful equation by manipulating the definition of acceleration. 2.33 Substituting the simplified notation for ΔvΔv and ΔtΔt gives us ΔvΔv ΔtΔt 2.34 Solving for vv yields vv 2.35 Example 2.9 An airplane lands with an initial velocity of 70.0 m/s and then decelerates at 1.50 m/s21.50 m/s2 for 40.0 s. What is its final velocity? 1.50 m/s21.50 m/s2 Draw a sketch. We draw the acceleration vector in the direction opposite the velocity vector because the plane is decelerating. Figure 2.27 1.

We can calculate the final velocity using the equation v=v0+atv=v0+at. v=v0+atv=v0+at 4. Plug in the known values and solve. 2.36 The final velocity is much less than the initial velocity, as desired when slowing down, but still positive. With jet engines, reverse thrust could be maintained long enough to stop the plane and start moving it backward. That would be indicated by a negative final velocity, which is not the case here. Figure 2.28 The airplane lands with an initial velocity of 70.0 m/s and slows to a final velocity of 10.0 m/s before heading for the terminal. Note that the acceleration is negative because its direction is opposite to its velocity, which is positive. In addition to being useful in problem solving, the equation v=v0+atv=v0+at gives us insight into the relationships among velocity, acceleration, and time. From it we can see, for example, that v=v0+atv=v0+at (All of these observations fit our intuition, and it is always useful to examine basic equations in light of our intuition and experiences to check that they do indeed describe nature accurately.) Making Connections: Real-World Connection Figure 2.29 The Space Shuttle Endeavor blasts off from the Kennedy Space Center in February 2010. (credit: Matthew Simantov, Flickr) An intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) has a larger average acceleration than the Space Shuttle and achieves a greater velocity in the first minute or two of flight (actual ICBM burn times are classified—short-burn-time missiles are more difficult for an enemy to destroy). But the Space Shuttle obtains a greater final velocity, so that it can orbit the earth rather than come directly back down as an ICBM does. The Space Shuttle does this by accelerating for a longer time. Solving for Final Position When Velocity is Not Constant (

) We can combine the equations above to find a third equation that allows us to calculate the final position of an object experiencing constant acceleration. We start with 2.37 Adding v0v0 to each side of this equation and dividing by 2 gives v0v0 2.38 Since v0+v2=v-v0+v2=v- for constant acceleration, then v0+v2=v-v0+v2=v- 2.39 Now we substitute this expression for v-v- into the equation for displacement, x=x0+v-tx=x0+v-t, yielding v-v- x=x0+v-tx=x0+v-t 2.40 Example 2.10 Dragsters can achieve average accelerations of  26.0 m/s226.0 m/s2. Suppose such a dragster accelerates from rest at this rate for 5.56 s. How far does it travel in this time? 26.0 m/s226.0 m/s2 Figure 2.30 U.S. Army Top Fuel pilot Tony “The Sarge” Schumacher begins a race with a controlled burnout. (credit: Lt. Col. William Thurmond. Photo Courtesy of U.S. Army.) Draw a sketch. Figure 2.31 We are asked to find displacement, which is xx if we take x0x0 to be zero. (Think about it like the starting line of a race. It can be anywhere, but we call it 0 and measure all other positions relative to it.) We can use the equation x=x0+v0t+12at2x=x0+v0t+12at2once we identify v0v0, aa, and tt from the statement of the problem. xx x0x0 x=x0+v0t+12at2x=x0+v0t+12at2 v0v0 aa tt 1. Identify the knowns. Starting from rest means that v0=0v0=0, aa is given as 26.0m/s226.0m/s2 and tt is given as 5.56 s. v0=0v0=0 aa 26.0m/s226.0m/s2 tt 2. Plug the known values into the equation to solve for the unknown xx: xx 2.41 Since the initial position and velocity are both zero, this simplifies to 2.42 Substituting the identified values of aa and tt gives aa tt 2.43 yielding 2.44 If we convert 402 m to miles, we find that the distance covered is very close to one quarter of a mile, the standard distance for drag racing. So the answer is reasonable. This is an impressive displacement in only 5.56 s, but top-notch dragsters can do a quarter mile in even less time than this. What else can we learn by examining the equation x=x0+v0t+12at2?x=x0+v0t+12at2? We see that: x=x0+v0t+12at2?x=x0+v0t+12at2? Solving for Final Velocity when Velocity Is Not Constant  (

If we solve v=v0+atv=v0+at for tt, we get v=v0+atv=v0+at tt 2.45 Substituting this and v-=v0+v2v-=v0+v2 into x=x0+v-tx=x0+v-t, we get v-=v0+v2v-=v0+v2 x=x0+v-tx=x0+v-t 2.46 Example 2.11 Calculate the final velocity of the dragster in Example 2.10 without using information about time. Draw a sketch. Figure 2.32 The equation v2=v02+2a(x−x0)v2=v02+2a(x−x0) is ideally suited to this task because it relates velocities, acceleration, and displacement, and no time information is required. v2=v02+2a(x−x0)v2=v02+2a(x−x0) 1. Identify the known values. We know that v0=0v0=0, since the dragster starts from rest. Then we note that x−x0=402 mx−x0=402 m (this was the answer in Example 2.10). Finally, the average acceleration was given to be a=26.0 m/s2a=26.0 m/s2. v0=0v0=0 x−x0=402 mx−x0=402 m a=26.0 m/s2a=26.0 m/s2 2. Plug the knowns into the equation v2=v02+2a(x−x0)v2=v02+2a(x−x0) and solve for v.v. v2=v02+2a(x−x0)v2=v02+2a(x−x0) v.v. 2.47 Thus 2.48 To get vv, we take the square root: vv 2.49 145 m/s is about 522 km/h or about 324 mi/h, but even this breakneck speed is short of the record for the quarter mile. Also, note that a square root has two values; we took the positive value to indicate a velocity in the same direction as the acceleration. An examination of the equation v2=v02+2a(x−x0)v2=v02+2a(x−x0) can produce further insights into the general relationships among physical quantities: v2=v02+2a(x−x0)v2=v02+2a(x−x0)"

Figure 2.33 In order to determine which equations are best to use, we need to list all of the known values and identify exactly what we need to solve for. We shall do this explicitly in the next several examples, using tables to set them off. 1. Identify the knowns and what we want to solve for. We know that v0=30.0 m/sv0=30.0 m/s; v=0 v=0 ; a=−7.00m/s2a=−7.00m/s2 (aa is negative because it is in a direction opposite to velocity). We take x0x0 to be 0. We are looking for displacement ΔxΔx, or x−x0x−x0. v0=30.0 m/sv0=30.0 m/s v=0 v=0 a=−7.00m/s2a=−7.00m/s2 aa x0x0 ΔxΔx x−x0x−x0 2. Identify the equation that will help up solve the problem. The best equation to use is 2.55 This equation is best because it includes only one unknown, xx. We know the values of all the other variables in this equation. (There are other equations that would allow us to solve for xx, but they require us to know the stopping time, tt, which we do not know. We could use them but it would entail additional calculations.) xx xx tt 3. Rearrange the equation to solve for xx. xx 2.56 4. Enter known values. 2.57 Thus, 2.58 This part can be solved in exactly the same manner as Part A. The only difference is that the deceleration is –5.00 m/s2–5.00 m/s2. The result is –5.00 m/s2–5.00 m/s2 2.59 Once the driver reacts, the stopping distance is the same as it is in Parts A and B for dry and wet concrete. So to answer this question, we need to calculate how far the car travels during the reaction time, and then add that to the stopping time. It is reasonable to assume that the velocity remains constant during the driver’s reaction time. 1. Identify the knowns and what we want to solve for. We know that v-=30.0 m/sv-=30.0 m/s;
treaction=0.500streaction=0.500s;
areaction=0areaction=0. We take

Identify the best equation to use. x=x0+v-tx=x0+v-t works well because the only unknown value is xx, which is what we want to solve for. x=x0+v-tx=x0+v-t xx 3. Plug in the knowns to solve the equation. 2.60 This means the car travels 15.0 m while the driver reacts, making the total displacements in the two cases of dry and wet concrete 15.0 m greater than if he reacted instantly. 4. Add the displacement during the reaction time to the displacement when braking. 2.61 Figure 2.34 The distance necessary to stop a car varies greatly, depending on road conditions and driver reaction time. Shown here are the braking distances for dry and wet pavement, as calculated in this example,  for a car initially traveling at 30.0 m/s. Also shown are the total distances traveled from the point where the driver first sees a light turn red, assuming a 0.500 s reaction time. The displacements found in this example seem reasonable for stopping a fast-moving car. It should take longer to stop a car on wet rather than dry pavement. It is interesting that reaction time adds significantly to the displacements. But more important is the general approach to solving problems. We identify the knowns and the quantities to be determined and then find an appropriate equation. There is often more than one way to solve a problem. The various parts of this example can in fact be solved by other methods, but the solutions presented above are the shortest. Example 2.13 Suppose a car merges into freeway traffic on a 200-m-long ramp. If its initial velocity is 10.0 m/s and it accelerates at 2.00 m/s22.00 m/s2, how long does it take to travel the 200 m up the ramp? (Such information might be useful to a traffic engineer.) 2.00 m/s22.00 m/s2 Draw a sketch. Figure 2.35 We are asked to solve for the time tt. As before, we identify the known quantities in order to choose a convenient physical relationship (that is, an equation with one unknown, tt). tt tt 1. Identify the knowns and what we want to solve for. We know that v0=10 m/sv0=10 m/s; a=2.00 m/s2a=2.00 m/s2; and x=200 mx=200 m. v0=10 m/sv0=10 m/s a=2.00 m/s2a=2.00 m/s2 x=200 mx=200 m 2. We need to solve for tt. Choose the best equation. x=x0+v0t+12at2x=x0+v0t+12at2 works best because the only unknown in the equation is the variable tt for which we need to solve. tt x=x0+v0t+12at2x=x0+v0t+12at2 tt 3. We will need to rearrange the equation to solve for tt. In this case, it will be easier to plug in the knowns first. tt 2.62 4. Simplify the equation. The units of meters (m) cancel because they are in each term. We can get the units of seconds (s) to cancel by taking t=tst=ts, where tt is the magnitude of time and s is the unit. Doing so leaves t=tst=ts tt 2.63 5. Use the quadratic formula to solve for tt. tt (a) Rearrange the equation to get 0 on one side of the equation. 2.64 This is a quadratic equation of the form 2.65 where the constants are a=1.00,b=10.0,andc=−200a=1.00,b=10.0,andc=−200. a=1.00,b=10.0,andc=−200a=1.00,b=10.0,andc=−200 (b) Its solutions are given by the quadratic formula: 2.66 This yields two solutions for tt, which are tt 2.67 In this case, then, the time is t=tt=t in seconds, or t=tt=t 2.68 A negative value for time is unreasonable, since it would mean that the event happened 20 s before the motion began. We can discard that solution. Thus, 2.69 Whenever an equation contains an unknown squared, there will be two solutions. In some problems both solutions are meaningful, but in others, such as the above, only one solution is reasonable. The 10.0 s answer seems reasonable for a typical freeway on-ramp. With the basics of kinematics established, we can go on to many other interesting examples and applications. In the process of developing kinematics, we have also glimpsed a general approach to problem solving that produces both correct answers and insights into physical relationships. Problem-Solving Basics discusses problem-solving basics and outlines an approach that will help you succeed in this invaluable task. Making Connections: Take-Home Experiment—Breaking News We have been using SI units of meters per second squared to describe some examples of acceleration or deceleration of cars, runners, and trains. To achieve a better feel for these numbers, one can measure the braking deceleration of a car doing a slow (and safe) stop. Recall that, for average acceleration, a-=Δv/Δta-=Δv/Δt. While traveling in a car, slowly apply the brakes as you come up to a stop sign. Have a passenger note the initial speed in miles per hour and the time taken (in seconds) to stop. From this, calculate the deceleration in miles per hour per second. Convert this to meters per second squared and compare with other decelerations mentioned in this chapter. Calculate the distance traveled in braking. a-=Δv/Δta-=Δv/Δt Check Your Understanding A rocket accelerates at a rate of 20 m/s220 m/s2 during launch.

A certain amount of creativity and insight is required as well. Examine the situation to determine which physical principles are involved. It often helps to draw a simple sketch at the outset. You will also need to decide which direction is positive and note that on your sketch. Once you have identified the physical principles, it is much easier to find and apply the equations representing those principles. Although finding the correct equation is essential, keep in mind that equations represent physical principles, laws of nature, and relationships among physical quantities. Without a conceptual understanding of a problem, a numerical solution is meaningless. Make a list of what is given or can be inferred from the problem as stated (identify the knowns). Many problems are stated very succinctly and require some inspection to determine what is known. A sketch can also be very useful at this point. Formally identifying the knowns is of particular importance in applying physics to real-world situations. Remember, “stopped” means velocity is zero, and we often can take initial time and position as zero. Identify exactly what needs to be determined in the problem (identify the unknowns). In complex problems, especially, it is not always obvious what needs to be found or in what sequence. Making a list can help. Find an equation or set of equations that can help you solve the problem. Your list of knowns and unknowns can help here. It is easiest if you can find equations that contain only one unknown—that is, all of the other variables are known, so you can easily solve for the unknown. If the equation contains more than one unknown, then an additional equation is needed to solve the problem. In some problems, several unknowns must be determined to get at the one needed most. In such problems it is especially important to keep physical principles in mind to avoid going astray in a sea of equations. You may have to use two (or more) different equations to get the final answer. Substitute the knowns along with their units into the appropriate equation, and obtain numerical solutions complete with units. This step produces the numerical answer; it also provides a check on units that can help you find errors. If the units of the answer are incorrect, then an error has been made. However, be warned that correct units do not guarantee that the numerical part of the answer is also correct. Check the answer to see if it is reasonable: Does it make sense? This final step is extremely important—the goal of physics is to accurately describe nature. To see if the answer is reasonable, check both its magnitude and its sign, in addition to its units. Your judgment will improve as you solve more and more physics problems, and it will become possible for you to make finer and finer judgments regarding whether nature is adequately described by the answer to a problem.

Page 15,"Physics must describe nature accurately. Some problems have results that are unreasonable because one premise is unreasonable or because certain premises are inconsistent with one another. The physical principle applied correctly then produces an unreasonable result. For example, if a person starting a foot race accelerates at 0.40 m/s20.40 m/s2 for 100 s, his final speed will be 40 m/s (about 150 km/h)—clearly unreasonable because the time of 100 s is an unreasonable premise. The physics is correct in a sense, but there is more to describing nature than just manipulating equations correctly. Checking the result of a problem to see if it is reasonable does more than help uncover errors in problem solving—it also builds intuition in judging whether nature is being accurately described. 0.40 m/s20.40 m/s2 Use the following strategies to determine whether an answer is reasonable and, if it is not, to determine what is the cause. Solve the problem using strategies as outlined and in the format followed in the worked examples in the text. In the example given in the preceding paragraph, you would identify the givens as the acceleration and time and use the equation below to find the unknown final velocity. That is, 2.72 Check to see if the answer is reasonable. Is it too large or too small, or does it have the wrong sign, improper units, …? In this case, you may need to convert meters per second into a more familiar unit, such as miles per hour. 2.73 This velocity is about four times greater than a person can run—so it is too large. If the answer is unreasonable, look for what specifically could cause the identified difficulty. In the example of the runner, there are only two assumptions that are suspect.

Page 16,"The most remarkable and unexpected fact about falling objects is that, if air resistance and friction are negligible, then in a given location all objects fall toward the center of Earth with the same constant acceleration, independent of their mass. This experimentally determined fact is unexpected, because we are so accustomed to the effects of air resistance and friction that we expect light objects to fall slower than heavy ones. Figure 2.37 A hammer and a feather will fall with the same constant acceleration if air resistance is considered negligible. This is a general characteristic of gravity not unique to Earth, as astronaut David R. Scott demonstrated on the Moon in 1971, where the acceleration due to gravity is only 1.67 m/s21.67 m/s2. In the real world, air resistance can cause a lighter object to fall slower than a heavier object of the same size. A tennis ball will reach the ground after a hard baseball dropped at the same time. (It might be difficult to observe the difference if the height is not large.) Air resistance opposes the motion of an object through the air, while friction between objects—such as between clothes and a laundry chute or between a stone and a pool into which it is dropped—also opposes motion between them. For the ideal situations of these first few chapters, an object falling without air resistance or friction is defined to be in free-fall. free-fall The force of gravity causes objects to fall toward the center of Earth. The acceleration of free-falling objects is therefore called the acceleration due to gravity. The acceleration due to gravity is constant, which means we can apply the kinematics equations to any falling object where air resistance and friction are negligible. This opens a broad class of interesting situations to us. The acceleration due to gravity is so important that its magnitude is given its own symbol, gg. It is constant at any given location on Earth and has the average value acceleration due to gravity gg 2.74 Although gg varies from 9.78 m/s29.78 m/s2 to 9.83 m/s29.83 m/s2, depending on latitude, altitude, underlying geological formations, and local topography, the average value of 9.80 m/s29.80 m/s2 will be used in this text unless otherwise specified. The direction of the acceleration due to gravity is downward (towards the center of Earth). In fact, its direction defines what we call vertical. Note that whether the acceleration aa in the kinematic equations has the value +g+g or −g−g depends on how we define our coordinate system. If we define the upward direction as positive, then a=−g=−9.80 m/s2a=−g=−9.80 m/s2, and if we define the downward direction as positive, then a=g=9.80 m/s2a=g=9.80 m/s2. gg 9.78 m/s29.78 m/s2 9.83 m/s29.83 m/s2 9.80 m/s29.80 m/s2 aa +g+g −g−g a=−g=−9.80 m/s2a=−g=−9.80 m/s2 a=g=9.80 m/s2a=g=9.80 m/s2"
Page 16,"The best way to see the basic features of motion involving gravity is to start with the simplest situations and then progress toward more complex ones. So we start by considering straight up and down motion with no air resistance or friction. These assumptions mean that the velocity (if there is any) is vertical. If the object is dropped, we know the initial velocity is zero. Once the object has left contact with whatever held or threw it, the object is in free-fall. Under these circumstances, the motion is one-dimensional and has constant acceleration of magnitude gg. We will also represent vertical displacement with the symbol yy and use xx for horizontal displacement. gg yy xx Kinematic Equations for Objects in Free-Fall where Acceleration = -g 2.75 2.76 2.77 Example 2.14 A person standing on the edge of a high cliff throws a rock straight up with an initial velocity of 13.0 m/s. The rock misses the edge of the cliff as it falls back to earth. Calculate the position and velocity of the rock 1.00 s, 2.00 s, and 3.00 s after it is thrown, neglecting the effects of air resistance. Draw a sketch. Figure 2.38 We are asked to determine the position yy at various times. It is reasonable to take the initial position y0y0 to be zero. This problem involves one-dimensional motion in the vertical direction. We use plus and minus signs to indicate direction, with up being positive and down negative. Since up is positive, and the rock is thrown upward, the initial velocity must be positive too. The acceleration due to gravity is downward, so aa is negative. It is crucial that the initial velocity and the acceleration due to gravity have opposite signs. Opposite signs indicate that the acceleration due to gravity opposes the initial motion and will slow and eventually reverse it. yy y0y0 aa Since we are asked for values of position and velocity at three times, we will refer to these as y1y1 and v1v1; y2y2 and v2v2; and y3y3 and v3v3. y1y1 v1v1 y2y2 v2v2 y3y3 v3v3 y

Identify the best equation to use. We will use y=y0+v0t+12at2y=y0+v0t+12at2 because it includes only one unknown, yy (or y1y1, here), which is the value we want to find. y=y0+v0t+12at2y=y0+v0t+12at2 yy y1y1 3.

We also know from the solution above that y1=8.10 my1=8.10 m. y0=0y0=0 v0=13.0 m/sv0=13.0 m/s a=−g=−9.80 m/s2a=−g=−9.80 m/s2 t=1.00 st=1.00 s y1=8.10 my1=8.10 m 2. Identify the best equation to use. The most straightforward is v=v0−gtv=v0−gt (from v=v0+atv=v0+at, where a=gravitational acceleration=−ga=gravitational acceleration=−g). v=v0−gtv=v0−gt v=v0+atv=v0+at a=gravitational acceleration=−ga=gravitational acceleration=−g 3. Plug in the knowns and solve. 2.79 The positive value for v1v1 means that the rock is still heading upward at t=1.00st=1.00s. However, it has slowed from its original 13.0 m/s, as expected. v1v1 t=1.00st=1.00s The procedures for calculating the position and velocity at t=2.00st=2.00s and 3.00 s3.00 s are the same as those above. The results are summarized in Table 2.1 and illustrated in Figure 2.39. t=2.00st=2.00s 3.00 s3.00 s Table 2.1 Results Graphing the data helps us understand it more clearly. Figure 2.39 Vertical position, vertical velocity, and vertical acceleration vs. time for a rock thrown vertically up at the edge of a cliff. Notice that velocity changes linearly with time and that acceleration is constant. Misconception Alert! Notice that the position vs. time graph shows vertical position only. It is easy to get the impression that the graph shows some horizontal motion—the shape of the graph looks like the path of a projectile. But this is not the case; the horizontal axis is time, not space. The actual path of the rock in space is straight up, and straight down. The interpretation of these results is important. At 1.00 s the rock is above its starting point and heading upward, since y1y1 and v1v1 are both positive. At 2.00 s, the rock is still above its starting point, but the negative velocity means it is moving downward. At 3.00 s, both y3y3 and v3v3 are negative, meaning the rock is below its starting point and continuing to move downward. Notice that when the rock is at its highest point (at 1.33 s), its velocity is zero, but its acceleration is still −9.80 m/s2−9.80 m/s2. Its acceleration is −9.80 m/s2−9.80 m/s2 for the whole trip—while it is moving up and while it is moving down. Note that the values for yy are the positions (or displacements) of the rock, not the total distances traveled. Finally, note that free-fall applies to upward motion as well as downward. Both have the same acceleration—the acceleration due to gravity, which remains constant the entire time. Astronauts training in the famous Vomit Comet, for example, experience free-fall while arcing up as well as down, as we will discuss in more detail later. y1y1 v1v1 y3y3 v3v3 −9.80 m/s2−9.80 m/s2 −9.80 m/s2−9.80 m/s2 yy Making Connections: Take-Home Experiment—Reaction Time A simple experiment can be done to determine your reaction time. Have a friend hold a ruler between your thumb and index finger, separated by about 1 cm. Note the mark on the ruler that is right between your fingers. Have your friend drop the ruler unexpectedly, and try to catch it between your two fingers. Note the new reading on the ruler. Assuming acceleration is that due to gravity, calculate your reaction time. How far would you travel in a car (moving at 30 m/s) if the time it took your foot to go from the gas pedal to the brake was twice this reaction time? Example 2.15 What happens if the person on the cliff throws the rock straight down, instead of straight up? To explore this question, calculate the velocity of the rock when it is 5.10 m below the starting point, and has been thrown downward with an initial speed of 13.0 m/s. Draw a sketch. Figure 2.40 Since up is positive, the final position of the rock will be negative because it finishes below the starting point at y0=0y0=0. Similarly, the initial velocity is downward and therefore negative, as is the acceleration due to gravity. We expect the final velocity to be negative since the rock will continue to move downward. y0=0y0=0 1. Identify the knowns. y0=0y0=0;
y1=−5.10 my1=−5.10 m;

The equation v2=v02+2a(y−y0)v2=v02+2a(y−y0) works well because the only unknown in it is vv. (We will plug y1y1 in for yy.) v2=v02+2a(y−y0)v2=v02+2a(y−y0) vv y1y1 yy 3. Enter the known values 2.80 where we have retained extra significant figures because this is an intermediate result. Taking the square root, and noting that a square root can be positive or negative, gives 2.81 The negative root is chosen to indicate that the rock is still heading down. Thus, 2.82 Note that this is exactly the same velocity the rock had at this position when it was thrown straight upward with the same initial speed. (See Example 2.14 and Figure 2.41(a).) This is not a coincidental result. Because we only consider the acceleration due to gravity in this problem, the speed of a falling object depends only on its initial speed and its vertical position relative to the starting point. For example, if the velocity of the rock is calculated at a height of 8.10 m above the starting point (using the method from Example 2.14) when the initial velocity is 13.0 m/s straight up, a result of ±3.20 m/s±3.20 m/s is obtained. Here both signs are meaningful; the positive value occurs when the rock is at 8.10 m and heading up, and the negative value occurs when the rock is at 8.10 m and heading back down. It has the same speed but the opposite direction. ±3.20 m/s±3.20 m/s Figure 2.41 (a) A person throws a rock straight up, as explored in Example 2.14. The arrows are velocity vectors at 0, 1.00, 2.00, and 3.00 s. (b) A person throws a rock straight down from a cliff with the same initial speed as before, as in Example 2.15. Note that at the same distance below the point of release, the rock has the same velocity in both cases. Another way to look at it is this: In Example 2.14, the rock is thrown up with an initial velocity of 13.0 m/s13.0 m/s. It rises and then falls back down. When its position is y=0y=0 on its way back down, its velocity is −13.0 m/s−13.0 m/s. That is, it has the same speed on its way down as on its way up. We would then expect its velocity at a position of y=−5.10 my=−5.10 m to be the same whether we have thrown it upwards at +13.0 m/s+13.0 m/s or thrown it downwards at −13.0 m/s−13.0 m/s. The velocity of the rock on its way down from y=0y=0 is the same whether we have thrown it up or down to start with, as long as the speed with which it was initially thrown is the same. 13.0 m/s13.0 m/s y=0y=0 −13.0 m/s−13.0 m/s y=−5.10 my=−5.10 m +13.0 m/s+13.0 m/s −13.0 m/s−13.0 m/s y=0y=0 Example 2.16 The acceleration due to gravity on Earth differs slightly from place to place, depending on topography (e.g., whether you are on a hill or in a valley) and subsurface geology (whether there is dense rock like iron ore as opposed to light rock like salt beneath you.) The precise acceleration due to gravity can be calculated from data taken in an introductory physics laboratory course. An object, usually a metal ball for which air resistance is negligible, is dropped and the time it takes to fall a known distance is measured. See, for example, Figure 2.42. Very precise results can be produced with this method if sufficient care is taken in measuring the distance fallen and the elapsed time. Figure 2.42 Positions and velocities of a metal ball released from rest when air resistance is negligible. Velocity is seen to increase linearly with time while displacement increases with time squared. Acceleration is a constant and is equal to gravitational acceleration. Suppose the ball falls 1.0000 m in 0.45173 s. Assuming the ball is not affected by air resistance, what is the precise acceleration due to gravity at this location? Draw a sketch. Figure 2.43 We need to solve for acceleration aa. Note that in this case, displacement is downward and therefore negative, as is acceleration. aa 1. Identify the knowns. y0=0y0=0;

Substitute known values yields 2.86 so, because a=−ga=−g with the directions we have chosen, a=−ga=−g 2.87 The negative value for aa indicates that the gravitational acceleration is downward, as expected. We expect the value to be somewhere around the average value of 9.80 m/s29.80 m/s2, so 9.8010 m/s29.8010 m/s2 makes sense. Since the data going into the calculation are relatively precise, this value for gg is more precise than the average value of 9.80 m/s29.80 m/s2; it represents the local value for the acceleration due to gravity. aa 9.80 m/s29.80 m/s2 9.8010 m/s29.8010 m/s2 gg 9.80 m/s29.80 m/s2 Check Your Understanding A chunk of ice breaks off a glacier and falls 30.0 meters before it hits the water.

Page 17,"First note that graphs in this text have perpendicular axes, one horizontal and the other vertical. When two physical quantities are plotted against one another in such a graph, the horizontal axis is usually considered to be an independent variable and the vertical axis a dependent variable. If we call the horizontal axis the xx-axis and the vertical axis the yy-axis, as in Figure 2.44, a straight-line graph has the general form independent variable dependent variable xx yy 2.89 Here mm is the slope, defined to be the rise divided by the run (as seen in the figure) of the straight line.

Page 17,"Time is usually an independent variable that other quantities, such as position, depend upon. A graph of position versus time would, thus, have xx on the vertical axis and tt on the horizontal axis.   Figure 2.45 is just such a straight-line graph. It shows a graph of position versus time for a jet-powered car on a very flat dry lake bed in Nevada. xx tt Figure 2.45 Graph of position versus time for a jet-powered car on the Bonneville Salt Flats. Using the relationship between dependent and independent variables, we see that the slope in the graph above is average velocity v-v- and the intercept is position at time zero—that is, x0x0. Substituting these symbols into y=mx+by=mx+b gives v-v- x0x0 y=mx+by=mx+b 2.90 or 2.91 Thus a graph of position versus time gives a general relationship among displacement(change in position), velocity, and time, as well as giving detailed numerical information about a specific situation. The Slope of x  vs. t The slope of the graph of position xx vs. time tt is velocity vv. xx tt vv 2.92 Notice that this equation is the same as that derived algebraically from other motion equations in Motion Equations for Constant Acceleration in One Dimension. From the figure we can see that the car has a position of 525 m at 0.50 s and 2000 m at 6.40 s. Its position at other times can be read from the graph; furthermore, information about its velocity and acceleration can also be obtained from the graph. Example 2.17 Find the average velocity of the car whose position is graphed in   Figure 2.45. The slope of a graph of xx vs. tt is average velocity, since slope equals rise over run. In this case, rise = change in position and run = change in time, so that xx tt 2.93 Since the slope is constant here, any two points on the graph can be used to find the slope. (Generally speaking, it is most accurate to use two widely separated points on the straight line. This is because any error in reading data from the graph is proportionally smaller if the interval is larger.) 1. Choose two points on the line. In this case, we choose the points labeled on the graph: (6.4 s, 2000 m) and (0.50 s, 525 m). (Note, however, that you could choose any two points.) 2. Substitute the xx and tt values of the chosen points into the equation. Remember in calculating change (Δ)(Δ) we always use final value minus initial value. xx tt (Δ)(Δ) 2.94 yielding 2.95 This is an impressively large land speed (900 km/h, or about 560 mi/h): much greater than the typical highway speed limit of 60 mi/h (27 m/s or 96 km/h), but considerably shy of the record of 343 m/s (1234 km/h or 766 mi/h) set in 1997."

Page 17,"The graphs in Figure 2.46 below represent the motion of the jet-powered car as it accelerates toward its top speed, but only during the time when its acceleration is constant. Time starts at zero for this motion (as if measured with a stopwatch), and the position and velocity are initially 200 m and 15 m/s, respectively. Figure 2.46 Graphs of motion of a jet-powered car during the time span when its acceleration is constant. (a) The slope of an xx vs. tt graph is velocity. This is shown at two points, and the instantaneous velocities obtained are plotted in the next graph. Instantaneous velocity at any point is the slope of the tangent at that point. (b) The slope of the vv vs. tt graph is constant for this part of the motion, indicating constant acceleration. (c) Acceleration has the constant value of 5.0 m/s25.0 m/s2 over the time interval plotted. Figure 2.47 A U.S. Air Force jet car speeds down a track. (credit: Matt Trostle, Flickr) The graph of position versus time in Figure 2.46(a) is a curve rather than a straight line. The slope of the curve becomes steeper as time progresses, showing that the velocity is increasing over time. The slope at any point on a position-versus-time graph is the instantaneous velocity at that point. It is found by drawing a straight line tangent to the curve at the point of interest and taking the slope of this straight line. Tangent lines are shown for two points in Figure 2.46(a). If this is done at every point on the curve and the values are plotted against time, then the graph of velocity versus time shown in Figure 2.46(b) is obtained. Furthermore, the slope of the graph of velocity versus time is acceleration, which is shown in Figure 2.46(c). Example 2.18 Calculate the velocity of the jet car at a time of 25 s by finding the slope of the xx vs. tt graph in the graph below. xx tt Figure 2.48 The slope of an xx vs. tt graph is velocity. This is shown at two points. Instantaneous velocity at any point is the slope of the tangent at that point. The slope of a curve at a point is equal to the slope of a straight line tangent to the curve at that point. This principle is illustrated in Figure 2.48, where Q is the point at t=25 st=25 s. t=25 st=25 s 1. Find the tangent line to the curve at t=25 st=25 s. t=25 st=25 s 2. Determine the endpoints of the tangent. These correspond to a position of 1300 m at time 19 s and a position of 3120 m at time 32 s. 3. Plug these endpoints into the equation to solve for the slope, vv. vv 2.96 Thus, 2.97 This is the value given in this figure’s table for vv at t=25 st=25 s. The value of 140 m/s for vQvQ is plotted in Figure 2.48. The entire graph of vv vs. tt can be obtained in this fashion. vv t=25 st=25 s vQvQ vv tt Carrying this one step further, we note that the slope of a velocity versus time graph is acceleration. Slope is rise divided by run; on a vv vs. tt graph, rise = change in velocity ΔvΔv and run = change in time ΔtΔt. vv tt ΔvΔv ΔtΔt The Slope of v vs. t The slope of a graph of velocity vv vs. time tt is acceleration aa. vv tt aa 2.98 Since the velocity versus time graph in Figure 2.46(b) is a straight line, its slope is the same everywhere, implying that acceleration is constant. Acceleration versus time is graphed in Figure 2.46(c). Additional general information can be obtained from Figure 2.48 and the expression for a straight line, y=mx+by=mx+b. y=mx+by=mx+b In this case, the vertical axis yy is VV, the intercept bb is v0v0, the slope mm is aa, and the horizontal axis xx is tt. Substituting these symbols yields yy VV bb v0v0 mm aa xx tt 2.99 A general relationship for velocity, acceleration, and time has again been obtained from a graph. Notice that this equation was also derived algebraically from other motion equations in Motion Equations for Constant Acceleration in One Dimension. It is not accidental that the same equations are obtained by graphical analysis as by algebraic techniques. In fact, an important way to discover physical relationships is to measure various physical quantities and then make graphs of one quantity against another to see if they are correlated in any way. Correlations imply physical relationships and might be shown by smooth graphs such as those above. From such graphs, mathematical relationships can sometimes be postulated. Further experiments are then performed to determine the validity of the hypothesized relationships."
Page 17,"Now consider the motion of the jet car as it goes from 165 m/s to its top velocity of 250 m/s, graphed in Figure 2.49. Time again starts at zero, and the initial velocity is 165 m/s. (This was the final velocity of the car in the motion graphed in Figure 2.46.) Acceleration gradually decreases from 5.0 m/s25.0 m/s2 to zero when the car hits 250 m/s. The velocity increases until 55 s and then becomes constant, since acceleration decreases to zero at 55 s and remains zero afterward. 5.0 m/s25.0 m/s2 Figure 2.49 Graphs of motion of a jet-powered car as it reaches its top velocity. This motion begins where the motion in Figure 2.46 ends. (a) The velocity gradually approaches its top value. The slope of this graph is  acceleration. It is plotted in the final graph. (b) Acceleration gradually declines to zero when velocity becomes constant. Notice in each of the three graphs that the acceleration drops down to zero and the velocity levels out. This results in a position-time graph that is almost linear. A close-up of the position time graph would show a slight curvature, as indicated in the velocity graph. Example 2.19 Calculate the acceleration of the jet car at a time of 25 s by finding the slope of the vv vs. tt graph in Figure 2.49(a). vv tt The slope of the curve at t=25 st=25 s is equal to the slope of the line tangent at that point, as illustrated in Figure 2.49(a). t=25 st=25 s Determine endpoints of the tangent line from the figure, and then plug them into the equation to solve for slope, aa. aa 2.100 2.101 Note that this value for aa is consistent with the value plotted in Figure 2.49(b) at t=25 st=25 s. aa t=25 st=25 s A graph of position versus time can be used to generate a graph of velocity versus time, and a graph of velocity versus time can be used to generate a graph of acceleration versus time. We do this by finding the slope of the graphs at every point. If the graph is linear (i.e., a line with a constant slope), it is easy to find the slope at any point and you have the slope for every point. Graphical analysis of motion can be used to describe both specific and general characteristics of kinematics. Graphs can also be used for other topics in physics. An important aspect of exploring physical relationships is to graph them and look for underlying relationships.

Page 23,"Suppose you want to walk from one point to another in a city with uniform square blocks, as pictured in Figure 3.3. Figure 3.3 A pedestrian walks a two-dimensional path between two points in a city. In this scene, all blocks are square and are the same size. The straight-line path that a helicopter might fly is blocked to you as a pedestrian, and so you are forced to take a two-dimensional path, such as the one shown. You walk 14 blocks in all, 9 east followed by 5 north. What is the straight-line distance? An old adage states that the shortest distance between two points is a straight line. The two legs of the trip and the straight-line path form a right triangle, and so the Pythagorean theorem, a2 + b2 = c2a2 + b2 = c2, can be used to find the straight-line distance. a2 + b2 = c2a2 + b2 = c2 Figure 3.4 The Pythagorean theorem relates the length of the legs of a right triangle, labeled aa and bb, with the hypotenuse, labeled cc. The relationship is given by: a2+ b2= c2a2+ b2= c2. This can be rewritten, solving for cc : c = a2+ b2c = a2+ b2. The hypotenuse of the triangle is the straight-line path, and so in this case its length in units of city blocks is (9 blocks)2+ (5 blocks)2= 10.3 blocks(9 blocks)2+ (5 blocks)2= 10.3 blocks, considerably shorter than the 14 blocks you walked. (Note that we are using three significant figures in the answer. Although it appears that “9” and “5” have only one significant digit, they are discrete numbers. In this case “9 blocks” is the same as “9.0 or 9.00 blocks.” We have decided to use three significant figures in the answer in order to show the result more precisely.) (9 blocks)2+ (5 blocks)2= 10.3 blocks(9 blocks)2+ (5 blocks)2= 10.3 blocks Figure 3.5 The straight-line path followed by a helicopter between the two points is shorter than the 14 blocks walked by the pedestrian. All blocks are square and the same size. The fact that the straight-line distance (10.3 blocks) in Figure 3.5 is less than the total distance walked (14 blocks) is one example of a general characteristic of vectors. (Recall that vectors are quantities that have both magnitude and direction.) vectors As for one-dimensional kinematics, we use arrows to represent vectors. The length of the arrow is proportional to the vector’s magnitude. The arrow’s length is indicated by hash marks in Figure 3.3 and Figure 3.5. The arrow points in the same direction as the vector. For two-dimensional motion, the path of an object can be represented with three vectors: one vector shows the straight-line path between the initial and final points of the motion, one vector shows the horizontal component of the motion, and one vector shows the vertical component of the motion. The horizontal and vertical components of the motion add together to give the straight-line path. For example, observe the three vectors in Figure 3.5. The first represents a 9-block displacement east. The second represents a 5-block displacement north. These vectors are added to give the third vector, with a 10.3-block total displacement. The third vector is the straight-line path between the two points. Note that in this example, the vectors that we are adding are perpendicular to each other and thus form a right triangle. This means that we can use the Pythagorean theorem to calculate the magnitude of the total displacement. (Note that we cannot use the Pythagorean theorem to add vectors that are not perpendicular. We will develop techniques for adding vectors having any direction, not just those perpendicular to one another, in Vector Addition and Subtraction: Graphical Methods and Vector Addition and Subtraction: Analytical Methods.)"
Page 23,"The person taking the path shown in Figure 3.5 walks east and then north (two perpendicular directions). How far they walk east is only affected by their motion eastward. Similarly, how far they walk north is only affected by their motion northward. Independence of Motion The horizontal and vertical components of two-dimensional motion are independent of each other. Any motion in the horizontal direction does not affect motion in the vertical direction, and vice versa. This is true in a simple scenario like that of walking in one direction first, followed by another. It is also true of more complicated motion involving movement in two directions at once. For example, let’s compare the motions of two baseballs. One baseball is dropped from rest. At the same instant, another is thrown horizontally from the same height and follows a curved path. A stroboscope has captured the positions of the balls at fixed time intervals as they fall. Figure 3.6 This shows the motions of two identical balls—one falls from rest, the other has an initial horizontal velocity. Each subsequent position is an equal time interval. Arrows represent horizontal and vertical velocities at each position. The ball on the right has an initial horizontal velocity, while the ball on the left has no horizontal velocity. Despite the difference in horizontal velocities, the vertical velocities and positions are identical for both balls. This shows that the vertical and horizontal motions are independent. It is remarkable that for each flash of the strobe, the vertical positions of the two balls are the same. This similarity implies that the vertical motion is independent of whether or not the ball is moving horizontally. (Assuming no air resistance, the vertical motion of a falling object is influenced by gravity only, and not by any horizontal forces.) Careful examination of the ball thrown horizontally shows that it travels the same horizontal distance between flashes. This is due to the fact that there are no additional forces on the ball in the horizontal direction after it is thrown. This result means that the horizontal velocity is constant, and affected neither by vertical motion nor by gravity (which is vertical). Note that this case is true only for ideal conditions. In the real world, air resistance will affect the speed of the balls in both directions. The two-dimensional curved path of the horizontally thrown ball is composed of two independent one-dimensional motions (horizontal and vertical). The key to analyzing such motion, called projectile motion, is to resolve (break) it into motions along perpendicular directions. Resolving two-dimensional motion into perpendicular components is possible because the components are independent. We shall see how to resolve vectors in Vector Addition and Subtraction: Graphical Methods and Vector Addition and Subtraction: Analytical Methods. We will find such techniques to be useful in many areas of physics."

Page 24,"A vector is a quantity that has magnitude and direction. Displacement, velocity, acceleration, and force, for example, are all vectors. In one-dimensional, or straight-line, motion, the direction of a vector can be given simply by a plus or minus sign. In two dimensions (2-d), however, we specify the direction of a vector relative to some reference frame (i.e., coordinate system), using an arrow having length proportional to the vector’s magnitude and pointing in the direction of the vector. vector Figure 3.8 shows such a graphical representation of a vector, using as an example the total displacement for the person walking in a city considered in Kinematics in Two Dimensions: An Introduction.

Finally, she turns and walks 32.0 m in a direction 68.0° south of east. 49.0º49.0º 15.0º15.0º Represent each displacement vector graphically with an arrow, labeling the first AA, the second BB, and the third CC, making the lengths proportional to the distance and the directions as specified relative to an east-west line. The head-to-tail method outlined above will give a way to determine the magnitude and direction of the resultant displacement, denoted RR. AA BB CC RR (1) Draw the three displacement vectors. Figure 3.14 (2) Place the vectors head to tail retaining both their initial magnitude and direction. Figure 3.15 (3) Draw the resultant vector, RR. RR Figure 3.16 (4) Use a ruler to measure the magnitude of RR, and a protractor to measure the direction of RR. While the direction of the vector can be specified in many ways, the easiest way is to measure the angle between the vector and the nearest horizontal or vertical axis. Since the resultant vector is south of the eastward pointing axis, we flip the protractor upside down and measure the angle between the eastward axis and the vector. RR RR Figure 3.17 In this case, the total displacement RR is seen to have a magnitude of 50.8 m and to lie in a direction 5.47º5.47º south of east. By using its magnitude and direction, this vector can be expressed as

It is also important to note that the resultant is independent of the order in which the vectors are added. Therefore, we could add the vectors in any order as illustrated in Figure 3.18 and we will still get the same solution. Figure 3.18 Here, we see that when the same vectors are added in a different order, the result is the same. This characteristic is true in every case and is an important characteristic of vectors. Vector addition is commutative. Vectors can be added in any order. commutative 3.1 (This is true for the addition of ordinary numbers as well—you get the same result whether you add 2+32+3

3+23+2, for example). 2+32+3 3+23+2"

is defined to be –B–B; that is, graphically the negative of any vector has the same magnitude but the opposite direction, as shown in Figure 3.19.

So BB is the negative of –B–B; it has the same length but opposite direction. The subtraction of vector BB from vector AA is then simply defined to be the addition of –B–B to AA. Note that vector subtraction is the addition of a negative vector. The order of subtraction does not affect the results. BB AA –B–B AA 3.2 This is analogous to the subtraction of scalars (where, for example, 5 – 2 = 5 + (–2)5 – 2 = 5 + (–2)). Again, the result is independent of the order in which the subtraction is made. When vectors are subtracted graphically, the techniques outlined above are used, as the following example illustrates. 5 – 2 = 5 + (–2)5 – 2 = 5 + (–2) Example 3.2 A woman sailing a boat at night is following directions to a dock. The instructions read to first sail 27.5 m in a direction 66.0º66.0º north of east from her current location, and then travel 30.0 m in a direction 112º112º north of east (or 22.0º22.0º west of north). If the woman makes a mistake and travels in the opposite direction for the second leg of the trip, where will she end up? Compare this location with the location of the dock. 66.0º66.0º 112º112º 22.0º22.0º Figure 3.20 We can represent the first leg of the trip with a vector AA, and the second leg of the trip with a vector

BB. The dock is located at a location A + BA + B. If the woman mistakenly travels in the opposite direction for the second leg of the journey, she will travel a distance BB  (30.0 m) in the direction 180º–112º=68º180º–112º=68º  south of east. We represent this as –B–B, as shown below. The vector –B–B has the same magnitude as BB but is in the opposite direction. Thus, she will end up at a location A+(–B)A+(–B), or A–BA–B. AA BB A + BA + B BB 180º–112º=68º180º–112º=68º –B–B –B–B BB A+(–B)A+(–B) A–BA–B Figure 3.21 We will perform vector addition to compare the location of the dock, A + BA + B, with the location at which the woman mistakenly arrives, A + (–B)A + (–B).

Because subtraction of a vector is the same as addition of a vector with the opposite direction, the graphical method of subtracting vectors works the same as for addition."
Page 24,"If we decided to walk three times as far on the first leg of the trip considered in the preceding example, then we would walk 3 × 27.5 m3 × 27.5 m, or 82.5 m, in a direction 66.0º66.0º north of east. This is an example of multiplying a vector by a positive scalar. Notice that the magnitude changes, but the direction stays the same. 3 × 27.5 m3 × 27.5 m 66.0º66.0º scalar If the scalar is negative, then multiplying a vector by it changes the vector’s magnitude and gives the new vector the opposite direction. For example, if you multiply by –2, the magnitude doubles but the direction changes. We can summarize these rules in the following way: When vector AA is multiplied by a scalar cc, AA cc In our case, c=3c=3 and A=27.5 mA=27.5 m. Vectors are multiplied by scalars in many situations. Note that division is the inverse of multiplication. For example, dividing by 2 is the same as multiplying by the value (1/2). The rules for multiplication of vectors by scalars are the same for division; simply treat the divisor as a scalar between 0 and 1. c=3c=3 A=27.5 mA=27.5 m"
Page 24,"In the examples above, we have been adding vectors to determine the resultant vector. In many cases, however, we will need to do the opposite. We will need to take a single vector and find what other vectors added together produce it. In most cases, this involves determining the perpendicular components of a single vector, for example the x- and y-components, or the north-south and east-west components. components For example, we may know that the total displacement of a person walking in a city is 10.3 blocks in a direction 29.0º29.0º north of east and want to find out how many blocks east and north had to be walked. This method is called finding the components (or parts) of the displacement in the east and north directions, and it is the inverse of the process followed to find the total displacement. It is one example of finding the components of a vector. There are many applications in physics where this is a useful thing to do. We will see this soon in Projectile Motion, and much more when we cover forces  in Dynamics: Newton’s Laws of Motion. Most of these involve finding components along perpendicular axes (such as north and east), so that right triangles are involved.

Page 25,"Analytical techniques and right triangles go hand-in-hand in physics because (among other things) motions along perpendicular directions are independent. We very often need to separate a vector into perpendicular components. For example, given a vector like AA in Figure 3.24, we may wish to find which two perpendicular vectors, AxAx and AyAy, add to produce it. AA AxAx AyAy Figure 3.24 The vector AA, with its tail at the origin of an x, y-coordinate system, is shown together with its x- and y-components, AxAx and AyAy. These vectors form a right triangle. The analytical relationships among these vectors are summarized below. AxAx and AyAy  are defined to be the components of AA along the x- and y-axes. The three vectors AA, AxAx, and AyAy form a right triangle: AxAx AyAy AA AA AxAx AyAy 3.3 Note that this relationship between vector components and the resultant vector holds only for vector quantities (which include both magnitude and direction). The relationship does not apply for the magnitudes alone. For example, if Ax=3 mAx=3 m east,

Ay=4 mAy=4 m north, and

A=5 mA=5 m north-east, then it is true that the vectors Ax + Ay = AAx + Ay = A. However, it is not true that the sum of the magnitudes of the vectors is also equal.

Ay=AsinθAy=Asinθ to find the components. In Figure 3.29, these components are

AxAx,

Ax=AcosθAx=Acosθ Ay=AsinθAy=Asinθ AxAx AyAy BxBx ByBy AA BB θAθA θBθB Figure 3.29 To add vectors AA and BB, first determine the horizontal and vertical components of each vector. These are the dotted vectors AxAx, AyAy, BxBx and  ByBy shown in the image. Step 2. Find the components of the resultant along each axis by adding the components of the individual vectors along that axis. That is, as shown in Figure 3.30, 3.12 and 3.13 Figure 3.30 The magnitude of the vectors AxAx and BxBx add to give the magnitude RxRx of the resultant vector in the horizontal direction. Similarly, the magnitudes of the vectors AyAy and  ByBy add to give the magnitude RyRy of the resultant vector in the vertical direction. Components along the same axis, say the x-axis, are vectors along the same line and, thus, can be added to one another like ordinary numbers. The same is true for components along the y-axis. (For example, a 9-block eastward walk could be taken in two legs, the first 3 blocks east and the second 6 blocks east, for a total of 9, because they are along the same direction.) So resolving vectors into components along common axes makes it easier to add them. Now that the components of RR are known, its magnitude and direction can be found. RR Step 3. To get the magnitude RR of the resultant, use the Pythagorean theorem: RR 3.14 Step 4. To get the direction of the resultant relative to the x-axis: 3.15 The following example illustrates this technique for adding vectors using perpendicular components. Example 3.3 Add the vector AA to the vector BB shown in Figure 3.31, using perpendicular components along the x- and y-axes. The x- and y-axes are along the east–west and north–south directions, respectively. Vector AA represents the first leg of a walk in which a person walks 53.0 m53.0 m in a direction 20.0º20.0º north of east. Vector BB represents the second leg, a displacement of 34.0 m34.0 m in a direction 63.0º63.0º north of east. AA BB AA 53.0 m53.0 m 20.0º20.0º BB 34.0 m34.0 m 63.0º63.0º Figure 3.31 Vector AA has magnitude 53.0 m53.0 m and direction 20.0º20.0º north of the x-axis. Vector BB has magnitude 34.0 m34.0 m and direction 63.0º63.0º north of the x-axis. You can use analytical methods to determine the magnitude and direction of RR. The components of AA and BB along the x- and y-axes represent walking due east and due north to get to the same ending point. Once found, they are combined to produce the resultant. AA BB Following the method outlined above, we first find the components of

AA and

BB along the x- and y-axes. Note that

A=53.0 mA=53.0 m,

θA=20.0ºθA=20.0º,

B=34.0 mB=34.0 m, and θB=63.0ºθB=63.0º.

 We find the x-components by using Ax=AcosθAx=Acosθ, which gives AA BB A=53.0 mA=53.0 m θA=20.0ºθA=20.0º B=34.0 mB=34.0 m θB=63.0ºθB=63.0º Ax=AcosθAx=Acosθ 3.16 and 3.17 Similarly, the y-components are found using Ay=AsinθAAy=AsinθA: Ay=AsinθAAy=AsinθA 3.18 and 3.19 The x- and y-components of the resultant are thus 3.20 and 3.21 Now we can find the magnitude of the resultant by using the Pythagorean theorem: 3.22 so that 3.23 Finally, we find the direction of the resultant: 3.24 Thus, 3.25 Figure 3.32 Using analytical methods, we see that the magnitude of RR is 81.2 m81.2 m and its direction is 36.6º36.6º north of east. This example illustrates the addition of vectors using perpendicular components. Vector subtraction using perpendicular components is very similar—it is just the addition of a negative vector. Subtraction of vectors is accomplished by the addition of a negative vector. That is, A−B≡A+(–B)A−B≡A+(–B). Thus, the method for the subtraction of vectors using perpendicular components is identical to that for addition. The components of

–B–B are the negatives of the components of

BB. The x- and y-components of the resultant A−B = RA−B = R are thus A−B≡A+(–B)A−B≡A+(–B) –B–B BB A−B = RA−B = R 3.26 and 3.27 and the rest of the method outlined above is identical to that for addition. (See Figure 3.33.) Analyzing vectors using perpendicular components is very useful in many areas of physics, because perpendicular quantities are often independent of one another. The next module, Projectile Motion, is one of many in which using perpendicular components helps make the picture clear and simplifies the physics.

Page 27,"If a person rows a boat across a rapidly flowing river and tries to head directly for the other shore, the boat instead moves diagonally relative to the shore, as in Figure 3.40. The boat does not move in the direction in which it is pointed. The reason, of course, is that the river carries the boat downstream. Similarly, if a small airplane flies overhead in a strong crosswind, you can sometimes see that the plane is not moving in the direction in which it is pointed, as illustrated in Figure 3.41. The plane is moving straight ahead relative to the air, but the movement of the air mass relative to the ground carries it sideways. Figure 3.40 A boat trying to head straight across a river will actually move diagonally relative to the shore as shown. Its total velocity (solid arrow) relative to the shore is the sum of its velocity relative to the river plus the velocity of the river relative to the shore. Figure 3.41 An airplane heading straight north is instead carried to the west and slowed down by wind. The plane does not move relative to the ground in the direction it points; rather, it moves in the direction of its total velocity (solid arrow). In each of these situations, an object has a velocity relative to a medium (such as a river) and that medium has a velocity relative to an observer on solid ground. The velocity of the object relative to the observer is the sum of these velocity vectors, as indicated in Figure 3.40 and Figure 3.41. These situations are only two of many in which it is useful to add velocities. In this module, we first re-examine how to add velocities and then consider certain aspects of what relative velocity means. velocity How do we add velocities? Velocity is a vector (it has both magnitude and direction); the rules of vector addition discussed in Vector Addition and Subtraction: Graphical Methods and Vector Addition and Subtraction: Analytical Methods apply to the addition of velocities, just as they do for any other vectors. In one-dimensional motion, the addition of velocities is simple—they add like ordinary numbers. For example, if a field hockey player is moving at 5 m/s5 m/s straight toward the goal and drives the ball in the same direction with a velocity of 30 m/s30 m/s relative to her body, then the velocity of the ball is 35 m/s35 m/s relative to the stationary, profusely sweating goalkeeper standing in front of the goal. vector addition 5 m/s5 m/s 30 m/s30 m/s 35 m/s35 m/s In two-dimensional motion, either graphical or analytical techniques can be used to add velocities. We will concentrate on analytical techniques. The following equations give the relationships between the magnitude and direction of velocity (vv and θθ) and its components (vxvx and vyvy) along the x- and y-axes of an appropriately chosen coordinate system: vv θθ vxvx vyvy 3.72 3.73 3.74 3.75 Figure 3.42 The velocity,

The first two equations are used to find the components of a velocity when its magnitude and direction are known. The last two are used to find the magnitude and direction of velocity when its components are known. Take-Home Experiment: Relative Velocity of a Boat Fill a bathtub half-full of water. Take a toy boat or some other object that floats in water. Unplug the drain so water starts to drain. Try pushing the boat from one side of the tub to the other and perpendicular to the flow of water. Which way do you need to push the boat so that it ends up immediately opposite? Compare the directions of the flow of water, heading of the boat, and actual velocity of the boat. Example 3.6 Figure 3.43 A boat attempts to travel straight across a river at a speed 0.75 m/s. The current in the river, however, flows at a speed of 1.20 m/s to the right. Refer to Figure 3.43, which shows a boat trying to go straight across the river. Let us calculate the magnitude and direction of the boat’s velocity relative to an observer on the shore, vtotvtot. The velocity of the boat, vboatvboat, is 0.75 m/s in the

y vrivervriver We start by choosing a coordinate system with its xx-axis parallel to the velocity of the river, as shown in Figure 3.43. Because the boat is directed straight toward the other shore, its velocity relative to the water is parallel to the yy-axis and perpendicular to the velocity of the river. Thus, we can add the two velocities by using the equations vtot=vx2+vy2vtot=vx2+vy2 and θ=tan−1(vy/vx)θ=tan−1(vy/vx) directly. xx yy vtot=vx2+vy2vtot=vx2+vy2 θ=tan−1(vy/vx)θ=tan−1(vy/vx) The magnitude of the total velocity is 3.76 where 3.77 and 3.78 Thus, 3.79 yielding 3.80 The direction of the total velocity

What is the speed and direction of the wind? In this problem, somewhat different from the previous example, we know the total velocity
vtotvtot and that it is the sum of two other velocities,

vwvw (the wind) and

vpvp (the plane relative to the air mass). The quantity

vpvp is known, and we are asked to find

vwvw. None of the velocities are perpendicular, but it is possible to find their components along a common set of perpendicular axes. If we can find the components of

vwvw, then we can combine them to solve for its magnitude and direction. As shown in Figure 3.44, we choose a coordinate system with its x-axis due east and its y-axis due north (parallel to

vpvp). (You may wish to look back at the discussion of the addition of vectors using perpendicular components in Vector Addition and Subtraction: Analytical Methods.) vtotvtot vwvw vpvp vpvp vwvw vwvw vpvp Because

vtotvtot is the vector sum of the

vwvw and

vpvp, its x- and y-components are the sums of the x- and y-components of the wind and plane velocities. Note that the plane only has vertical component of velocity so

vpx=0vpx=0 and

vpy=vpvpy=vp. That is, vtotvtot vwvw vpvp vpx=0vpx=0 vpy=vpvpy=vp 3.83 and 3.84 We can use the first of these two equations to find

Because the plane is fighting a strong combination of crosswind and head-wind, it ends up with a total velocity significantly less than its velocity relative to the air mass as well as heading in a different direction. Note that in both of the last two examples, we were able to make the mathematics easier by choosing a coordinate system with one axis parallel to one of the velocities. We will repeatedly find that choosing an appropriate coordinate system makes problem solving easier. For example, in projectile motion we always use a coordinate system with one axis parallel to gravity."

Try pushing the boat from one side of the tub to the other and perpendicular to the flow of water. Which way do you need to push the boat so that it ends up immediately opposite? Compare the directions of the flow of water, heading of the boat, and actual velocity of the boat."
Page 27,"When adding velocities, we have been careful to specify that the velocity is relative to some reference frame. These velocities are called relative velocities. For example, the velocity of an airplane relative to an air mass is different from its velocity relative to the ground. Both are quite different from the velocity of an airplane relative to its passengers (which should be close to zero). Relative velocities are one aspect of relativity, which is defined to be the study of how different observers moving relative to each other measure the same phenomenon. relative velocities relativity Nearly everyone has heard of relativity and immediately associates it with Albert Einstein (1879–1955), the greatest physicist of the 20th century. Einstein revolutionized our view of nature with his modern theory of relativity, which we shall study in later chapters. The relative velocities in this section are actually aspects of classical relativity, first discussed correctly by Galileo and Isaac Newton. Classical relativity is limited to situations where speeds are less than about 1% of the speed of light—that is, less than 3,000 km/s3,000 km/s. Most things we encounter in daily life move slower than this speed. Classical relativity 3,000 km/s3,000 km/s Let us consider an example of what two different observers see in a situation analyzed long ago by Galileo. Suppose a sailor at the top of a mast on a moving ship drops their binoculars. Where will it hit the deck? Will it hit at the base of the mast, or will it hit behind the mast because the ship is moving forward? The answer is that if air resistance is negligible, the binoculars will hit at the base of the mast at a point directly below its point of release. Now let us consider what two different observers see when the binoculars drop. One observer is on the ship and the other on shore. The binoculars have no horizontal velocity relative to the observer on the ship, and so he sees them fall straight down the mast. (See Figure 3.45.) To the observer on shore, the binoculars and the ship have the same horizontal velocity, so both move the same distance forward while the binoculars are falling. This observer sees the curved path shown in Figure 3.45. Although the paths look different to the different observers, each sees the same result—the binoculars hit at the base of the mast and not behind it. To get the correct description, it is crucial to correctly specify the velocities relative to the observer. Figure 3.45 Classical relativity. The same motion as viewed by two different observers. An observer on the moving ship sees the binoculars dropped from the top of its mast fall straight down. An observer on shore sees the binoculars take the curved path, moving forward with the ship. Both observers see the binoculars strike the deck at the base of the mast. The initial horizontal velocity is different relative to the two observers. (The ship is shown moving rather fast to emphasize the effect.) Example 3.8 An airline passenger drops a coin while the plane is moving at 260 m/s. What is the velocity of the coin when it strikes the floor 1.50 m below its point of release: (a) Measured relative to the plane? (b) Measured relative to the Earth? Figure 3.46 The motion of a coin dropped inside an airplane as viewed by two different observers. (a) An observer in the plane sees the coin fall straight down. (b) An observer on the ground sees the coin move almost horizontally. Both problems can be solved with the techniques for falling objects and projectiles. In part (a), the initial velocity of the coin is zero relative to the plane, so the motion is that of a falling object (one-dimensional). In part (b), the initial velocity is 260 m/s horizontal relative to the Earth and gravity is vertical, so this motion is a projectile motion. In both parts, it is best to use a coordinate system with vertical and horizontal axes. Using the given information, we note that the initial velocity and position are zero, and the final position is 1.50 m. The final velocity can be found using the equation: 3.93 Substituting known values into the equation, we get 3.94 yielding 3.95 We know that the square root of 29.4 has two roots: 5.42  and -5.42. We choose the negative root because we know that the velocity is directed downwards, and we have defined the positive direction to be upwards. There is no initial horizontal velocity relative to the plane and no horizontal acceleration, and so the motion is straight down relative to the plane. Because the initial vertical velocity is zero relative to the ground and vertical motion is independent of horizontal motion, the final vertical velocity for the coin relative to the ground is 
vy=−5.42m/svy=−5.42m/s, the same as found in part (a). In contrast to part (a), there now is a horizontal component of the velocity. However, since there is no horizontal acceleration, the initial and final horizontal velocities are the same and


vx
=260 m/s

vx
=260 m/s. The x- and y-components of velocity can be combined to find the magnitude of the final velocity: vy=−5.42m/svy=−5.42m/s vx
=260 m/s

vx
=260 m/s 3.96 Thus, 3.97 yielding 3.98 The direction is given by: 3.99 so that 3.100 In part (a), the final velocity relative to the plane is the same as it would be if the coin were dropped from rest on the Earth and fell 1.50 m. This result fits our experience; objects in a plane fall the same way when the plane is flying horizontally as when it is at rest on the ground. This result is also true in moving cars. In part (b), an observer on the ground sees a much different motion for the coin. The plane is moving so fast horizontally to begin with that its final velocity is barely greater than the initial velocity. Once again, we see that in two dimensions, vectors do not add like ordinary numbers—the final velocity v in part (b) is not (260 – 5.42) m/s(260 – 5.42) m/s; rather, it is 260.06 m/s260.06 m/s. The velocity’s magnitude had to be calculated to five digits to see any difference from that of the airplane. The motions as seen by different observers (one in the plane and one on the ground) in this example are analogous to those discussed for the binoculars dropped from the mast of a moving ship, except that the velocity of the plane is much larger, so that the two observers see very different paths. (See Figure 3.46.) In addition, both observers see the coin fall 1.50 m vertically, but the one on the ground also sees it move forward 144 m (this calculation is left for the reader). Thus, one observer sees a vertical path, the other a nearly horizontal path. (260 – 5.42) m/s(260 – 5.42) m/s 260.06 m/s260.06 m/s Making Connections: Relativity and Einstein Because Einstein was able to clearly define how measurements are made (some involve light) and because the speed of light is the same for all observers, the outcomes are spectacularly unexpected. Time varies with observer, energy is stored as increased mass, and more surprises await."

Using the data from the figure, calculate the velocities: (a) relative to galaxy 2 and (b) relative to galaxy 5.

Page 34,"A body at rest remains at rest, or, if in motion, remains in motion at a constant velocity unless acted on by a net external force."
Page 34,"The property of a body to remain at rest or to remain in motion with constant velocity is called inertia. Newton’s first law is often called the law of inertia. As we know from experience, some objects have more inertia than others. It is obviously more difficult to change the motion of a large boulder than that of a basketball, for example. The inertia of an object is measured by its mass. Roughly speaking, mass is a measure of the amount of “stuff” (or matter) in something. The quantity or amount of matter in an object is determined by the numbers of atoms and molecules of various types it contains. Unlike weight, mass does not vary with location. The mass of an object is the same on Earth, in orbit, or on the surface of the Moon. In practice, it is very difficult to count and identify all of the atoms and molecules in an object, so masses are not often determined in this manner. Operationally, the masses of objects are determined by comparison with the standard kilogram. inertia law of inertia mass"

Page 35,"When an object is dropped, it accelerates toward the center of Earth. Newton’s second law states that a net force on an object is responsible for its acceleration. If air resistance is negligible, the net force on a falling object is the gravitational force, commonly called its weight ww. Weight can be denoted as a vector ww because it has a direction; down is, by definition, the direction of gravity, and hence weight is a downward force. The magnitude of weight is denoted as ww.  Galileo was instrumental in showing that, in the absence of air resistance, all objects fall with the same acceleration gg. Using Galileo’s result and Newton’s second law, we can derive an equation for weight. weight ww ww ww gg Consider an object with mass mm falling downward toward Earth. It experiences only the downward force of gravity, which has magnitude ww. Newton’s second law states that the magnitude of the net external force on an object is Fnet=maFnet=ma. mm ww Fnet=maFnet=ma Since the object experiences only the downward force of gravity, Fnet=wFnet=w. We know that the acceleration of an object due to gravity is gg, or a=ga=g. Substituting these into Newton’s second law gives Fnet=wFnet=w gg a=ga=g Weight This is the equation for weight—the gravitational force on a mass mm: mm 4.7 Since g=9.80 m/s2g=9.80 m/s2 on Earth, the weight of a 1.0 kg object on Earth is 9.8 N, as we see: g=9.80 m/s2g=9.80 m/s2 4.8 Recall that gg can take a positive or negative value, depending on the positive direction in the coordinate system. Be sure to take this into consideration when solving problems with weight. gg When the net external force on an object is its weight, we say that it is in free-fall. That is, the only force acting on the object is the force of gravity. In the real world, when objects fall downward toward Earth, they are never truly in free-fall because there is always some upward force from the air acting on the object. free-fall The acceleration due to gravity gg varies slightly over the surface of Earth, so that the weight of an object depends on location and is not an intrinsic property of the object. Weight varies dramatically if one leaves Earth’s surface. On the Moon, for example, the acceleration due to gravity is only 1.625m/s21.625m/s2. A 1.0-kg mass thus has a weight of 9.8 N on Earth and only about 1.7 N on the Moon. gg 1.625m/s21.625m/s2 The broadest definition of weight in this sense is that the weight of an object is the gravitational force on it from the nearest large body, such as Earth, the Moon, the Sun, and so on. This is the most common and useful definition of weight in physics. It differs dramatically, however, from the definition of weight used by NASA and the popular media in relation to space travel and exploration. When they speak of “weightlessness” and “microgravity,” they are really referring to the phenomenon we call “free-fall” in physics. We shall use the above definition of weight, and we will make careful distinctions between free-fall and actual weightlessness. It is important to be aware that weight and mass are very different physical quantities, although they are closely related. Mass is the quantity of matter (how much “stuff”) and does not vary in classical physics, whereas weight is the gravitational force and does vary depending on gravity. It is tempting to equate the two, since most of our examples take place on Earth, where the weight of an object only varies a little with the location of the object. Furthermore, the terms mass and weight are used interchangeably in everyday language; for example, our medical records often show our “weight” in kilograms, but never in the correct units of newtons. Common Misconceptions: Mass vs. Weight Mass and weight are often used interchangeably in everyday language. However, in science, these terms are distinctly different from one another. Mass is a measure of how much matter is in an object. The typical measure of mass is the kilogram (or the “slug” in English units). Weight, on the other hand, is a measure of the force of gravity acting on an object. Weight is equal to the mass of an object (mm) multiplied by the acceleration due to gravity (gg). Like any other force, weight is measured in terms of newtons (or pounds in English units). mm gg Assuming the mass of an object is kept intact, it will remain the same, regardless of its location. However, because weight depends on the acceleration due to gravity, the weight of an object can change when the object enters into a region with stronger or weaker gravity. For example, the acceleration due to gravity on the Moon is 1.625 m/s21.625 m/s2 (which is much less than the acceleration due to gravity on Earth, 9.80 m/s29.80 m/s2). If you measured your weight on Earth and then measured your weight on the Moon, you would find that you “weigh” much less, even though you do not look any skinnier. This is because the force of gravity is weaker on the Moon. In fact, when people say that they are “losing weight,” they really mean that they are losing “mass” (which in turn causes them to weigh less). 1.625 m/s21.625 m/s2 9.80 m/s29.80 m/s2 Take-Home Experiment: Mass and Weight What do bathroom scales measure? When you stand on a bathroom scale, what happens to the scale? It depresses slightly. The scale contains springs that compress in proportion to your weight—similar to rubber bands expanding when pulled. The springs provide a measure of your weight (for an object which is not accelerating). This is a force in newtons (or pounds). In most countries, the measurement is divided by 9.80 to give a reading in mass units of kilograms. The scale measures weight but is calibrated to provide information about mass. While standing on a bathroom scale, push down on a table next to you. What happens to the reading? Why? Would your scale measure the same “mass” on Earth as on the Moon? Example 4.1 Suppose that the net external force (push minus friction) exerted on a lawn mower is 51 N (about 11 lb) parallel to the ground. The mass of the mower is 24 kg. What is its acceleration? Figure 4.7 The net force on a lawn mower is 51 N to the right. At what rate does the lawn mower accelerate to the right? Since FnetFnet and mm are given, the acceleration can be calculated directly from Newton’s second law as stated in Fnet=maFnet=ma. FnetFnet mm Fnet=maFnet=ma The magnitude of the acceleration aa is a=Fnetma=Fnetm. Entering known values gives aa a=Fnetma=Fnetm 4.9 Substituting the units kg⋅m/s2kg⋅m/s2 for N yields kg⋅m/s2kg⋅m/s2 4.10 The direction of the acceleration is the same direction as that of the net force, which is parallel to the ground. There is no information given in this example about the individual external forces acting on the system, but we can say something about their relative magnitudes. For example, the force exerted by the person pushing the mower must be greater than the friction opposing the motion (since we know the mower moves forward), and the vertical forces must cancel if there is to be no acceleration in the vertical direction (the mower is moving only horizontally). The acceleration found is small enough to be reasonable for a person pushing a mower. Such an effort would not last too long because the person’s top speed would soon be reached. Example 4.2 Prior to space flights carrying astronauts, rocket sleds were used to test aircraft, missile equipment, and physiological effects on human subjects at high speeds. They consisted of a platform that was mounted on one or two rails and propelled by several rockets. Calculate the magnitude of force exerted by each rocket, called its thrust TT, for the four-rocket propulsion system shown in Figure 4.8. The sled’s initial acceleration is 49 m/s2,49 m/s2, the mass of the system is 2100 kg, and the force of friction opposing the motion is known to be 650 N. TT 49 m/s2,49 m/s2, Figure 4.8 A sled experiences a rocket thrust that accelerates it to the right. Each rocket creates an identical thrust TT. As in other situations where there is only horizontal acceleration, the vertical forces cancel. The ground exerts an upward force NN on the system that is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to its weight, ww. The system here is the sled, its rockets, and rider, so none of the forces between these objects are considered. The arrow representing friction (ff) is drawn larger than scale. Although there are forces acting vertically and horizontally, we assume the vertical forces cancel since there is no vertical acceleration. This leaves us with only horizontal forces and a simpler one-dimensional problem. Directions are indicated with plus or minus signs, with right taken as the positive direction. See the free-body diagram in the figure. Since acceleration, mass, and the force of friction are given, we start with Newton’s second law and look for ways to find the thrust of the engines. Since we have defined the direction of the force and acceleration as acting “to the right,” we need to consider only the magnitudes of these quantities in the calculations. Hence we begin with 4.11 where FnetFnet is the net force along the horizontal direction. We can see from Figure 4.8 that the engine thrusts add, while friction opposes the thrust. In equation form, the net external force is FnetFnet 4.12 Substituting this into Newton’s second law gives 4.13 Using a little algebra, we solve for the total thrust 4T: 4.14 Substituting known values yields 4.15 So the total thrust is 4.16 and the individual thrusts are 4.17 The numbers are quite large, so the result might surprise you. Experiments such as this were performed in the early 1960s to test the limits of human endurance and the setup designed to protect human subjects in jet fighter emergency ejections. Speeds of 1000 km/h were obtained, with accelerations of 45 gg's. (Recall that gg, the acceleration due to gravity, is 9.80 m/s29.80 m/s2. When we say that an acceleration is 45 gg's, it is 45×9.80 m/s245×9.80 m/s2, which is approximately 440 m/s2440 m/s2.) While living subjects are not used any more, land speeds of 10,000 km/h have been obtained with rocket sleds. In this example, as in the preceding one, the system of interest is obvious. We will see in later examples that choosing the system of interest is crucial—and the choice is not always obvious. gg gg 9.80 m/s29.80 m/s2 gg 45×9.80 m/s245×9.80 m/s2 440 m/s2440 m/s2 Newton’s second law of motion is more than a definition; it is a relationship among acceleration, force, and mass. It can help us make predictions. Each of those physical quantities can be defined independently, so the second law tells us something basic and universal about nature. The next section introduces the third and final law of motion."

Page 37,"Weight (also called force of gravity) is a pervasive force that acts at all times and must be counteracted to keep an object from falling. You definitely notice that you must support the weight of a heavy object by pushing up on it when you hold it stationary, as illustrated in Figure 4.11(a). But how do inanimate objects like a table support the weight of a mass placed on them, such as shown in Figure 4.11(b)? When the bag of dog food is placed on the table, the table actually sags slightly under the load. This would be noticeable if the load were placed on a card table, but even rigid objects deform when a force is applied to them. Unless the object is deformed beyond its limit, it will exert a restoring force much like a deformed spring (or trampoline or diving board). The greater the deformation, the greater the restoring force. So when the load is placed on the table, the table sags until the restoring force becomes as large as the weight of the load. At this point the net external force on the load is zero. That is the situation when the load is stationary on the table. The table sags quickly, and the sag is slight so we do not notice it. But it is similar to the sagging of a trampoline when you climb onto it. Weight Figure 4.11 (a) The person holding the bag of dog food must supply an upward force FhandFhand equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the weight of the food ww. (b) The card table sags when the dog food is placed on it, much like a stiff trampoline. Elastic restoring forces in the table grow as it sags until they supply a force NN equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the weight of the load. We must conclude that whatever supports a load, be it animate or not, must supply an upward force equal to the weight of the load, as we assumed in a few of the previous examples. If the force supporting a load is perpendicular to the surface of contact between the load and its support, this force is defined to be a normal force and here is given the symbol NN. (This is not the unit for force N.) The word normal means perpendicular to a surface. The normal force can be less than the object’s weight if the object is on an incline, as you will see in the next example. normal force NN Common Misconception: Normal Force (N) vs. Newton (N) In this section we have introduced the quantity normal force, which is represented by the variable NN. This should not be confused with the symbol for the newton, which is also represented by the letter N. These symbols are particularly important to distinguish because the units of a normal force (NN) happen to be newtons (N). For example, the normal force NN that the floor exerts on a chair might be N=100 NN=100 N. One important difference is that normal force is a vector, while the newton is simply a unit. Be careful not to confuse these letters in your calculations! You will encounter more similarities among variables and units as you proceed in physics. Another example of this is the quantity work (WW) and the unit watts (W). NN NN NN N=100 NN=100 N WW Example 4.5 Consider the skier on a slope shown in Figure 4.12. Her mass including equipment is 60.0 kg. (a) What is her acceleration if friction is negligible? (b) What is her acceleration if friction is known to be 45.0 N? Figure 4.12 Since motion and friction are parallel to the slope, it is most convenient to project all forces onto a coordinate system where one axis is parallel to the slope and the other is perpendicular (axes shown to left of skier). NN is perpendicular to the slope and f is parallel to the slope, but ww has components along both axes, namely w⊥w⊥ and w∥ w∥ . NN is equal in magnitude to w⊥w⊥, so that there is no motion perpendicular to the slope, but ff is less than w∥ w∥ , so that there is a downslope acceleration (along the parallel axis). This is a two-dimensional problem, since the forces on the skier (the system of interest) are not parallel. The approach we have used in two-dimensional kinematics also works very well here. Choose a convenient coordinate system and project the vectors onto its axes, creating two connected one-dimensional problems to solve. The most convenient coordinate system for motion on an incline is one that has one coordinate parallel to the slope and one perpendicular to the slope. (Remember that motions along mutually perpendicular axes are independent.) We use the symbols ⊥⊥  and ∥ ∥  to represent perpendicular and parallel, respectively. This choice of axes simplifies this type of problem, because there is no motion perpendicular to the slope and because friction is always parallel to the surface between two objects. The only external forces acting on the system are the skier’s weight, friction, and the support of the slope, respectively labeled ww, ff, and NN in Figure 4.12. NN is always perpendicular to the slope, and ff is parallel to it. But ww is not in the direction of either axis, and so the first step we take is to project it into components along the chosen axes, defining w∥ w∥  to be the component of weight parallel to the slope and w⊥w⊥ the component of weight perpendicular to the slope. Once this is done, we can consider the two separate problems of forces parallel to the slope and forces perpendicular to the slope. ⊥⊥ ∥ ∥ ww ff NN NN ff ww w∥ w∥ w⊥w⊥ The magnitude of the component of the weight parallel to the slope is w∥ =wsin(25º)=mgsin(25º)w∥ =wsin(25º)=mgsin(25º), and the magnitude of the component of the weight perpendicular to the slope is w⊥=wcos(25º)=mgcos(25º)w⊥=wcos(25º)=mgcos(25º). w∥ =wsin(25º)=mgsin(25º)w∥ =wsin(25º)=mgsin(25º) w⊥=wcos(25º)=mgcos(25º)w⊥=wcos(25º)=mgcos(25º) (a) Neglecting friction. Since the acceleration is parallel to the slope, we need only consider forces parallel to the slope. (Forces perpendicular to the slope add to zero, since there is no acceleration in that direction.) The forces parallel to the slope are the amount of the skier’s weight parallel to the slope w∥ w∥  and friction ff. Using Newton’s second law, with subscripts to denote quantities parallel to the slope, w∥ w∥ ff 4.30 where Fnet ∥ =w∥ =mgsin(25º)Fnet ∥ =w∥ =mgsin(25º), assuming no friction for this part, so that Fnet ∥ =w∥ =mgsin(25º)Fnet ∥ =w∥ =mgsin(25º) 4.31 4.32 is the acceleration. (b) Including friction. We now have a given value for friction, and we know its direction is parallel to the slope and it opposes motion between surfaces in contact. So the net external force is now 4.33 and substituting this into Newton’s second law, a∥ =Fnet ∥ ma∥ =Fnet ∥ m, gives a∥ =Fnet ∥ ma∥ =Fnet ∥ m 4.34 We substitute known values to obtain 4.35 which yields 4.36 which is the acceleration parallel to the incline when there is 45.0 N of opposing friction. Since friction always opposes motion between surfaces, the acceleration is smaller when there is friction than when there is none. In fact, it is a general result that if friction on an incline is negligible, then the acceleration down the incline is a=gsinθa=gsinθ, regardless of mass. This is related to the previously discussed fact that all objects fall with the same acceleration in the absence of air resistance. Similarly, all objects, regardless of mass, slide down a frictionless incline with the same acceleration (if the angle is the same). a=gsinθa=gsinθ Resolving Weight into Components Figure 4.13 An object rests on an incline that makes an angle θ with the horizontal. When an object rests on an incline that makes an angle θθ with the horizontal, the force of gravity acting on the object is divided into two components: a force acting perpendicular to the plane,
  
  
  w⊥w⊥, and a force acting parallel to the plane,
  
  
   w∥ w∥ . The perpendicular force of weight,
  
  
  w⊥w⊥,
  
  is typically equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the normal force,
  
  NN. The force acting parallel to the plane,
  
  
  w∥ w∥ , causes the object to accelerate down the incline. The force of friction,
  
  
  ff, opposes the motion of the object, so it acts upward along the plane. θθ w⊥w⊥ w∥ w∥ w⊥w⊥ NN w∥ w∥ ff It is important to be careful when resolving the weight of the object into components. If the angle of the incline is at an angle θθ to the horizontal, then the magnitudes of the weight components are θθ 4.37 and 4.38 Instead of memorizing these equations, it is helpful to be able to determine them from reason. To do this, draw the right triangle formed by the three weight vectors. Notice that the angle θθ of the incline is the same as the angle formed between ww and w⊥w⊥. Knowing this property, you can use trigonometry to determine the magnitude of the weight components: θθ ww w⊥w⊥ 4.39 4.40 Take-Home Experiment: Force Parallel To investigate how a force parallel to an inclined plane changes, find a rubber band, some objects to hang from the end of the rubber band, and a board you can position at different angles. How much does the rubber band stretch when you hang the object from the end of the board? Now place the board at an angle so that the object slides off when placed on the board. How much does the rubber band extend if it is lined up parallel to the board and used to hold the object stationary on the board? Try two more angles. What does this show?"

Page 37,"A tension is a force along the length of a medium, especially a force carried by a flexible medium, such as a rope or cable. The word “tension” comes from a Latin word meaning “to stretch.” Not coincidentally, the flexible cords that carry muscle forces to other parts of the body are called tendons. Any flexible connector, such as a string, rope, chain, wire, or cable, can exert pulls only parallel to its length; thus, a force carried by a flexible connector is a tension with direction parallel to the connector. It is important to understand that tension is a pull in a connector. In contrast, consider the phrase: “You can’t push a rope.” The tension force pulls outward along the two ends of a rope. tension Consider a person holding a mass on a rope as shown in Figure 4.14. Figure 4.14 When a perfectly flexible connector (one requiring no force to bend it) such as this rope transmits a force TT, that force must be parallel to the length of the rope, as shown. The pull such a flexible connector exerts is a tension. Note that the rope pulls with equal force but in opposite directions on the hand and the supported mass (neglecting the weight of the rope). This is an example of Newton’s third law. The rope is the medium that carries the equal and opposite forces between the two objects. The tension anywhere in the rope between the hand and the mass is equal. Once you have determined the tension in one location, you have determined the tension at all locations along the rope. Tension in the rope must equal the weight of the supported mass, as we can prove using Newton’s second law. If the 5.00-kg mass in the figure is stationary, then its acceleration is zero, and thus Fnet=0Fnet=0. The only external forces acting on the mass are its weight ww and the tension TT supplied by the rope. Thus, Fnet=0Fnet=0 ww TT 4.41 where TT and ww are the magnitudes of the tension and weight and their signs indicate direction, with up being positive here. Thus, just as you would expect, the tension equals the weight of the supported mass: TT ww 4.42 For a 5.00-kg mass, then (neglecting the mass of the rope) we see that 4.43 If we cut the rope and insert a spring, the spring would extend a length corresponding to a force of 49.0 N, providing a direct observation and measure of the tension force in the rope. Flexible connectors are often used to transmit forces around corners, such as in a hospital traction system, a finger joint, or a bicycle brake cable. If there is no friction, the tension is transmitted undiminished. Only its direction changes, and it is always parallel to the flexible connector. This is illustrated in Figure 4.15 (a) and (b). Figure 4.15 (a) Tendons in the finger carry force TT from the muscles to other parts of the finger, usually changing the force’s direction, but not its magnitude (the tendons are relatively friction free). (b) The brake cable on a bicycle carries the tension TT from the handlebars to the brake mechanism. Again, the direction but not the magnitude of TT is changed. Example 4.6 Calculate the tension in the wire supporting the 70.0-kg tightrope walker shown in Figure 4.16. Figure 4.16 The weight of a tightrope walker causes a wire to sag by 5.0 degrees. The system of interest here is the point in the wire at which the tightrope walker is standing. As you can see in the figure, the wire is not perfectly horizontal (it cannot be!), but is bent under the person’s weight. Thus, the tension on either side of the person has an upward component that can support his weight. As usual, forces are vectors represented pictorially by arrows having the same directions as the forces and lengths proportional to their magnitudes. The system is the tightrope walker, and the only external forces acting on him are his weight ww and the two tensions TLTL (left  tension) and TRTR (right tension), as illustrated. It is reasonable to neglect the weight of the wire itself. The net external force is zero since the system is stationary. A little trigonometry can now be used to find the tensions. One conclusion is possible at the outset—we can see from part (b) of the figure that the magnitudes of the tensions TLTL and TRTR must be equal. This is because there is no horizontal acceleration in the rope, and the only forces acting to the left and right are TLTL and TRTR. Thus, the magnitude of those forces must be equal so that they cancel each other out. ww TLTL TRTR TLTL TRTR TLTL TRTR Whenever we have two-dimensional vector problems in which no two vectors are parallel, the easiest method of solution is to pick a convenient coordinate system and project the vectors onto its axes. In this case the best coordinate system has one axis horizontal and the other vertical. We call the horizontal the xx-axis  and the vertical the yy-axis. xx yy First, we need to resolve the tension vectors into their horizontal and vertical components. It helps to draw a new free-body diagram showing all of the horizontal and vertical components of each force acting on the system. Figure 4.17 When the vectors are projected onto vertical and horizontal axes, their components along those axes must add to zero, since the tightrope walker is stationary. The small angle results in TT being much greater than ww. Consider the horizontal components of the forces (denoted with a subscript xx): xx 4.44 The net external horizontal force Fnet 
x=0Fnet 
x=0, since the person is stationary. Thus, Fnet 
x=0Fnet 
x=0 4.45 Now, observe Figure 4.17. You can use trigonometry to determine the magnitude of TLTL and TRTR. Notice that: TLTL TRTR 4.46 Equating TL
xTL
x and TRxTRx: TL
xTL
x TRxTRx 4.47 Thus, 4.48 as predicted. Now, considering the vertical components (denoted by a subscript yy), we can solve for TT. Again, since the person is stationary, Newton’s second law implies that net Fy=0Fy=0. Thus, as illustrated in the free-body diagram in Figure 4.17, yy TT Fy=0Fy=0 4.49 Observing Figure 4.17, we can use trigonometry to determine the relationship between
  
  TLyTLy,
  
  TRyTRy,
  
  
  and TT.
  
  As we determined from the analysis in the horizontal direction,
  
  
  TL=TR=TTL=TR=T: TLyTLy TRyTRy TT TL=TR=TTL=TR=T 4.50 Now, we can substitute the values for TLyTLy and TRyTRy, into the net force equation in the vertical direction: TLyTLy TRyTRy 4.51 and 4.52 so that 4.53 and the tension is 4.54 Note that the vertical tension in the wire acts as a normal force that supports the weight of the tightrope walker. The tension is almost six times the 686-N weight of the tightrope walker. Since the wire is nearly horizontal, the vertical component of its tension is only a small fraction of the tension in the wire. The large horizontal components are in opposite directions and cancel, and so most of the tension in the wire is not used to support the weight of the tightrope walker. If we wish to create a very large tension, all we have to do is exert a force perpendicular to a flexible connector, as illustrated in Figure 4.18. As we saw in the last example, the weight of the tightrope walker acted as a force perpendicular to the rope. We saw that the tension in the roped related to the weight of the tightrope walker in the following way: 4.55 We can extend this expression to describe the tension TT created when a perpendicular force (F⊥F⊥) is exerted at the middle of a flexible connector: TT F⊥F⊥ 4.56 Note that θθ is the angle between the horizontal and the bent connector. In this case, TT becomes very large as θθ approaches zero. Even the relatively small weight of any flexible connector will cause it to sag, since an infinite tension would result if it were horizontal (i.e.,
  θ=0θ=0 and sinθ=0sinθ=0). (See Figure 4.18.) θθ TT θθ θ=0θ=0 sinθ=0sinθ=0 Figure 4.18 We can create a very large tension in the chain by pushing on it perpendicular to its length, as shown. Suppose we wish to pull a car out of the mud when no tow truck is available. Each time the car moves forward, the chain is tightened to keep it as nearly straight as possible. The tension in the chain is given by T=F⊥2sin(θ)T=F⊥2sin(θ) ; since θθ is small, TT is very large. This situation is analogous to the tightrope walker shown in Figure 4.16, except that the tensions shown here are those transmitted to the car and the tree rather than those acting at the point where F⊥F⊥ is applied. Figure 4.19 Unless an infinite tension is exerted, any flexible connector—such as the chain at the bottom of the picture—will sag under its own weight, giving a characteristic curve when the weight is evenly distributed along the length. Suspension bridges—such as the Golden Gate Bridge shown in this image—are essentially very heavy flexible connectors. The weight of the bridge is evenly distributed along the length of flexible connectors, usually cables, which take on the characteristic shape. (credit: Leaflet, Wikimedia Commons)"
Page 37,"There is another distinction among forces in addition to the types already mentioned. Some forces are real, whereas others are not. Real forces are those that have some physical origin, such as the gravitational pull. Contrastingly, fictitious forces are those that arise simply because an observer is in an accelerating frame of reference, such as one that rotates (like a merry-go-round) or undergoes linear acceleration (like a car slowing down). For example, if a satellite is heading due north above Earth’s northern hemisphere, then to an observer on Earth it will appear to experience a force to the west that has no physical origin. Of course, what is happening here is that Earth is rotating toward the east and moves east under the satellite. In Earth’s frame this looks like a westward force on the satellite, or it can be interpreted as a violation of Newton’s first law (the law of inertia). An inertial frame of reference is one in which all forces are real and, equivalently, one in which Newton’s laws have the simple forms given in this chapter. inertial frame of reference Earth’s rotation is slow enough that Earth is nearly an inertial frame. You ordinarily must perform precise experiments to observe fictitious forces and the slight departures from Newton’s laws, such as the effect just described. On the large scale, such as for the rotation of weather systems and ocean currents, the effects can be easily observed. The crucial factor in determining whether a frame of reference is inertial is whether it accelerates or rotates relative to a known inertial frame. Unless stated otherwise, all phenomena discussed in this text are considered in inertial frames. All the forces discussed in this section are real forces, but there are a number of other real forces, such as lift and thrust, that are not discussed in this section. They are more specialized, and it is not necessary to discuss every type of force. It is natural, however, to ask where the basic simplicity we seek to find in physics is in the long list of forces. Are some more basic than others? Are some different manifestations of the same underlying force? The answer to both questions is yes, as will be seen in the next (extended) section and in the treatment of modern physics later in the text."

Page 38,"Step 1. As usual, it is first necessary to identify the physical principles involved. Once it is determined that Newton’s laws of motion are involved (if the problem involves forces), it is particularly important to draw a careful sketch of the situation. Such a sketch is shown in Figure 4.20(a). Then, as in Figure 4.20(b), use arrows to represent all forces, label them carefully, and make their lengths and directions correspond to the forces they represent (whenever sufficient information exists). Figure 4.20 (a) A sketch of Tarzan hanging from a vine. (b) Arrows are used to represent all forces. TT is the tension in the vine above Tarzan, FTFT is the force he exerts on the vine, and ww is his weight. All other forces, such as the nudge of a breeze, are assumed negligible. (c) Suppose we are given the ape man’s mass and asked to find the tension in the vine. We then define the system of interest as shown and draw a free-body diagram. FTFT is no longer shown, because it is not a force acting on the system of interest; rather, FTFT acts on the outside world. (d) Showing only the arrows, the head-to-tail method of addition is used. It is apparent that T=-wT=-w, if Tarzan is stationary. Step 2. Identify what needs to be determined and what is known or can be inferred from the problem as stated. That is, make a list of knowns and unknowns. Then carefully determine the system of interest. This decision is a crucial step, since Newton’s second law involves only external forces. Once the system of interest has been identified, it becomes possible to determine which forces are external and which are internal, a necessary step to employ Newton’s second law. (See Figure 4.20(c).) Newton’s third law may be used to identify whether forces are exerted between components of a system (internal) or between the system and something outside (external). As illustrated earlier in this chapter, the system of interest depends on what question we need to answer. This choice becomes easier with practice, eventually developing into an almost unconscious process. Skill in clearly defining systems will be beneficial in later chapters as well.
      A diagram showing the system of interest and all of the external forces is called a free-body diagram. Only forces are shown on free-body diagrams, not acceleration or velocity. We have drawn several of these in worked examples. Figure 4.20(c) shows a free-body diagram for the system of interest. Note that no internal forces are shown in a free-body diagram. free-body diagram Step 3. Once a free-body diagram is drawn, Newton’s second law can be applied to solve the problem. This is done in Figure 4.20(d) for a particular situation. In general, once external forces are clearly identified in free-body diagrams, it should be a straightforward task to put them into equation form and solve for the unknown, as done in all previous examples. If the problem is one-dimensional—that is, if all forces are parallel—then they add like scalars. If the problem is two-dimensional, then it must be broken down into a pair of one-dimensional problems. This is done by projecting the force vectors onto a set of axes chosen for convenience. As seen in previous examples, the choice of axes can simplify the problem. For example, when an incline is involved, a set of axes with one axis parallel to the incline and one perpendicular to it is most convenient. It is almost always convenient to make one axis parallel to the direction of motion, if this is known. Applying Newton’s Second Law Before you write net force equations, it is critical to determine whether the system is accelerating in a particular direction. If the acceleration is zero in a particular direction, then the net force is zero in that direction. Similarly, if the acceleration is nonzero in a particular direction, then the net force is described by the equation: Fnet=maFnet=ma. Fnet=maFnet=ma For example, if the system is accelerating in the horizontal direction, but it is not accelerating in the vertical direction, then you will have the following conclusions: 4.57 4.58 You will need this information in order to determine unknown forces acting in a system. Step 4. As always, check the solution to see whether it is reasonable. In some cases, this is obvious. For example, it is reasonable to find that friction causes an object to slide down an incline more slowly than when no friction exists. In practice, intuition develops gradually through problem solving, and with experience it becomes progressively easier to judge whether an answer is reasonable. Another way to check your solution is to check the units. If you are solving for force and end up with units of m/s, then you have made a mistake."

The first tugboat exerts a force of 2.7×105 N2.7×105 N in the x-direction, and the second tugboat exerts a force of 3.6×105 N3.6×105 N in the y-direction. 2.7×105 N2.7×105 N 3.6×105 N3.6×105 N Figure 4.21 (a) A view from above of two tugboats pushing on a barge.

It omits the two vertical forces—the weight of the barge and the buoyant force of the water supporting it cancel and are not shown. Since the applied forces are perpendicular, the x- and y-axes are in the same direction as FxFx and FyFy. The problem quickly becomes a one-dimensional problem along the direction of FappFapp, since friction is in the direction opposite to FappFapp. If the mass of the barge is 5.0×106 kg5.0×106 kg and its acceleration is observed to be 7.5×10−2 m/s27.5×10−2 m/s2 in the direction shown, what is the drag force of the water on the barge resisting the motion?

The system of interest here is the barge, since the forces on it are given as well as its acceleration. Our strategy is to find the magnitude and direction of the net applied force FappFapp, and then apply Newton’s second law to solve for the drag force FDFD. FDFD FappFapp FappFapp FDFD Since FxFx and FyFy are perpendicular, the magnitude and direction of FappFapp are easily found. First, the resultant magnitude is given by the Pythagorean theorem: FxFx FyFy FappFapp 4.60 The angle is given by 4.61 which we know, because of Newton’s first law, is the same direction as the acceleration. FDFD is in the opposite direction of FappFapp, since it acts to slow down the acceleration. Therefore, the net external force is in the same direction as FappFapp, but its magnitude is slightly less than FappFapp. The problem is now one-dimensional. From Figure 4.21(b), we can see that FDFD FappFapp FappFapp FappFapp 4.62 But Newton’s second law states that 4.63 Thus, 4.64 This can be solved for the magnitude of the drag force of the water FDFD in terms of known quantities: FDFD 4.65 Substituting known values gives 4.66 The direction of FDFD has already been determined to be in the direction opposite to FappFapp, or at an angle of 53º53º south of west. FDFD FappFapp 53º53º The numbers used in this example are reasonable for a moderately large barge. It is certainly difficult to obtain larger accelerations with tugboats, and small speeds are desirable to avoid running the barge into the docks. Drag is relatively small for a well-designed hull at low speeds, consistent with the answer to this example, where FDFD is less than 1/600th of the weight of the ship. FDFD"
Page 39,"Physics is most interesting and most powerful when applied to general situations that involve more than a narrow set of physical principles. Newton’s laws of motion can also be integrated with other concepts that have been discussed previously in this text to solve problems of motion. For example, forces produce accelerations, a topic of kinematics, and hence the relevance of earlier chapters. When approaching problems that involve various types of forces, acceleration, velocity, and/or position, use the following steps to approach the problem: Problem-Solving Strategy Step 1. Identify which physical principles are involved. Listing the givens and the quantities to be calculated will allow you to identify the principles involved.
Step 2. Solve the problem using strategies outlined in the text. If these are available for the specific topic, you should refer to them. You should also refer to the sections of the text that deal with a particular topic. The following worked example illustrates how these strategies are applied to an integrated concept problem. Example 4.10 A soccer player starts from rest and accelerates forward, reaching a velocity of 8.00 m/s in 2.50 s. (a) What was his average acceleration? (b) What average force did he exert backward on the ground to achieve this acceleration? The player’s mass is 70.0 kg, and air resistance is negligible. The following solutions to each part of the example illustrate how the specific problem-solving strategies are applied. These involve identifying knowns and unknowns, checking to see if the answer is reasonable, and so forth. We are given the initial and final velocities (zero and 8.00 m/s forward); thus, the change in velocity is Δv=8.00 m/sΔv=8.00 m/s. We are given the elapsed time, and so Δt=2.50 sΔt=2.50 s. The unknown is acceleration, which can be found from its definition: Δv=8.00 m/sΔv=8.00 m/s Δt=2.50 sΔt=2.50 s 4.88 Substituting the known values yields 4.89 This is an attainable acceleration for an athlete in good condition. Here we are asked to find the average force the player exerts backward to achieve this forward acceleration. Neglecting air resistance, this would be equal in magnitude to the net external force on the player, since this force causes his acceleration. Since we now know the player’s acceleration and are given his mass, we can use Newton’s second law to find the force exerted. That is, 4.90 Substituting the known values of mm and aa gives mm aa 4.91 This is about 50 pounds, a reasonable average force. This worked example illustrates how to apply problem-solving strategies to situations that include topics from different chapters. The first step is to identify the physical principles involved in the problem. The second step is to solve for the unknown using familiar problem-solving strategies. These strategies are found throughout the text, and many worked examples show how to use them for single topics. You will find these techniques for integrated concept problems useful in applications of physics outside of a physics course, such as in your profession, in other science disciplines, and in everyday life. The following problems will build your skills in the broad application of physical principles."

Page 40,"The four basic forces will be encountered in more detail as you progress through the text. The gravitational force is defined in Uniform Circular Motion and Gravitation, electric force in Electric Charge and Electric Field, magnetic force in Magnetism, and nuclear forces in Radioactivity and Nuclear Physics. On a macroscopic scale, electromagnetism and gravity are the basis for all forces. The nuclear forces are vital to the substructure of matter, but they are not directly experienced on the macroscopic scale."
Page 40,"All forces act at a distance. This is obvious for the gravitational force. Earth and the Moon, for example, interact without coming into contact. It is also true for all other forces. Friction, for example, is an electromagnetic force between atoms that may not actually touch. What is it that carries forces between objects? One way to answer this question is to imagine that a force field surrounds whatever object creates the force. A second object (often called a test object) placed in this field will experience a force that is a function of location and other variables. The field itself is the “thing” that carries the force from one object to another. The field is defined so as to be a characteristic of the object creating it; the field does not depend on the test object placed in it. Earth’s gravitational field, for example, is a function of the mass of Earth and the distance from its center, independent of the presence of other masses. The concept of a field is useful because equations can be written for force fields surrounding objects (for gravity, this yields w=mgw=mg at Earth’s surface), and motions can be calculated from these equations. (See Figure 4.24.) force field w=mgw=mg Figure 4.24 The electric force field between a positively charged particle and a negatively charged particle. When a positive test charge is placed in the field, the charge will experience a force in the direction of the force field lines. Concept Connections: Force Fields The concept of a force field is also used in connection with electric charge and is presented in Electric Charge and Electric Field. It is also a useful idea for all the basic forces, as will be seen in Particle Physics. Fields help us to visualize forces and how they are transmitted, as well as to describe them with precision and to link forces with subatomic carrier particles. The field concept has been applied very successfully; we can calculate motions and describe nature to high precision using field equations. As useful as the field concept is, however, it leaves unanswered the question of what carries the force. It has been proposed in recent decades, starting in 1935 with Hideki Yukawa’s (1907–1981) work on the strong nuclear force, that all forces are transmitted by the exchange of elementary particles. We can visualize particle exchange as analogous to macroscopic phenomena such as two people passing a basketball back and forth, thereby exerting a repulsive force without touching one another. (See Figure 4.25.) Figure 4.25 The exchange of masses resulting in repulsive forces. (a) The person throwing the basketball exerts a force Fp1Fp1 on it toward the other person and feels a reaction force
FBFB away from the second person. (b) The person catching the basketball exerts a force
Fp2Fp2 on it to stop the ball and feels a reaction force
F′BF′B away from the first person. (c) The analogous exchange of a meson between a proton and a neutron carries the strong nuclear forces FexchFexch and F′exchF′exch between them. An attractive force can also be exerted by the exchange of a mass—if person 2 pulled the basketball away from the first person as he tried to retain it, then the force between them would be attractive. This idea of particle exchange deepens rather than contradicts field concepts. It is more satisfying philosophically to think of something physical actually moving between objects acting at a distance. Table 4.1 lists the exchange or carrier particles, both observed and proposed, that carry the four forces. But the real fruit of the particle-exchange proposal is that searches for Yukawa’s proposed particle found it and a number of others that were completely unexpected, stimulating yet more research. All of this research eventually led to the proposal of quarks as the underlying substructure of matter, which is a basic tenet of GUTs. If successful, these theories will explain not only forces, but also the structure of matter itself. Yet physics is an experimental science, so the test of these theories must lie in the domain of the real world. As of this writing, scientists at the CERN laboratory in Switzerland are starting to test these theories using the world’s largest particle accelerator: the Large Hadron Collider. This accelerator (27 km in circumference) allows two high-energy proton beams, traveling in opposite directions, to collide. An energy of 14 trillion electron volts will be available. It is anticipated that some new particles, possibly force carrier particles, will be found. (See Figure 4.26.) One of the force carriers of high interest that researchers hope to detect is the Higgs boson. The observation of its properties might tell us why different particles have different masses. carrier particles Figure 4.26 The world’s largest particle accelerator spans the border between Switzerland and France. Two beams, traveling in opposite directions close to the speed of light, collide in a tube similar to the central tube shown here. External magnets determine the beam’s path. Special detectors will analyze particles created in these collisions. Questions as broad as what is the origin of mass and what was matter like the first few seconds of our universe will be explored. This accelerator began preliminary operation in 2008. (credit: Frank Hommes) Tiny particles also have wave-like behavior, something we will explore more in a later chapter. To better understand force-carrier particles from another perspective, let us consider gravity. The search for gravitational waves has been going on for a number of years. Over 100 years ago, Einstein predicted the existence of these waves as part of his general theory of relativity. Gravitational waves are created during the collision of massive stars, in black holes, or in supernova explosions—like shock waves. These gravitational waves will travel through space from such sites much like a pebble dropped into a pond sends out ripples—except these waves move at the speed of light. A detector apparatus has been built in the U.S., consisting of two large installations nearly 3000 km apart—one in Washington state and one in Louisiana! The facility is called the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). Each installation is designed to use optical lasers to examine any slight shift in the relative positions of two masses due to the effect of gravity waves. The two sites allow simultaneous measurements of these small effects to be separated from other natural phenomena, such as earthquakes. Initial operation of the detectors began in 2002, and work is proceeding on increasing their sensitivity. Similar installations have been built in Italy (VIRGO), Germany (GEO600), and Japan (TAMA300) to provide a worldwide network of gravitational wave detectors. In September, 2015, LIGO fulfilled its promise and helped prove Einstein's predictions. The system detected the first gravitational waves arising from the merger of two black holes—one 29 times the mass of our Sun and the other 36 times the mass of our Sun—that occurred 1.3 billion years ago. About 3 times the mass of the Sun was converted into gravitational waves in a fraction of a second—with a peak power output about 50 times that of the whole visible universe. Due to the 7 millisecond delay in detection, researchers established that the merger occurred on the southern hemisphere side of Earth. Since then, LIGO and VIRGO have combined to detect about a dozen similar events, with better and more precise measurements. Waves from neutron star mergers and different-sized black holes have deepened our understanding of these objects and their impact on the universe. International collaboration in this area is moving into space with the joint EU/US project LISA (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna). Earthquakes and other Earthly noises will be no problem for these monitoring spacecraft. LISA will complement LIGO by looking at much more massive black holes through the observation of gravitational-wave sources emitting much larger wavelengths. Three satellites will be placed in space above Earth in an equilateral triangle (with 5,000,000-km sides) (Figure 4.27). The system will measure the relative positions of each satellite to detect passing gravitational waves. Accuracy to within 10% of the size of an atom will be needed to detect any waves. The launch of this project will likely be in the 2030s. Figure 4.27 Space-based future experiments for the measurement of gravitational waves. Shown here is a drawing of LISA’s orbit. Each satellite of LISA will consist of a laser source and a mass. The lasers will transmit a signal to measure the distance between each satellite’s test mass. The relative motion of these masses will provide information about passing gravitational waves. (credit: NASA) As you can see above, some of the most groundbreaking developments in physics are made with a relatively long gap from theoretical prediction to experimental detection. This pattern continues the process of science from its earliest days, where early thinkers and researchers made discoveries that only led to more questions. Einstein was unique in many ways, but he was not unique in that later scientists, building on his and each other's work, would prove his theories. Evidence for black holes became more and more concrete as scientists developed new and better ways to look for them. Some of the most prominent have been Roger Penrose, who developed new mathematical models related to black holes, as well as Reinhard Genzel and Andrea Ghez, who independently used telescope observations to identify a region of our galaxy where a massive unseen gravity source (4 million times the size of our Sun) was pulling on stars. And soon after, collaborators on the Event Horizon Telescope project produced the first actual image of a black hole. Figure 4.28 This updated image of the supermassive black hole at the center of the M87 galaxy shows the polarization created by the powerful magnetic field that surrounds the object. The image was created by the Event Horizon Telescope, which combines data from telescopes around the world. The project involves over 200 researchers and produced the first image of a black hole in 2019. (credit: EHT Collaboration/NASA APOD)"

What force is exerted on the tooth in Figure 4.37 if the tension in the wire is 25.0 N?

(b) What is the strength of the weak nuclear force relative to the electromagnetic force? Since the weak nuclear force acts at only very short distances, such as inside nuclei, where the strong and electromagnetic forces also act, it might seem surprising that we have any knowledge of it at all. We have such knowledge because the weak nuclear force is responsible for beta decay, a type of nuclear decay not explained by other forces. 53 .

(c) What is the ratio of the strength of the gravitational force to that of the electromagnetic force? What do your answers imply about the influence of the gravitational force on atomic nuclei? . What is the ratio of the strength of the strong nuclear force to that of the electromagnetic force? Based on this ratio, you might expect that the strong force dominates the nucleus, which is true for small nuclei. Large nuclei, however, have sizes greater than the range of the strong nuclear force. At these sizes, the electromagnetic force begins to affect nuclear stability. These facts will be used to explain nuclear fusion and fission later in this text. .

(b) Based on experimental data, an equation that fits the data is suggested for the final speed, V, which may not be correct: V=KFV=KF, where K is a constant with appropriate units and F is the horizontal applied force. Is this equation consistent with your answer from part a? Explain why or why not. Does this equation make sense? Explain why or why not. (c) Now the applied force can be any value and the distance from the starting point is measured when the speed gets to a consistent value.

Page 48,"A change in length ΔLΔL is produced when a force is applied to a wire or rod parallel to its length L0L0, either stretching it (a tension) or compressing it. (See Figure 5.13.) ΔLΔL L0L0 Figure 5.13 (a) Tension. The rod is stretched a length ΔLΔL when a force is applied parallel to its length. (b) Compression. The same rod is compressed by forces with the same magnitude in the opposite direction. For very small deformations and uniform materials, ΔLΔL is approximately the same for the same magnitude of tension or compression. For larger deformations, the cross-sectional area changes as the rod is compressed or stretched. Experiments have shown that the change in length (ΔLΔL) depends on only a few variables. As already noted, ΔLΔL is proportional to the force FF and depends on the substance from which the object is made. Additionally, the change in length is proportional to the original length L0L0 and inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area of the wire or rod. For example, a long guitar string will stretch more than a short one, and a thick string will stretch less than a thin one. We can combine all these factors into one equation for ΔLΔL: ΔLΔL ΔLΔL FF L0L0 ΔLΔL 5.30 where ΔL ΔL  is the change in length, FF the applied force, YY is a factor, called the elastic modulus or Young’s modulus, that depends on the substance, AA is the cross-sectional area, and L0L0 is the original length. Table 5.3 lists values of YY  for several materials—those with a large YY  are said to have a large tensile stiffness because they deform less for a given tension or compression. ΔL ΔL FF YY AA L0L0 YY YY Table 5.3 Elastic Moduli1 Young’s moduli are not listed for liquids and gases in Table 5.3 because they cannot be stretched or compressed in only one direction. Note that there is an assumption that the object does not accelerate, so that there are actually two applied forces of magnitude FF acting in opposite directions. For example, the strings in Figure 5.13 are being pulled down by a force of magnitude ww and held up by the ceiling, which also exerts a force of magnitude ww. FF ww ww Example 5.3 Suspension cables are used to carry gondolas at ski resorts. (See Figure 5.14) Consider a suspension cable that includes an unsupported span of 3020 m. Calculate the amount of stretch in the steel cable. Assume that the cable has a diameter of 5.6 cm and the maximum tension it can withstand is 3.0×106 N3.0×106 N. 3.0×106 N3.0×106 N Figure 5.14 Gondolas travel along suspension cables at the Gala Yuzawa ski resort in Japan. (credit: Rudy Herman, Flickr) The force is equal to the maximum tension, or F=3.0×106 NF=3.0×106 N. The cross-sectional area is πr2=2.46×10−3 m2πr2=2.46×10−3 m2. The equation ΔL=1YFAL0ΔL=1YFAL0 can be used to find the change in length. F=3.0×106 NF=3.0×106 N πr2=2.46×10−3 m2πr2=2.46×10−3 m2 ΔL=1YFAL0ΔL=1YFAL0 All quantities are known. Thus, 5.31 This is quite a stretch, but only about 0.6% of the unsupported length. Effects of temperature upon length might be important in these environments. Bones, on the whole, do not fracture due to tension or compression. Rather they generally fracture due to sideways impact or bending, resulting in the bone shearing or snapping. The behavior of bones under tension and compression is important because it determines the load the bones can carry. Bones are classified as weight-bearing structures such as columns in buildings and trees. Weight-bearing structures have special features; columns in building have steel-reinforcing rods while trees and bones are fibrous. The bones in different parts of the body serve different structural functions and are prone to different stresses. Thus the bone in the top of the femur is arranged in thin sheets separated by marrow while in other places the bones can be cylindrical and filled with marrow or just solid. Overweight people have a tendency toward bone damage due to sustained compressions in bone joints and tendons. Another biological example of Hooke’s law occurs in tendons. Functionally, the tendon (the tissue connecting muscle to bone) must stretch easily at first when a force is applied, but offer a much greater restoring force for a greater strain. Figure 5.15 shows a stress-strain relationship for a human tendon. Some tendons have a high collagen content so there is relatively little strain, or length change; others, like support tendons (as in the leg) can change length up to 10%. Note that this stress-strain curve is nonlinear, since the slope of the line changes in different regions. In the first part of the stretch called the toe region, the fibers in the tendon begin to align in the direction of the stress—this is called uncrimping. In the linear region, the fibrils will be stretched, and in the failure region individual fibers begin to break. A simple model of this relationship can be illustrated by springs in parallel: different springs are activated at different lengths of stretch. Examples of this are given in the problems at end of this chapter. Ligaments (tissue connecting bone to bone) behave in a similar way. Figure 5.15 Typical stress-strain curve for mammalian tendon. Three regions are shown: (1) toe region (2) linear region, and (3) failure region. Unlike bones and tendons, which need to be strong as well as elastic, the arteries and lungs need to be very stretchable. The elastic properties of the arteries are essential for blood flow. The pressure in the arteries increases and arterial walls stretch when the blood is pumped out of the heart. When the aortic valve shuts, the pressure in the arteries drops and the arterial walls relax to maintain the blood flow. When you feel your pulse, you are feeling exactly this—the elastic behavior of the arteries as the blood gushes through with each pump of the heart. If the arteries were rigid, you would not feel a pulse. The heart is also an organ with special elastic properties. The lungs expand with muscular effort when we breathe in but relax freely and elastically when we breathe out. Our skins are particularly elastic, especially for the young. A young person can go from 100 kg to 60 kg with no visible sag in their skins. The elasticity of all organs reduces with age. Gradual physiological aging through reduction in elasticity starts in the early 20s. Example 5.4 Calculate the change in length of the upper leg bone (the femur) when a 70.0 kg man supports 62.0 kg of his mass on it, assuming the bone to be equivalent to a uniform rod that is 40.0 cm long and 2.00 cm in radius. The force is equal to the weight supported, or 5.32 and the cross-sectional area is πr2=1.257×10−3m2πr2=1.257×10−3m2. The equation  ΔL=1YFAL0ΔL=1YFAL0 can be used to find the change in length. πr2=1.257×10−3m2πr2=1.257×10−3m2 ΔL=1YFAL0ΔL=1YFAL0 All quantities except ΔLΔL are known. Note that the compression value for Young’s modulus for bone must be used here. Thus, ΔLΔL 5.33 This small change in length seems reasonable, consistent with our experience that bones are rigid. In fact, even the rather large forces encountered during strenuous physical activity do not compress or bend bones by large amounts. Although bone is rigid compared with fat or muscle, several of the substances listed in Table 5.3 have larger values of Young’s modulus YY. In other words, they are more rigid. YY The equation for change in length is traditionally rearranged and written in the following form: 5.34 The ratio of force to area, FAFA, is defined as stress (measured in

If we again rearrange this equation to the form 5.36 we see that it is the same as Hooke’s law with a proportionality constant 5.37 This general idea—that force and the deformation it causes are proportional for small deformations—applies to changes in length, sideways bending, and changes in volume.

Page 48,"Figure 5.16 illustrates what is meant by a sideways stress or a shearing force. Here the deformation is called ΔxΔx and it is perpendicular to L0L0, rather than parallel as with tension and compression. Shear deformation behaves similarly to tension and compression and can be described with similar equations. The expression for shear deformation is ΔxΔx L0L0 shear deformation 5.39 where SS is the shear modulus (see Table 5.3) and FF is the force applied perpendicular to L0L0 and parallel to the cross-sectional area AA. Again, to keep the object from accelerating, there are actually two equal and opposite forces FF applied across opposite faces, as illustrated in Figure 5.16. The equation is logical—for example, it is easier to bend a long thin pencil (small AA) than a short thick one, and both are more easily bent than similar steel rods (large SS).

Δx. Vertical forces are not shown, but it should be kept in mind that in addition to the two shearing forces, FF, there must be supporting forces to keep the object from rotating. The distorting effects of these supporting forces are ignored in this treatment. The weight of the object also is not shown, since it is usually negligible compared with forces large enough to cause significant deformations. Examination of the shear moduli in Table 5.3 reveals some telling patterns. For example, shear moduli are less than Young’s moduli for most materials. Bone is a remarkable exception. Its shear modulus is not only greater than its Young’s modulus, but it is as large as that of steel. This is why bones are so rigid. The spinal column (consisting of 26 vertebral segments separated by discs) provides the main support for the head and upper part of the body. The spinal column has normal curvature for stability, but this curvature can be increased, leading to increased shearing forces on the lower vertebrae. Discs are better at withstanding compressional forces than shear forces. Because the spine is not vertical, the weight of the upper body exerts some of both. Pregnant women and people that are overweight (with large abdomens) need to move their shoulders back to maintain balance, thereby increasing the curvature in their spine and so increasing the shear component of the stress. An increased angle due to more curvature increases the shear forces along the plane. These higher shear forces increase the risk of back injury through ruptured discs. The lumbosacral disc (the wedge shaped disc below the last vertebrae) is particularly at risk because of its location. The shear moduli for concrete and brick are very small; they are too highly variable to be listed. Concrete used in buildings can withstand compression, as in pillars and arches, but is very poor against shear, as might be encountered in heavily loaded floors or during earthquakes. Modern structures were made possible by the use of steel and steel-reinforced concrete. Almost by definition, liquids and gases have shear moduli near zero, because they flow in response to shearing forces.

Page 48,"An object will be compressed in all directions if inward forces are applied evenly on all its surfaces as in Figure 5.18. It is relatively easy to compress gases and extremely difficult to compress liquids and solids. For example, air in a wine bottle is compressed when it is corked. But if you try corking a brim-full bottle, you cannot compress the wine—some must be removed if the cork is to be inserted. The reason for these different compressibilities is that atoms and molecules are separated by large empty spaces in gases but packed close together in liquids and solids. To compress a gas, you must force its atoms and molecules closer together. To compress liquids and solids, you must actually compress their atoms and molecules, and very strong electromagnetic forces in them oppose this compression. Figure 5.18 An inward force on all surfaces compresses this cube. Its change in volume is proportional to the force per unit area and its original volume, and is related to the compressibility of the substance. We can describe the compression or volume deformation of an object with an equation. First, we note that a force “applied evenly” is defined to have the same stress, or ratio of force to area FAFA on all surfaces. The deformation produced is a change in volume ΔVΔV, which is found to behave very similarly to the shear, tension, and compression previously discussed. (This is not surprising, since a compression of the entire object is equivalent to compressing each of its three dimensions.) The relationship of the change in volume to other physical quantities is given by FAFA ΔVΔV 5.45 where 
B
B is the bulk modulus (see Table 5.3), V0V0 is the original volume, and FAFA is the force per unit area applied uniformly inward on all surfaces. Note that no bulk moduli are given for gases. B
B V0V0 FAFA What are some examples of bulk compression of solids and liquids? One practical example is the manufacture of industrial-grade diamonds by compressing carbon with an extremely large force per unit area. The carbon atoms rearrange their crystalline structure into the more tightly packed pattern of diamonds. In nature, a similar process occurs deep underground, where extremely large forces result from the weight of overlying material. Another natural source of large compressive forces is the pressure created by the weight of water, especially in deep parts of the oceans. Water exerts an inward force on all surfaces of a submerged object, and even on the water itself. At great depths, water is measurably compressed, as the following example illustrates. Example 5.6 Calculate the fractional decrease in volume (ΔVV0ΔVV0) for seawater at 5.00 km depth, where the force per unit area is

B 5.47 Although measurable, this is not a significant decrease in volume considering that the force per unit area is about 500 atmospheres (1 million pounds per square foot). Liquids and solids are extraordinarily difficult to compress. Conversely, very large forces are created by liquids and solids when they try to expand but are constrained from doing so—which is equivalent to compressing them to less than their normal volume. This often occurs when a contained material warms up, since most materials expand when their temperature increases. If the materials are tightly constrained, they deform or break their container. Another very common example occurs when water freezes. Water, unlike most materials, expands when it freezes, and it can easily fracture a boulder, rupture a biological cell, or crack an engine block that gets in its way. Other types of deformations, such as torsion or twisting, behave analogously to the tension, shear, and bulk deformations considered here."

The pits along a line from the center to the edge all move through the same angle ΔθΔθ in a time ΔtΔt. Figure 6.3 The radius of a circle is rotated through an angle ΔθΔθ. The arc length ΔsΔs is described on the circumference. The arc lengthΔsΔs is the distance traveled along a circular path as shown in Figure 6.3 Note that rr is the radius of curvature of the circular path. arc length ΔsΔs rr radius of curvature We know that for one complete revolution, the arc length is the circumference of a circle of radius rr. The circumference of a circle is 2πr2πr. Thus for one complete revolution the rotation angle is rr 2πr2πr 6.2 This result is the basis for defining the units used to measure rotation angles, ΔθΔθ to be radians (rad), defined so that ΔθΔθ radians 6.3 A comparison of some useful angles expressed in both degrees and radians is shown in Table 6.1. Table 6.1 Comparison of Angular Units Figure 6.4 Points 1 and 2 rotate through the same angle (ΔθΔθ), but point 2 moves through a greater arc length ΔsΔs because it is at a greater distance from the center of rotation (r)(r). If Δθ=2πΔθ=2π rad, then the CD has made one complete revolution, and every point on the CD is back at its original position. Because there are 360º360º in a circle or one revolution, the relationship between radians and degrees is thus Δθ=2πΔθ=2π 360º360º 6.4 so that 6.5"

The units for angular velocity are radians per second (rad/s). ΔθΔθ ΔtΔt Angular velocity ωω is analogous to linear velocity vv. To get the precise relationship between angular and linear velocity, we again consider a pit on the rotating CD.

θ vv 6.8 We write this relationship in two different ways and gain two different insights: 6.9 The first relationship in v=rω or ω=vrv=rω or ω=vr states that the linear velocity vv is proportional to the distance from the center of rotation, thus, it is largest for a point on the rim (largest rr), as you might expect. We can also call this linear speed vv of a point on the rim the tangential speed. The second relationship in v=rω or ω=vrv=rω or ω=vr can be illustrated by considering the tire of a moving car. Note that the speed of a point on the rim of the tire is the same as the speed vv of the car. See Figure 6.5. So the faster the car moves, the faster the tire spins—large vv means a large ωω, because v=rωv=rω. Similarly, a larger-radius tire rotating at the same angular velocity (ωω) will produce a greater linear speed (vv) for the car. v=rω or ω=vrv=rω or ω=vr vv rr vv v=rω or ω=vrv=rω or ω=vr vv vv ωω v=rωv=rω ωω vv Figure 6.5 A car moving at a velocity vv to the right has a tire rotating with an angular velocity ωω.The speed of the tread of the tire relative to the axle is vv, the same as if the car were jacked up. Thus the car moves forward at linear velocity v=rωv=rω, where rr is the tire radius. A larger angular velocity for the tire means a greater velocity for the car. Example 6.1 Calculate the angular velocity of a 0.300 m radius car tire when the car travels at 15.0m/s15.0m/s (about 54km/h54km/h).

Also note that if an earth mover with much larger tires, say 1.20 m in radius, were moving at the same speed of 15.0 m/s, its tires would rotate more slowly. They would have an angular velocity 6.12 Both ωω and vv have directions (hence they are angular and linear velocities, respectively). Angular velocity has only two directions with respect to the axis of rotation—it is either clockwise or counterclockwise. Linear velocity is tangent to the path, as illustrated in Figure 6.6. ωω vv Take-Home Experiment Tie an object to the end of a string and swing it around in a horizontal circle above your head (swing at your wrist). Maintain uniform speed as the object swings and measure the angular velocity of the motion. What is the approximate speed of the object? Identify a point close to your hand and take appropriate measurements to calculate the linear speed at this point. Identify other circular motions and measure their angular velocities. Figure 6.6 As an object moves in a circle, here a fly on the edge of an old-fashioned vinyl record, its instantaneous velocity is always tangent to the circle. The direction of the angular velocity is clockwise in this case."

Friction is to the left, keeping the car from slipping, and because it is the only horizontal force acting on the car, the friction is the centripetal force in this case. We know that the maximum static friction (at which the tires roll but do not slip) is μsNμsN, where μsμs is the static coefficient of friction and N is the normal force. The normal force equals the car’s weight on level ground, so that

The car will still negotiate the curve if the coefficient is greater than 0.13, because static friction is a responsive force, being able to assume a value less than but no more than μsNμsN. A higher coefficient would also allow the car to negotiate the curve at a higher speed, but if the coefficient of friction is less, the safe speed would be less than 25 m/s. Note that mass cancels, implying that in this example, it does not matter how heavily loaded the car is to negotiate the turn. Mass cancels because friction is assumed proportional to the normal force, which in turn is proportional to mass.

Page 58,"Ocean tides are one very observable result of the Moon’s gravity acting on Earth. Figure 6.21 is a simplified drawing of the Moon’s position relative to the tides. Because water easily flows on Earth’s surface, a high tide is created on the side of Earth nearest to the Moon, where the Moon’s gravitational pull is strongest. Why is there also a high tide on the opposite side of Earth? The answer is that Earth is pulled toward the Moon more than the water on the far side, because Earth is closer to the Moon. So the water on the side of Earth closest to the Moon is pulled away from Earth, and Earth is pulled away from water on the far side. As Earth rotates, the tidal bulge (an effect of the tidal forces between an orbiting natural satellite and the primary planet that it orbits) keeps its orientation with the Moon. Thus there are two tides per day (the actual tidal period is about 12 hours and 25.2 minutes), because the Moon moves in its orbit each day as well). Figure 6.21 The Moon causes ocean tides by attracting the water on the near side more than Earth, and by attracting Earth more than the water on the far side. The distances and sizes are not to scale. For this simplified representation of the Earth-Moon system, there are two high and two low tides per day at any location, because Earth rotates under the tidal bulge. The Sun also affects tides, although it has about half the effect of the Moon. However, the largest tides, called spring tides, occur when Earth, the Moon, and the Sun are aligned. The smallest tides, called neap tides, occur when the Sun is at a 90º90º angle to the Earth-Moon alignment. 90º90º Figure 6.22 (a, b) Spring tides: The highest tides occur when Earth, the Moon, and the Sun are aligned. (c) Neap tide: The lowest tides occur when the Sun lies at 90º90º to the Earth-Moon alignment. Note that this figure is not drawn to scale. Tides are not unique to Earth but occur in many astronomical systems. The most extreme tides occur where the gravitational force is the strongest and varies most rapidly, such as near black holes (see Figure 6.23). A few likely candidates for black holes have been observed in our galaxy. These have masses greater than the Sun but have diameters only a few kilometers across. The tidal forces near them are so great that they can actually tear matter from a companion star. Figure 6.23 A black hole is an object with such strong gravity that not even light can escape it. This black hole was created by the supernova of one star in a two-star system. The tidal forces created by the black hole are so great that it tears matter from the companion star. This matter is compressed and heated as it is sucked into the black hole, creating light and X-rays observable from Earth."
Page 58,"In contrast to the tremendous gravitational force near black holes is the apparent gravitational field experienced by astronauts orbiting Earth. What is the effect of “weightlessness” upon an astronaut who is in orbit for months? Or what about the effect of weightlessness upon plant growth? Weightlessness doesn’t mean that an astronaut is not being acted upon by the gravitational force. There is no “zero gravity” in an astronaut’s orbit. The term just means that the astronaut is in free-fall, accelerating with the acceleration due to gravity. If an elevator cable breaks, the passengers inside will be in free fall and will experience weightlessness. You can experience short periods of weightlessness in some rides in amusement parks. Figure 6.24 Astronauts experiencing weightlessness on board the International Space Station. (credit: NASA) Microgravity refers to an environment in which the apparent net acceleration of a body is small compared with that produced by Earth at its surface. Many interesting biology and physics topics have been studied over the past three decades in the presence of microgravity. Of immediate concern is the effect on astronauts of extended times in outer space, such as at the International Space Station. Researchers have observed that muscles will atrophy (waste away) in this environment. There is also a corresponding loss of bone mass. Study continues on cardiovascular adaptation to space flight. On Earth, blood pressure is usually higher in the feet than in the head, because the higher column of blood exerts a downward force on it, due to gravity. When standing, 70% of your blood is below the level of the heart, while in a horizontal position, just the opposite occurs. What difference does the absence of this pressure differential have upon the heart? Microgravity Some findings in human physiology in space can be clinically important to the management of diseases back on Earth. On a somewhat negative note, spaceflight is known to affect the human immune system, possibly making the crew members more vulnerable to infectious diseases. Experiments flown in space also have shown that some bacteria grow faster in microgravity than they do on Earth. However, on a positive note, studies indicate that microbial antibiotic production can increase by a factor of two in space-grown cultures. One hopes to be able to understand these mechanisms so that similar successes can be achieved on the ground. In another area of physics space research, inorganic crystals and protein crystals have been grown in outer space that have much higher quality than any grown on Earth, so crystallography studies on their structure can yield much better results. Plants have evolved with the stimulus of gravity and with gravity sensors. Roots grow downward and shoots grow upward. Plants might be able to provide a life support system for long duration space missions by regenerating the atmosphere, purifying water, and producing food. Some studies have indicated that plant growth and development are not affected by gravity, but there is still uncertainty about structural changes in plants grown in a microgravity environment."
Page 58,"As previously noted, the universal gravitational constant GG is determined experimentally. This definition was first done accurately by Henry Cavendish (1731–1810), an English scientist, in 1798, more than 100 years after Newton published his universal law of gravitation. The measurement of GG is very basic and important because it determines the strength of one of the four forces in nature. Cavendish’s experiment was very difficult because he measured the tiny gravitational attraction between two ordinary-sized masses (tens of kilograms at most), using apparatus like that in Figure 6.25. Remarkably, his value for GG differs by less than 1% from the best modern value. GG GG GG One important consequence of knowing GG was that an accurate value for Earth’s mass could finally be obtained. This was done by measuring the acceleration due to gravity as accurately as possible and then calculating the mass of Earth MM from the relationship Newton’s universal law of gravitation gives GG MM 6.52 where mm is the mass of the object, MM is the mass of Earth, and rr is the distance to the center of Earth (the distance between the centers of mass of the object and Earth). See Figure 6.18. The mass mm of the object cancels, leaving an equation for gg: mm MM rr mm gg 6.53 Rearranging to solve for MM yields MM 6.54 So MM can be calculated because all quantities on the right, including the radius of Earth rr, are known from direct measurements. We shall see in Satellites and Kepler's Laws: An Argument for Simplicity that knowing GG also allows for the determination of astronomical masses. Interestingly, of all the fundamental constants in physics, GG is by far the least well determined. MM rr GG GG The Cavendish experiment is also used to explore other aspects of gravity. One of the most interesting questions is whether the gravitational force depends on substance as well as mass—for example, whether one kilogram of lead exerts the same gravitational pull as one kilogram of water. A Hungarian scientist named Roland von Eötvös pioneered this inquiry early in the 20th century. He found, with an accuracy of five parts per billion, that the gravitational force does not depend on the substance. Such experiments continue today, and have improved upon Eötvös’ measurements. Cavendish-type experiments such as those of Eric Adelberger and others at the University of Washington, have also put severe limits on the possibility of a fifth force and have verified a major prediction of general relativity—that gravitational energy contributes to rest mass. Ongoing measurements there use a torsion balance and a parallel plate (not spheres, as Cavendish used) to examine how Newton’s law of gravitation works over sub-millimeter distances. On this small-scale, do gravitational effects depart from the inverse square law? So far, no deviation has been observed. Figure 6.25 Cavendish used an apparatus like this to measure the gravitational attraction between the two suspended spheres (mm) and the two on the stand (MM) by observing the amount of torsion (twisting) created in the fiber. Distance between the masses can be varied to check the dependence of the force on distance. Modern experiments of this type continue to explore gravity."

Page 59,"Kepler’s First Law The orbit of each planet about the Sun is an ellipse with the Sun at one focus. Figure 6.26 (a) An ellipse is a closed curve such that the sum of the distances from a point on the curve to the two foci (f1f1 and f2f2) is a constant. You can draw an ellipse as shown by putting a pin at each focus, and then placing a string around a pencil and the pins and tracing a line on paper. A circle is a special case of an ellipse in which the two foci coincide (thus any point on the circle is the same distance from the center). (b) For any closed gravitational orbit, mm follows an elliptical path with MM at one focus. Kepler’s first law states this fact for planets orbiting the Sun. Kepler’s Second Law Each planet moves so that an imaginary line drawn from the Sun to the planet sweeps out equal areas in equal times (see Figure 6.27). Kepler’s Third Law The ratio of the squares of the periods of any two planets about the Sun is equal to the ratio of the cubes of their average distances from the Sun. In equation form, this is 6.55 where TT is the period (time for one orbit) and rr is the average radius. This equation is valid only for comparing two small masses orbiting the same large one. Most importantly, this is a descriptive equation only, giving no information as to the cause of the equality. TT rr Figure 6.27 The shaded regions have equal areas. It takes equal times for mm to go from A to B, from C to D, and from E to F. The mass mm moves fastest when it is closest to MM. Kepler’s second law was originally devised for planets orbiting the Sun, but it has broader validity. Note again that while, for historical reasons, Kepler’s laws are stated for planets orbiting the Sun, they are actually valid for all bodies satisfying the two previously stated conditions.

Page 59,"We shall derive Kepler’s third law, starting with Newton’s laws of motion and his universal law of gravitation. The point is to demonstrate that the force of gravity is the cause for Kepler’s laws (although we will only derive the third one). Let us consider a circular orbit of a small mass mm around a large mass MM, satisfying the two conditions stated at the beginning of this section. Gravity supplies the centripetal force to mass mm. Starting with Newton’s second law applied to circular motion, mm MM mm 6.60 The net external force on mass mm is gravity, and so we substitute the force of gravity for FnetFnet: mm FnetFnet 6.61 The mass mm cancels, yielding mm 6.62 The fact that mm cancels out is another aspect of the oft-noted fact that at a given location all masses fall with the same acceleration. Here we see that at a given orbital radius rr, all masses orbit at the same speed. (This was implied by the result of the preceding worked example.) Now, to get at Kepler’s third law, we must get the period TT into the equation. By definition, period TT is the time for one complete orbit. Now the average speed vv is the circumference divided by the period—that is, mm rr TT TT vv 6.63 Substituting this into the previous equation gives 6.64 Solving for T2T2 yields T2T2 6.65 Using subscripts 1 and 2 to denote two different satellites, and taking the ratio of the last equation for satellite 1 to satellite 2 yields 6.66 This is Kepler’s third law. Note that Kepler’s third law is valid only for comparing satellites of the same parent body, because only then does the mass of the parent body MM cancel. MM Now consider what we get if we solve T2=4π2GMr3T2=4π2GMr3 for the ratio r3/T2r3/T2. We obtain a relationship that can be used to determine the mass MM of a parent body from the orbits of its satellites: T2=4π2GMr3T2=4π2GMr3 r3/T2r3/T2 MM 6.67 If rr and TT are known for a satellite, then the mass MM of the parent can be calculated. This principle has been used extensively to find the masses of heavenly bodies that have satellites. Furthermore, the ratio r3/T2r3/T2 should be a constant for all satellites of the same parent body (because r3/T2=GM/4π2r3/T2=GM/4π2). (See Table 6.2). rr TT MM r3/T2r3/T2 r3/T2=GM/4π2r3/T2=GM/4π2 It is clear from Table 6.2 that the ratio of r3/T2r3/T2 is constant, at least to the third digit, for all listed satellites of the Sun, and for those of Jupiter. Small variations in that ratio have two causes—uncertainties in the rr and TT data, and perturbations of the orbits due to other bodies. Interestingly, those perturbations can be—and have been—used to predict the location of new planets and moons. This is another verification of Newton’s universal law of gravitation. r3/T2r3/T2 rr TT Making Connections Newton’s universal law of gravitation is modified by Einstein’s general theory of relativity, as we shall see in Particle Physics. Newton’s gravity is not seriously in error—it was and still is an extremely good approximation for most situations. Einstein’s modification is most noticeable in extremely large gravitational fields, such as near black holes. However, general relativity also explains such phenomena as small but long-known deviations of the orbit of the planet Mercury from classical predictions."
Page 59,"The development of the universal law of gravitation by Newton played a pivotal role in the history of ideas. While it is beyond the scope of this text to cover that history in any detail, we note some important points. The definition of planet set in 2006 by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) states that in the solar system, a planet is a celestial body that: A non-satellite body fulfilling only the first two of the above criteria is classified as “dwarf planet.” In 2006, Pluto was demoted to a ‘dwarf planet’ after scientists revised their definition of what constitutes a “true” planet. Table 6.2 Orbital Data and Kepler’s Third Law The universal law of gravitation is a good example of a physical principle that is very broadly applicable. That single equation for the gravitational force describes all situations in which gravity acts. It gives a cause for a vast number of effects, such as the orbits of the planets and moons in the solar system. It epitomizes the underlying unity and simplicity of physics. Before the discoveries of Kepler, Copernicus, Galileo, Newton, and others, the solar system was thought to revolve around Earth as shown in Figure 6.28(a). This is called the Ptolemaic view, for the Greek philosopher who lived in the second century AD. This model is characterized by a list of facts for the motions of planets with no cause and effect explanation. There tended to be a different rule for each heavenly body and a general lack of simplicity. Figure 6.28(b) represents the modern or Copernican model. In this model, a small set of rules and a single underlying force explain not only all motions in the solar system, but all other situations involving gravity. The breadth and simplicity of the laws of physics are compelling. As our knowledge of nature has grown, the basic simplicity of its laws has become ever more evident. Figure 6.28 (a) The Ptolemaic model of the universe has Earth at the center with the Moon, the planets, the Sun, and the stars revolving about it in complex superpositions of circular paths. This geocentric model, which can be made progressively more accurate by adding more circles, is purely descriptive, containing no hints as to what are the causes of these motions. (b) The Copernican model has the Sun at the center of the solar system. It is fully explained by a small number of laws of physics, including Newton’s universal law of gravitation."

Race car drivers will take the inside path (called cutting the corner) whenever possible because it allows them to take the curve at the highest speed. 7 . A number of amusement parks have rides that make vertical loops like the one shown in Figure 6.30. For safety, the cars are attached to the rails in such a way that they cannot fall off.

Assuming no initial rotation and a flow initially directly straight toward the drain, explain what causes the rotation and which direction it has in the northern hemisphere.

Part of riding a bicycle involves leaning at the correct angle when making a turn, as seen in Figure 6.33. To be stable, the force exerted by the ground must be on a line going through the center of gravity.

The force of the ground on the wheel needs to be on a line through the center of gravity. The net external force on the system is the centripetal force. The vertical component of the force on the wheel cancels the weight of the system while its horizontal component must supply the centripetal force.

Modern roller coasters have vertical loops like the one shown in Figure 6.35. The radius of curvature is smaller at the top than on the sides so that the downward centripetal acceleration at the top will be greater than the acceleration due to gravity, keeping the passengers pressed firmly into their seats.

Figure 6.35 Teardrop-shaped loops are used in the latest roller coasters so that the radius of curvature gradually decreases to a minimum at the top. This means that the centripetal acceleration builds from zero to a maximum at the top and gradually decreases again.

The existence of the dwarf planet Pluto was proposed based on irregularities in Neptune’s orbit. Pluto was subsequently discovered near its predicted position.

Page 65,"The scientific definition of work differs in some ways from its everyday meaning. Certain things we think of as hard work, such as writing an exam or carrying a heavy load on level ground, are not work as defined by a scientist. The scientific definition of work reveals its relationship to energy—whenever work is done, energy is transferred. For work, in the scientific sense, to be done, a force must be exerted and there must be displacement in the direction of the force. Formally, the work done on a system by a constant force is defined to be the product of the component of the force in the direction of motion times the distance through which the force acts. For one-way motion in one dimension, this is expressed in equation form as work 7.1 where WW is work, dd is the displacement of the system, and θθ is the angle between the force vector FF and the displacement vector dd, as in Figure 7.2. We can also write this as WW dd θθ FF dd 7.2 To find the work done on a system that undergoes motion that is not one-way or that is in two or three dimensions, we divide the motion into one-way one-dimensional segments and add up the work done over each segment. What is Work? The work done on a system by a constant force is the product of the component of the force in the direction of motion times the distance through which the force acts. For one-way motion in one dimension, this is expressed in equation form as 7.3 where WW is work, FF is the magnitude of the force on the system, dd is the magnitude of the displacement of the system, and θθ is the angle between the force vector FF and the displacement vector dd. WW FF dd θθ FF dd Figure 7.2 Examples of work. (a) The work done by the force FF on this lawn mower is FdcosθFdcosθ. Note that FcosθFcosθ is the component of the force in the direction of motion. (b) A person holding a briefcase does no work on it, because there is no displacement. No energy is transferred to or from the briefcase. (c) The person moving the briefcase horizontally at a constant speed does no work on it, and transfers no energy to it. (d) Work is done on the briefcase by carrying it up stairs at constant speed, because there is necessarily a component of force FF in the direction of the motion. Energy is transferred to the briefcase and could in turn be used to do work. (e) When the briefcase is lowered, energy is transferred out of the briefcase and into an electric generator. Here the work done on the briefcase by the generator is negative, removing energy from the briefcase, because FF and dd are in opposite directions. To examine what the definition of work means, let us consider the other situations shown in Figure 7.2. The person holding the briefcase in Figure 7.2(b) does no work, for example. Here d=0d=0, so W=0W=0. Why is it you get tired just holding a load? The answer is that your muscles are doing work against one another, but they are doing no work on the system of interest (the “briefcase-Earth system”—see Gravitational Potential Energy for more details). There must be displacement for work to be done, and there must be a component of the force in the direction of the motion. For example, the person carrying the briefcase on level ground in Figure 7.2(c) does no work on it, because the force is perpendicular to the motion. That is, cos90º =0cos90º =0, and so W=0W=0. d=0d=0 W=0W=0 cos90º =0cos90º =0 W=0W=0 In contrast, when a force exerted on the system has a component in the direction of motion, such as in Figure 7.2(d), work is done—energy is transferred to the briefcase. Finally, in Figure 7.2(e), energy is transferred from the briefcase to a generator. There are two good ways to interpret this energy transfer. One interpretation is that the briefcase’s weight does work on the generator, giving it energy. The other interpretation is that the generator does negative work on the briefcase, thus removing energy from it. The drawing shows the latter, with the force from the generator upward on the briefcase, and the displacement downward. This makes θ=180ºθ=180º, and cos 180º=–1cos 180º=–1; therefore, WW is negative. θ=180ºθ=180º cos 180º=–1cos 180º=–1 WW"

Page 65,"Work and energy have the same units. From the definition of work, we see that those units are force times distance. Thus, in SI units, work and energy are measured in newton-meters. A newton-meter is given the special name joule (J), and 1 J=1 N⋅m=1 kg⋅m2/s21 J=1 N⋅m=1 kg⋅m2/s2. One joule is not a large amount of energy; it would lift a small 100-gram apple a distance of about 1 meter. newton-meters joule 1 J=1 N⋅m=1 kg⋅m2/s21 J=1 N⋅m=1 kg⋅m2/s2 Example 7.1 How much work is done on the lawn mower by the person in Figure 7.2(a) if he exerts a constant force of 75.0N75.0N at an angle 35º35º below the horizontal and pushes the mower 25.0m25.0m on level ground? Convert the amount of work from joules to kilocalories and compare it with this person’s average daily intake of 10,000kJ10,000kJ (about 2400kcal2400kcal) of food energy. One calorie (1 cal) of heat is the amount required to warm 1 g of water by 1ºC1ºC, and is equivalent to 4.186J4.186J, while one food calorie (1 kcal) is equivalent to 4186J4186J. 75.0N75.0N 35º35º 25.0m25.0m 10,000kJ10,000kJ 2400kcal2400kcal 1ºC1ºC 4.186J4.186J 4186J4186J We can solve this problem by substituting the given values into the definition of work done on a system, stated in the equation W=FdcosθW=Fdcosθ.

The ratio of the work done to the daily consumption is W=(1536J)(1kcal/4186J)=0.367kcalW=(1536J)(1kcal/4186J)=0.367kcal 7.6 This ratio is a tiny fraction of what the person consumes, but it is typical. Very little of the energy released in the consumption of food is used to do work. Even when we “work” all day long, less than 10% of our food energy intake is used to do work and more than 90% is converted to thermal energy or stored as chemical energy in fat."

Page 66,"What happens to the work done on a system? Energy is transferred into the system, but in what form? Does it remain in the system or move on? The answers depend on the situation. For example, if the lawn mower in Figure 7.2(a) is pushed just hard enough to keep it going at a constant speed, then energy put into the mower by the person is removed continuously by friction, and eventually leaves the system in the form of heat transfer. In contrast, work done on the briefcase by the person carrying it up stairs in Figure 7.2(d) is stored in the briefcase-Earth system and can be recovered at any time, as shown in Figure 7.2(e). In fact, the building of the pyramids in ancient Egypt is an example of storing energy in a system by doing work on the system. Some of the energy imparted to the stone blocks in lifting them during construction of the pyramids remains in the stone-Earth system and has the potential to do work. In this section we begin the study of various types of work and forms of energy. We will find that some types of work leave the energy of a system constant, for example, whereas others change the system in some way, such as making it move. We will also develop definitions of important forms of energy, such as the energy of motion."
Page 66,"We know from the study of Newton’s laws in Dynamics: Force and Newton's Laws of Motion that net force causes acceleration. We will see in this section that work done by the net force gives a system energy of motion, and in the process we will also find an expression for the energy of motion. Let us start by considering the total, or net, work done on a system. Net work is defined to be the sum of work on an object. The net work can be written in terms of the net force on an object. FnetFnet. In equation form, this is Wnet=FnetdcosθWnet=Fnetdcosθ where θθ is the angle between the force vector and the displacement vector. FnetFnet Wnet=FnetdcosθWnet=Fnetdcosθ θθ Figure 7.3(a) shows a graph of force versus displacement for the component of the force in the direction of the displacement—that is, an FcosθFcosθ vs. dd graph. In this case, FcosθFcosθ is constant. You can see that the area under the graph is FdcosθFdcosθ, or the work done. Figure 7.3(b) shows a more general process where the force varies. The area under the curve is divided into strips, each having an average force (Fcosθ)i(ave)(Fcosθ)i(ave). The work done is (Fcosθ)i(ave)di(Fcosθ)i(ave)di for each strip, and the total work done is the sum of the WiWi. Thus the total work done is the total area under the curve, a useful property to which we shall refer later.

The area under the curve represents the work done by the force. (b) A graph of FcosθFcosθ vs. dd in which the force varies. The work done for each interval is the area of each strip; thus, the total area under the curve equals the total work done. Net work will be simpler to examine if we consider a one-dimensional situation where a force is used to accelerate an object in a direction parallel to its initial velocity. Such a situation occurs for the package on the roller belt conveyor system shown in Figure 7.4. Figure 7.4 A package on a roller belt is pushed horizontally through a distance 
d
d. The force of gravity and the normal force acting on the package are perpendicular to the displacement and do no work. Moreover, they are also equal in magnitude and opposite in direction so they cancel in calculating the net force. The net force arises solely from the horizontal applied force FappFapp and the horizontal friction force ff. Thus, as expected, the net force is parallel to the displacement, so that θ=0ºθ=0º and cosθ=1cosθ=1, and the net work is given by FappFapp ff θ=0ºθ=0º cosθ=1cosθ=1 7.7 The effect of the net force FnetFnet is to accelerate the package from v0v0 to vv. The kinetic energy of the package increases, indicating that the net work done on the system is positive. (See Example 7.2.) By using Newton’s second law, and doing some algebra, we can reach an interesting conclusion. Substituting Fnet=maFnet=ma from Newton’s second law gives FnetFnet v0v0 vv Fnet=maFnet=ma 7.8 To get a relationship between net work and the speed given to a system by the net force acting on it, we take d=x−x0d=x−x0 and use the equation studied in Motion Equations for Constant Acceleration in One Dimension for the change in speed over a distance dd if the acceleration has the constant value
aa; namely,
v2=v02+2adv2=v02+2ad (note that
aa appears in the expression for the net work). Solving for acceleration gives
a=v2−v022da=v2−v022d. When
aa is substituted into the preceding expression for
WnetWnet, we obtain d=x−x0d=x−x0 dd aa v2=v02+2adv2=v02+2ad aa a=v2−v022da=v2−v022d aa WnetWnet 7.9 The dd cancels, and we rearrange this to obtain dd 7.10 This expression is called the work-energy theorem, and it actually applies in general (even for forces that vary in direction and magnitude), although we have derived it for the special case of a constant force parallel to the displacement. The theorem implies that the net work on a system equals the change in the quantity 12mv212mv2. This quantity is our first example of a form of energy. work-energy theorem 12mv212mv2 The Work-Energy Theorem The net work on a system equals the change in the quantity 12mv212mv2. 12mv212mv2 7.11 The quantity 12mv212mv2 in the work-energy theorem is defined to be the translational kinetic energy (KE) of a mass mm moving at a speed vv. (Translational kinetic energy is distinct from rotational kinetic energy, which is considered later.) In equation form, the translational kinetic energy, 12mv212mv2 kinetic energy mm vv 7.12 is the energy associated with translational motion. Kinetic energy is a form of energy associated with the motion of a particle, single body, or system of objects moving together. We are aware that it takes energy to get an object, like a car or the package in Figure 7.4, up to speed, but it may be a bit surprising that kinetic energy is proportional to speed squared. This proportionality means, for example, that a car traveling at 100 km/h has four times the kinetic energy it has at 50 km/h, helping to explain why high-speed collisions are so devastating. We will now consider a series of examples to illustrate various aspects of work and energy."

Page 67,"Climbing stairs and lifting objects is work in both the scientific and everyday sense—it is work done against the gravitational force. When there is work, there is a transformation of energy. The work done against the gravitational force goes into an important form of stored energy that we will explore in this section. Let us calculate the work done in lifting an object of mass mm through a height hh, such as in Figure 7.5, near Earth's surface. If the object is lifted straight up at constant speed, then the force needed to lift it is equal to its weight mgmg. The work done on the mass is then W = Fd = mghW = Fd = mgh. We define this to be the gravitational potential energy (PEg)(PEg) put into (or gained by) the object-Earth system. This energy is associated with the state of separation between two objects that attract each other by the gravitational force. For convenience, we refer to this as the PEgPEg gained by the object, recognizing that this is energy stored in the gravitational field of Earth. Why do we use the word “system”? Potential energy is a property of a system rather than of a single object—due to its physical position. An object’s gravitational potential is due to its position relative to the surroundings within the Earth-object system. The force applied to the object is an external force, from outside the system. When it does positive work it increases the gravitational potential energy of the system. Because gravitational potential energy depends on relative position, we need a reference level at which to set the potential energy equal to 0. We usually choose this point to be Earth’s surface, but this point is arbitrary; what is important is the difference in gravitational potential energy, because this difference is what relates to the work done. The difference in gravitational potential energy of an object (in the Earth-object system) between two rungs of a ladder will be the same for the first two rungs as for the last two rungs. mm hh mgmg W = Fd = mghW = Fd = mgh gravitational potential energy (PEg)(PEg) PEgPEg"
Page 67,"Gravitational potential energy may be converted to other forms of energy, such as kinetic energy. If we release the mass, gravitational force will do an amount of work equal to mghmgh on it, thereby increasing its kinetic energy by that same amount (by the work-energy theorem). We will find it more useful to consider just the conversion of PEgPEg to KEKE without explicitly considering the intermediate step of work. (See Example 7.7.) This shortcut makes it is easier to solve problems using energy (if possible) rather than explicitly using forces. mghmgh PEgPEg KEKE Figure 7.5 (a) The work done to lift the weight is stored in the mass-Earth system as gravitational potential energy. (b) As the weight moves downward, this gravitational potential energy is transferred to the cuckoo clock. More precisely, we define the change in gravitational potential energy ΔPEgΔPEg to be ΔPEgΔPEg 7.27 where, for simplicity, we denote the change in height by hh rather than the usual ΔhΔh. Note that hh is positive when the final height is greater than the initial height, and vice versa. For example, if a 0.500-kg mass hung from a cuckoo clock is raised 1.00 m, then its change in gravitational potential energy is hh ΔhΔh hh 7.28 Note that the units of gravitational potential energy turn out to be joules, the same as for work and other forms of energy. As the clock runs, the mass is lowered. We can think of the mass as gradually giving up its 4.90 J of gravitational potential energy, without directly considering the force of gravity that does the work."
Page 67,"The equation ΔPEg=mghΔPEg=mgh applies for any path that has a change in height of hh, not just when the mass is lifted straight up, as long as hh is small compared to the radius of Earth. Note that, as we learned in Uniform Circular Motion and Gravitation, the force of Earth’s gravity does decrease with distance from Earth. The change is negligible for small changes in distance, but if you want to use potential energy in problems involving travel to the moon or even further, Newton’s universal law of gravity must be taken into account. This more complete treatment is beyond the scope of this text and is not necessary for the problems we consider here. (See Figure 7.6.) It is much easier to calculate mghmgh (a simple multiplication) than it is to calculate the work done along a complicated path. The idea of gravitational potential energy has the double advantage that it is very broadly applicable and it makes calculations easier. From now on, we will consider that any change in vertical position hh of a mass mm is accompanied by a change in gravitational potential energy mghmgh, and we will avoid the equivalent but more difficult task of calculating work done by or against the gravitational force. ΔPEg=mghΔPEg=mgh hh hh mghmgh hh mm mghmgh Figure 7.6 The change in gravitational potential energy (ΔPEg)(ΔPEg) between points A and B is independent of the path. ΔPEg=mghΔPEg=mgh for any path between the two points. Gravity is one of a small class of forces where the work done by or against the force depends only on the starting and ending points, not on the path between them. Example 7.6 A 60.0-kg person jumps onto the floor from a height of 3.00 m. If he lands stiffly (with his knee joints compressing by 0.500 cm), calculate the force on the knee joints. This person’s energy is brought to zero in this situation by the work done on him by the floor as he stops. The initial PEgPEg is transformed into KEKE as he falls. The work done by the floor reduces this kinetic energy to zero. PEgPEg KEKE The work done on the person by the floor as he stops is given by 7.29 with a minus sign because the displacement while stopping and the force from floor are in opposite directions (cosθ=cos180º=−1)(cosθ=cos180º=−1). The floor removes energy from the system, so it does negative work. (cosθ=cos180º=−1)(cosθ=cos180º=−1) The kinetic energy the person has upon reaching the floor is the amount of potential energy lost by falling through height hh: hh 7.30 The distance dd that the person’s knees bend is much smaller than the height hh of the fall, so the additional change in gravitational potential energy during the knee bend is ignored. dd hh The work WW done by the floor on the person stops the person and brings the person’s kinetic energy to zero: WW 7.31 Combining this equation with the expression for WW gives WW 7.32 Recalling that hh is negative because the person fell down, the force on the knee joints is given by hh 7.33 Such a large force (500 times more than the person’s weight) over the short impact time is enough to break bones. A much better way to cushion the shock is by bending the legs or rolling on the ground, increasing the time over which the force acts. A bending motion of 0.5 m this way yields a force 100 times smaller than in the example. A kangaroo's hopping shows this method in action. The kangaroo is the only large animal to use hopping for locomotion, but the shock in hopping is cushioned by the bending of its hind legs in each jump.(See Figure 7.7.) Figure 7.7 The work done by the ground upon the kangaroo reduces its kinetic energy to zero as it lands. However, by applying the force of the ground on the hind legs over a longer distance, the impact on the bones is reduced. (credit: Chris Samuel, Flickr) Example 7.7 (a) What is the final speed of the roller coaster shown in Figure 7.8 if it starts from rest at the top of the 20.0 m hill and work done by frictional forces is negligible? (b) What is its final speed (again assuming negligible friction) if its initial speed is 5.00 m/s? Figure 7.8 The speed of a roller coaster increases as gravity pulls it downhill and is greatest at its lowest point. Viewed in terms of energy, the roller-coaster-Earth system’s gravitational potential energy is converted to kinetic energy. If work done by friction is negligible, all ΔPEgΔPEg is converted to KEKE. The roller coaster loses potential energy as it goes downhill. We neglect friction, so that the remaining force exerted by the track is the normal force, which is perpendicular to the direction of motion and does no work. The net work on the roller coaster is then done by gravity alone. The loss of gravitational potential energy from moving downward through a distance hh equals the gain in kinetic energy. This can be written in equation form as −ΔPEg=ΔKE−ΔPEg=ΔKE. Using the equations for PEgPEg and KEKE, we can solve for the final speed vv, which is the desired quantity. hh −ΔPEg=ΔKE−ΔPEg=ΔKE PEgPEg KEKE vv Here the initial kinetic energy is zero, so that ΔKE=12mv2ΔKE=12mv2. The equation for change in potential energy states that ΔPEg=mghΔPEg=mgh. Since hh is negative in this case, we will rewrite this as ΔPEg=−mg∣h∣ΔPEg=−mg∣h∣ to show the minus sign clearly. Thus, ΔKE=12mv2ΔKE=12mv2 ΔPEg=mghΔPEg=mgh hh ΔPEg=−mg∣h∣ΔPEg=−mg∣h∣ 7.34 becomes 7.35 Solving for vv, we find that mass cancels and that vv 7.36 Substituting known values, 7.37 Again −ΔPEg=ΔKE−ΔPEg=ΔKE.

+2ad 7.41 First, note that mass cancels. This is quite consistent with observations made in Falling Objects that all objects fall at the same rate if friction is negligible. Second, only the speed of the roller coaster is considered; there is no information about its direction at any point. This reveals another general truth. When friction is negligible, the speed of a falling body depends only on its initial speed and height, and not on its mass or the path taken. For example, the roller coaster will have the same final speed whether it falls 20.0 m straight down or takes a more complicated path like the one in the figure. Third, and perhaps unexpectedly, the final speed in part (b) is greater than in part (a), but by far less than 5.00 m/s. Finally, note that speed can be found at any height along the way by simply using the appropriate value of hh at the point of interest. hh We have seen that work done by or against the gravitational force depends only on the starting and ending points, and not on the path between, allowing us to define the simplifying concept of gravitational potential energy. We can do the same thing for a few other forces, and we will see that this leads to a formal definition of the law of conservation of energy. Making Connections: Take-Home Investigation—Converting Potential to Kinetic Energy One can study the conversion of gravitational potential energy into kinetic energy in this experiment. On a smooth, level surface, use a ruler of the kind that has a groove running along its length and a book to make an incline (see Figure 7.9). Place a marble at the 10-cm position on the ruler and let it roll down the ruler. When it hits the level surface, measure the time it takes to roll one meter. Now place the marble at the 20-cm and the 30-cm positions and again measure the times it takes to roll 1 m on the level surface. Find the velocity of the marble on the level surface for all three positions. Plot velocity squared versus the distance traveled by the marble. What is the shape of each plot? If the shape is a straight line, the plot shows that the marble’s kinetic energy at the bottom is proportional to its potential energy at the release point. Figure 7.9 A marble rolls down a ruler, and its speed on the level surface is measured."
Page 67,"A 60.0-kg person jumps onto the floor from a height of 3.00 m. If he lands stiffly (with his knee joints compressing by 0.500 cm), calculate the force on the knee joints. This person’s energy is brought to zero in this situation by the work done on him by the floor as he stops. The initial PEgPEg is transformed into KEKE as he falls. The work done by the floor reduces this kinetic energy to zero. PEgPEg KEKE The work done on the person by the floor as he stops is given by 7.29 with a minus sign because the displacement while stopping and the force from floor are in opposite directions (cosθ=cos180º=−1)(cosθ=cos180º=−1). The floor removes energy from the system, so it does negative work.

A much better way to cushion the shock is by bending the legs or rolling on the ground, increasing the time over which the force acts. A bending motion of 0.5 m this way yields a force 100 times smaller than in the example. A kangaroo's hopping shows this method in action. The kangaroo is the only large animal to use hopping for locomotion, but the shock in hopping is cushioned by the bending of its hind legs in each jump.(See Figure 7.7.)"

Page 68,"Work is done by a force, and some forces, such as weight, have special characteristics. A conservative force is one, like the gravitational force, for which work done by or against it depends only on the starting and ending points of a motion and not on the path taken. We can define a potential energy (PE)(PE) for any conservative force, just as we did for the gravitational force. For example, when you wind up a toy, an egg timer, or an old-fashioned watch, you do work against its spring and store energy in it. (We treat these springs as ideal, in that we assume there is no friction and no production of thermal energy.) This stored energy is recoverable as work, and it is useful to think of it as potential energy contained in the spring. Indeed, the reason that the spring has this characteristic is that its force is conservative. That is, a conservative force results in stored or potential energy. Gravitational potential energy is one example, as is the energy stored in a spring. We will also see how conservative forces are related to the conservation of energy. conservative force potential energy (PE)(PE) Potential Energy and Conservative Forces Potential energy is the energy a system has due to position, shape, or configuration. It is stored energy that is completely recoverable. A conservative force is one for which work done by or against it depends only on the starting and ending points of a motion and not on the path taken. We can define a potential energy (PE)(PE) for any conservative force. The work done against a conservative force to reach a final configuration depends on the configuration, not the path followed, and is the potential energy added. (PE)(PE)"

Page 68,"First, let us obtain an expression for the potential energy stored in a spring (PEsPEs). We calculate the work done to stretch or compress a spring that obeys Hooke’s law. (Hooke’s law was examined in Elasticity: Stress and Strain, and states that the magnitude of force FF on the spring and the resulting deformation ΔLΔL are proportional, F=kΔLF=kΔL.) (See Figure 7.10.) For our spring, we will replace ΔLΔL (the amount of deformation produced by a force FF) by the distance xx that the spring is stretched or compressed along its length. So the force needed to stretch the spring has magnitude F = kxF = kx, where kk is the spring’s force constant. The force increases linearly from 0 at the start to  kxkx in the fully stretched position. The average force is kx/2kx/2. Thus the work done in stretching or compressing the spring is Ws=Fd=kx2x=12kx2Ws=Fd=kx2x=12kx2. Alternatively, we noted in Kinetic Energy and the Work-Energy Theorem that the area under a graph of FF vs. xx is the work done by the force. In Figure 7.10(c) we see that this area is also 12kx212kx2. We therefore define the potential energy of a spring, PEsPEs, to be PEsPEs FF ΔLΔL F=kΔLF=kΔL ΔLΔL FF xx F = kxF = kx kk kxkx kx/2kx/2 Ws=Fd=kx2x=12kx2Ws=Fd=kx2x=12kx2 FF xx 12kx212kx2 potential energy of a spring PEsPEs 7.42 where kk is the spring’s force constant and xx is the displacement from its undeformed position. The potential energy represents the work done on the spring and the energy stored in it as a result of stretching or compressing it a distance xx. The potential energy of the spring PEsPEs does not depend on the path taken; it depends only on the stretch or squeeze xx in the final configuration. kk xx xx PEsPEs xx Figure 7.10 (a) An undeformed spring has no PEsPEs stored in it. (b) The force needed to stretch (or compress) the spring a distance xx has a magnitude F=kxF=kx , and the work done to stretch (or compress) it is 12kx212kx2. Because the force is conservative, this work is stored as potential energy (PEs)(PEs) in the spring, and it can be fully recovered. (c) A graph of FF vs. xx has a slope of kk, and the area under the graph is 12kx212kx2. Thus the work done or potential energy stored is 12kx212kx2. The equation PEs=12kx2PEs=12kx2 has general validity beyond the special case for which it was derived. Potential energy can be stored in any elastic medium by deforming it. Indeed, the general definition of potential energy is energy due to position, shape, or configuration. For shape or position deformations, stored energy is PEs=12kx2PEs=12kx2, where kk is the force constant of the particular system and xx is its deformation. Another example is seen in Figure 7.11 for a guitar string. PEs=12kx2PEs=12kx2 potential energy PEs=12kx2PEs=12kx2 kk xx Figure 7.11 Work is done to deform the guitar string, giving it potential energy. When released, the potential energy is converted to kinetic energy and back to potential as the string oscillates back and forth. A very small fraction is dissipated as sound energy, slowly removing energy from the string."
Page 68,"Let us now consider what form the work-energy theorem takes when only conservative forces are involved. This will lead us to the conservation of energy principle. The work-energy theorem states that the net work done by all forces acting on a system equals its change in kinetic energy. In equation form, this is 7.43 If only conservative forces act, then 7.44 where WcWc is the total work done by all conservative forces. Thus, WcWc 7.45 Now, if the conservative force, such as the gravitational force or a spring force, does work, the system loses potential energy. That is, Wc=−ΔPEWc=−ΔPE. Therefore, Wc=−ΔPEWc=−ΔPE 7.46 or 7.47 This equation means that the total kinetic and potential energy is constant for any process involving only conservative forces. That is, 7.48 where i and f denote initial and final values. This equation is a form of the work-energy theorem for conservative forces; it is known as the conservation of mechanical energy principle. Remember that this applies to the extent that all the forces are conservative, so that friction is negligible. The total kinetic plus potential energy of a system is defined to be its mechanical energy, (KE+PE)(KE+PE). In a system that experiences only conservative forces, there is a potential energy associated with each force, and the energy only changes form between KEKE and the various types of PEPE, with the total energy remaining constant. conservation of mechanical energy mechanical energy (KE+PE)(KE+PE) KEKE PEPE Example 7.8 A 0.100-kg toy car is propelled by a compressed spring, as shown in Figure 7.12. The car follows a track that rises 0.180 m above the starting point. The spring is compressed 4.00 cm and has a force constant of 250.0 N/m. Assuming work done by friction to be negligible, find (a) how fast the car is going before it starts up the slope and (b) how fast it is going at the top of the slope. Figure 7.12 A toy car is pushed by a compressed spring and coasts up a slope. Assuming negligible friction, the potential energy in the spring is first completely converted to kinetic energy, and then to a combination of kinetic and gravitational potential energy as the car rises. The details of the path are unimportant because all forces are conservative—the car would have the same final speed if it took the alternate path shown. The spring force and the gravitational force are conservative forces, so conservation of mechanical energy can be used. Thus, 7.49 or 7.50 where hh is the height (vertical position) and xx is the compression of the spring. This general statement looks complex but becomes much simpler when we start considering specific situations. First, we must identify the initial and final conditions in a problem; then, we enter them into the last equation to solve for an unknown. hh xx This part of the problem is limited to conditions just before the car is released and just after it leaves the spring. Take the initial height to be zero, so that both hihi and hfhf are zero. Furthermore, the initial speed vivi is zero and the final compression of the spring xfxf is zero, and so several terms in the conservation of mechanical energy equation are zero and it simplifies to hihi hfhf vivi xfxf 7.51 In other words, the initial potential energy in the spring is converted completely to kinetic energy in the absence of friction. Solving for the final speed and entering known values yields 7.52 One method of finding the speed at the top of the slope is to consider conditions just before the car is released and just after it reaches the top of the slope, completely ignoring everything in between. Doing the same type of analysis to find which terms are zero, the conservation of mechanical energy becomes 7.53 This form of the equation means that the spring’s initial potential energy is converted partly to gravitational potential energy and partly to kinetic energy. The final speed at the top of the slope will be less than at the bottom. Solving for vfvf and substituting known values gives vfvf 7.54 Another way to solve this problem is to realize that the car’s kinetic energy before it goes up the slope is converted partly to potential energy—that is, to take the final conditions in part (a) to be the initial conditions in part (b). Note that, for conservative forces, we do not directly calculate the work they do; rather, we consider their effects through their corresponding potential energies, just as we did in Example 7.8. Note also that we do not consider details of the path taken—only the starting and ending points are important (as long as the path is not impossible). This assumption is usually a tremendous simplification, because the path may be complicated and forces may vary along the way.

Page 69,"Forces are either conservative or nonconservative. Conservative forces were discussed in Conservative Forces and Potential Energy. A nonconservative force is one for which work depends on the path taken. Friction is a good example of a nonconservative force. As illustrated in Figure 7.13, work done against friction depends on the length of the path between the starting and ending points. Because of this dependence on path, there is no potential energy associated with nonconservative forces. An important characteristic is that the work done by a nonconservative force adds or removes mechanical energy from a system. Friction, for example, creates thermal energy that dissipates, removing energy from the system. Furthermore, even if the thermal energy is retained or captured, it cannot be fully converted back to work, so it is lost or not recoverable in that sense as well. nonconservative force Friction thermal energy Figure 7.13 The amount of the happy face erased depends on the path taken by the eraser between points A and B, as does the work done against friction. Less work is done and less of the face is erased for the path in (a) than for the path in (b). The force here is friction, and most of the work goes into thermal energy that subsequently leaves the system (the happy face plus the eraser). The energy expended cannot be fully recovered."
Page 69,"Mechanical energy may not be conserved when nonconservative forces act. For example, when a car is brought to a stop by friction on level ground, it loses kinetic energy, which is dissipated as thermal energy, reducing its mechanical energy. Figure 7.14 compares the effects of conservative and nonconservative forces. We often choose to understand simpler systems such as that described in Figure 7.14(a) first before studying more complicated systems as in Figure 7.14(b). Figure 7.14 Comparison of the effects of conservative and nonconservative forces on the mechanical energy of a system. (a) A system with only conservative forces. When a rock is dropped onto a spring, its mechanical energy remains constant (neglecting air resistance) because the force in the spring is conservative. The spring can propel the rock back to its original height, where it once again has only potential energy due to gravity. (b) A system with nonconservative forces. When the same rock is dropped onto the ground, it is stopped by nonconservative forces that dissipate its mechanical energy as thermal energy, sound, and surface distortion. The rock has lost mechanical energy."
Page 69,"Now let us consider what form the work-energy theorem takes when both conservative and nonconservative forces act. We will see that the work done by nonconservative forces equals the change in the mechanical energy of a system. As noted in  Kinetic Energy and the Work-Energy Theorem, the work-energy theorem states that the net work on a system equals the change in its kinetic energy, or Wnet=ΔKEWnet=ΔKE. The net work is the sum of the work by nonconservative forces plus the work by conservative forces. That is, Wnet=ΔKEWnet=ΔKE 7.55 so that 7.56 where WncWnc is the total work done by all nonconservative forces and WcWc is the total work done by all conservative forces. WncWnc WcWc Figure 7.15 A person pushes a crate up a ramp, doing work on the crate. Friction and gravitational force (not shown) also do work on the crate; both forces oppose the person’s push. As the crate is pushed up the ramp, it gains mechanical energy, implying that the work done by the person is greater than the work done by friction. Consider Figure 7.15, in which a person pushes a crate up a ramp and is opposed by friction. As in the previous section, we note that work done by a conservative force comes from a loss of gravitational potential energy, so that Wc=−ΔPEWc=−ΔPE. Substituting this equation into the previous one and solving for WncWnc gives Wc=−ΔPEWc=−ΔPE WncWnc 7.57 This equation means that the total mechanical energy (KE + PE)(KE + PE) changes by exactly the amount of work done by nonconservative forces. In Figure 7.15, this is the work done by the person minus the work done by friction. So even if energy is not conserved for the system of interest (such as the crate), we know that an equal amount of work was done to cause the change in total mechanical energy. (KE + PE)(KE + PE) We rearrange Wnc=ΔKE+ΔPEWnc=ΔKE+ΔPE to obtain Wnc=ΔKE+ΔPEWnc=ΔKE+ΔPE 7.58 This means that the amount of work done by nonconservative forces adds to the mechanical energy of a system. If WncWnc is positive, then mechanical energy is increased, such as when the person pushes the crate up the ramp in Figure 7.15. If WncWnc is negative, then mechanical energy is decreased, such as when the rock hits the ground in Figure 7.14(b). If WncWnc is zero, then mechanical energy is conserved, and nonconservative forces are balanced. For example, when you push a lawn mower at constant speed on level ground, your work done is removed by the work of friction, and the mower has a constant energy. WncWnc WncWnc WncWnc"

Using energy considerations, calculate the distance the 65.0-kg baseball player slides, given that his initial speed is 6.00 m/s and the force of friction against him is a constant 450 N. Figure 7.16 The baseball player slides to a stop in a distance dd. In the process, friction removes the player’s kinetic energy by doing an amount of work fdfd equal to the initial kinetic energy. Friction stops the player by converting his kinetic energy into other forms, including thermal energy. In terms of the work-energy theorem, the work done by friction, which is negative, is added to the initial kinetic energy to reduce it to zero. The work done by friction is negative, because ff is in the opposite direction of the motion (that is, θ=180ºθ=180º, and so cosθ=−1cosθ=−1). Thus Wnc=−fdWnc=−fd. The equation simplifies to ff θ=180ºθ=180º cosθ=−1cosθ=−1 Wnc=−fdWnc=−fd 7.59 or 7.60 This equation can now be solved for the distance dd. dd Solving the previous equation for dd and substituting known values yields dd 7.61 The most important point of this example is that the amount of nonconservative work equals the change in mechanical energy. For example, you must work harder to stop a truck, with its large mechanical energy, than to stop a mosquito. Example 7.10 Suppose that the player from Example 7.9 is running up a hill having a 5.00º5.00º incline upward with a surface similar to that in the baseball stadium. The player slides with the same initial speed, and the frictional force is still 450 N. Determine how far he slides. 5.00º5.00º Figure 7.17 The same baseball player slides to a stop on a 5.00º5.00º slope. In this case, the work done by the nonconservative friction force on the player reduces the mechanical energy he has from his kinetic energy at zero height, to the final mechanical energy he has by moving through distance dd to reach height hh along the hill, with h=dsin5.00ºh=dsin5.00º. This is expressed by the equation dd hh h=dsin5.00ºh=dsin5.00º 7.62 The work done by friction is again Wnc=−fdWnc=−fd; initially the potential energy is PEi=mg⋅0=0PEi=mg⋅0=0 and the kinetic energy is

Note that the problem could also have been solved in terms of the forces directly and the work energy theorem, instead of using the potential energy. This method would have required combining the normal force and force of gravity vectors, which no longer cancel each other because they point in different directions, and friction, to find the net force. You could then use the net force and the net work to find the distance dd that reduces the kinetic energy to zero. By applying conservation of energy and using the potential energy instead, we need only consider the gravitational potential energy mghmgh, without combining and resolving force vectors. This simplifies the solution considerably. dd mghmgh Making Connections: Take-Home Investigation—Determining Friction from the Stopping Distance This experiment involves the conversion of gravitational potential energy into thermal energy. Use the ruler, book, and marble from Take-Home Investigation—Converting Potential to Kinetic Energy. In addition, you will need a foam cup with a small hole in the side, as shown in Figure 7.18. From the 10-cm position on the ruler, let the marble roll into the cup positioned at the bottom of the ruler. Measure the distance dd the cup moves before stopping. What forces caused it to stop? What happened to the kinetic energy of the marble at the bottom of the ruler? Next, place the marble at the 20-cm and the 30-cm positions and again measure the distance the cup moves after the marble enters it. Plot the distance the cup moves versus the initial marble position on the ruler. Is this relationship linear? dd With some simple assumptions, you can use these data to find the coefficient of kinetic friction μkμk of the cup on the table. The force of friction ff on the cup is μkNμkN, where the normal force NN is just the weight of the cup plus the marble.

Page 70,"Energy, as we have noted, is conserved, making it one of the most important physical quantities in nature. The law of conservation of energy can be stated as follows: law of conservation of energy Total energy is constant in any process. It may change in form or be transferred from one system to another, but the total remains the same. We have explored some forms of energy and some ways it can be transferred from one system to another. This exploration led to the definition of two major types of energy—mechanical energy KE+PEKE+PE and energy transferred via work done by nonconservative forces (Wnc)(Wnc). But energy takes many other forms, manifesting itself in many different ways, and we need to be able to deal with all of these before we can write an equation for the above general statement of the conservation of energy. KE+PEKE+PE (Wnc)(Wnc)"

Kinetic energy is KEKE, work done by a conservative force is represented by PEPE, work done by nonconservative forces is WncWnc, and all other energies are included as OEOE.

When does OEOE play a role? One example occurs when a person eats. Food is oxidized with the release of carbon dioxide, water, and energy. Some of this chemical energy is converted to kinetic energy when the person moves, to potential energy when the person changes altitude, and to thermal energy (another form of OEOE). OEOE OEOE"

Page 70,"What are some other forms of energy? You can probably name a number of forms of energy not yet discussed. Many of these will be covered in later chapters, but let us detail a few here. Electrical energy is a common form that is converted to many other forms and does work in a wide range of practical situations. Fuels, such as gasoline and food, carry chemical energy that can be transferred to a system through oxidation. Chemical fuel can also produce electrical energy, such as in batteries. Batteries can in turn produce light, which is a very pure form of energy. Most energy sources on Earth are in fact stored energy from the energy we receive from the Sun. We sometimes refer to this as radiant energy, or electromagnetic radiation, which includes visible light, infrared, and ultraviolet radiation. Nuclear energy comes from processes that convert measurable amounts of mass into energy. Nuclear energy is transformed into the energy of sunlight, into electrical energy in power plants, and into the energy of the heat transfer and blast in weapons. Atoms and molecules inside all objects are in random motion. This internal mechanical energy from the random motions is called thermal energy, because it is related to the temperature of the object. These and all other forms of energy can be converted into one another and can do work. Electrical energy chemical energy radiant energy Nuclear energy thermal energy Table 7.1 gives the amount of energy stored, used, or released from various objects and in various phenomena. The range of energies and the variety of types and situations is impressive."
Page 70,"The transformation of energy from one form into others is happening all the time. The chemical energy in food is converted into thermal energy through metabolism; light energy is converted into chemical energy through photosynthesis. In a larger example, the chemical energy contained in coal is converted into thermal energy as it burns to turn water into steam in a boiler. This thermal energy in the steam in turn is converted to mechanical energy as it spins a turbine, which is connected to a generator to produce electrical energy. (In all of these examples, not all of the initial energy is converted into the forms mentioned. This important point is discussed later in this section.) Another example of energy conversion occurs in a solar cell. Sunlight impinging on a solar cell (see Figure 7.19) produces electricity, which in turn can be used to run an electric motor. Energy is converted from the primary source of solar energy into electrical energy and then into mechanical energy.

Figure 7.20 This powerful rocket on the Space Shuttle Endeavor did work and consumed energy at a very high rate. (credit: NASA) These images of power have in common the rapid performance of work, consistent with the scientific definition of power (PP) as the rate at which work is done. power PP Power Power is the rate at which work is done. 7.69 The SI unit for power is the watt (WW), where 1 watt equals 1 joule/second (1 W=1 J/s).(1 W=1 J/s). watt WW (1 W=1 J/s).(1 W=1 J/s). Because work is energy transfer, power is also the rate at which energy is expended. A 60-W light bulb, for example, expends 60 J of energy per second. Great power means a large amount of work or energy developed in a short time. For example, when a powerful car accelerates rapidly, it does a large amount of work and consumes a large amount of fuel in a short time."

Figure 7.21 When this woman runs upstairs starting from rest, she converts the chemical energy originally from food into kinetic energy and gravitational potential energy. Her power output depends on how fast she does this. The work going into mechanical energy is W=  KE +  PEW=  KE +  PE. At the bottom of the stairs, we take both KEKE and

It is impressive that this woman’s useful power output is slightly less than 1 horsepower (1 hp=746 W)(1 hp=746 W)! People can generate more than a horsepower with their leg muscles for short periods of time by rapidly converting available blood sugar and oxygen into work output. (A horse can put out 1 hp for hours on end.) Once oxygen is depleted, power output decreases and the person begins to breathe rapidly to obtain oxygen to metabolize more food—this is known as the aerobic stage of exercise. If the woman climbed the stairs slowly, then her power output would be much less, although the amount of work done would be the same. horsepower (1 hp=746 W)(1 hp=746 W) Making Connections: Take-Home Investigation—Measure Your Power Rating Determine your own power rating by measuring the time it takes you to climb a flight of stairs. We will ignore the gain in kinetic energy, as the above example showed that it was a small portion of the energy gain. Don’t expect that your output will be more than about 0.5 hp."
Page 71,"Examples of power are limited only by the imagination, because there are as many types as there are forms of work and energy. (See Table 7.3 for some examples.) Sunlight reaching Earth’s surface carries a maximum power of about 1.3 kilowatts per square meter (kW/m2).(kW/m2). A tiny fraction of this is retained by Earth over the long term. Our consumption rate of fossil fuels is far greater than the rate at which they are stored, so it is inevitable that they will be depleted. Power implies that energy is transferred, perhaps changing form. It is never possible to change one form completely into another without losing some of it as thermal energy. For example, a 60-W incandescent bulb converts only 5 W of electrical power to light, with 55 W dissipating into thermal energy. Furthermore, the typical electric power plant converts only 35 to 40% of its fuel into electricity. The remainder becomes a huge amount of thermal energy that must be dispersed as heat transfer, as rapidly as it is created. A coal-fired power plant may produce 1000 megawatts; 1 megawatt (MW) is 106 W106 W of electric power. But the power plant consumes chemical energy at a rate of about 2500 MW, creating heat transfer to the surroundings at a rate of 1500 MW. (See Figure 7.22.) (kW/m2).(kW/m2). 106 W106 W Figure 7.22 Tremendous amounts of electric power are generated by coal-fired power plants such as this one in China, but an even larger amount of power goes into heat transfer to the surroundings. The large cooling towers here are needed to transfer heat as rapidly as it is produced. The transfer of heat is not unique to coal plants but is an unavoidable consequence of generating electric power from any fuel—nuclear, coal, oil, natural gas, or the like.

Page 71,"We usually have to pay for the energy we use. It is interesting and easy to estimate the cost of energy for an electrical appliance if its power consumption rate and time used are known. The higher the power consumption rate and the longer the appliance is used, the greater the cost of that appliance. The power consumption rate is P=W/t=E/tP=W/t=E/t, where EE is the energy supplied by the electricity company. So the energy consumed over a time tt is P=W/t=E/tP=W/t=E/t EE tt 7.72 Electricity bills state the energy used in units of kilowatt-hours (kW⋅h),(kW⋅h), which is the product of power in kilowatts and time in hours. This unit is convenient because electrical power consumption at the kilowatt level for hours at a time is typical. kilowatt-hours (kW⋅h),(kW⋅h), Example 7.12 What is the cost of running a 0.200-kW computer 6.00 h per day for 30.0 d if the cost of electricity is $0.120 per kW⋅hkW⋅h? kW⋅hkW⋅h Cost is based on energy consumed; thus, we must find EE from E=PtE=Pt and then calculate the cost. Because electrical energy is expressed in kW⋅hkW⋅h, at the start of a problem such as this it is convenient to convert the units into kWkW and hours. EE E=PtE=Pt kW⋅hkW⋅h kWkW The energy consumed in kW⋅hkW⋅h is kW⋅hkW⋅h 7.73 and the cost is simply given by 7.74 The cost of using the computer in this example is neither exorbitant nor negligible. It is clear that the cost is a combination of power and time. When both are high, such as for an air conditioner in the summer, the cost is high. The motivation to save energy has become more compelling with its ever-increasing price. Armed with the knowledge that energy consumed is the product of power and time, you can estimate costs for yourself and make the necessary value judgments about where to save energy. Either power or time must be reduced. It is most cost-effective to limit the use of high-power devices that normally operate for long periods of time, such as water heaters and air conditioners. This would not include relatively high power devices like toasters, because they are on only a few minutes per day. It would also not include electric clocks, in spite of their 24-hour-per-day usage, because they are very low power devices. It is sometimes possible to use devices that have greater efficiencies—that is, devices that consume less power to accomplish the same task. One example is the compact fluorescent light bulb, which produces over four times more light per watt of power consumed than its incandescent cousin. Modern civilization depends on energy, but current levels of energy consumption and production are not sustainable. The likelihood of a link between global warming and fossil fuel use (with its concomitant production of carbon dioxide), has made reduction in energy use as well as a shift to non-fossil fuels of the utmost importance. Even though energy in an isolated system is a conserved quantity, the final result of most energy transformations is waste heat transfer to the environment, which is no longer useful for doing work. As we will discuss in more detail in Thermodynamics, the potential for energy to produce useful work has been “degraded” in the energy transformation."

Page 72,"Our own bodies, like all living organisms, are energy conversion machines. Conservation of energy implies that the chemical energy stored in food is converted into work, thermal energy, and/or stored as chemical energy in fatty tissue. (See Figure 7.23.) The fraction going into each form depends both on how much we eat and on our level of physical activity. If we eat more than is needed to do work and stay warm, the remainder goes into body fat. Figure 7.23 Energy consumed by humans is converted to work, thermal energy, and stored fat. By far the largest fraction goes to thermal energy, although the fraction varies depending on the type of physical activity."
Page 72,"The rate at which the body uses food energy to sustain life and to do different activities is called the metabolic rate. The total energy conversion rate of a person at rest is called the basal metabolic rate (BMR) and is divided among various systems in the body, as shown in Table 7.4. The largest fraction goes to the liver and spleen, with the brain coming next. Of course, during vigorous exercise, the energy consumption of the skeletal muscles and heart increase markedly. About 75% of the calories burned in a day go into these basic functions. The BMR is a function of age, gender, total body weight, and amount of muscle mass (which burns more calories than body fat). Athletes have a greater BMR due to this last factor. metabolic rate basal metabolic rate Table 7.4 Basal Metabolic Rates (BMR) Energy consumption is directly proportional to oxygen consumption because the digestive process is basically one of oxidizing food. We can measure the energy people use during various activities by measuring their oxygen use. (See Figure 7.24.) Approximately 20 kJ of energy are produced for each liter of oxygen consumed, independent of the type of food. Table 7.5 shows energy and oxygen consumption rates (power expended) for a variety of activities."
Page 72,"Work done by a person is sometimes called useful work, which is work done on the outside world, such as lifting weights. Useful work requires a force exerted through a distance on the outside world, and so it excludes internal work, such as that done by the heart when pumping blood. Useful work does include that done in climbing stairs or accelerating to a full run, because these are accomplished by exerting forces on the outside world. Forces exerted by the body are nonconservative, so that they can change the mechanical energy (KE + PEKE + PE) of the system worked upon, and this is often the goal. A baseball player throwing a ball, for example, increases both the ball’s kinetic and potential energy. useful work KE + PEKE + PE If a person needs more energy than they consume, such as when doing vigorous work, the body must draw upon the chemical energy stored in fat. So exercise can be helpful in losing fat. However, the amount of exercise needed to produce a loss in fat, or to burn off extra calories consumed that day, can be large, as Example 7.13 illustrates. Example 7.13 If a person who normally requires an average of 12,000 kJ (3000 kcal) of food energy per day consumes 13,000 kJ per day, they will steadily add body fat. How much bicycling per day is required to work off this extra 1000 kJ? Table 7.5 states that 400 W are used when cycling at a moderate speed. The time required to work off 1000 kJ at this rate is then 7.75 If this person uses more energy than they consume, the person’s body will obtain the needed energy by metabolizing body fat. If the person uses 13,000 kJ but consumes only 12,000 kJ, then the amount of fat loss will be 7.76 assuming the energy content of fat to be 39 kJ/g. Figure 7.24 A pulse oxymeter is an apparatus that measures the amount of oxygen in blood. A knowledge of oxygen and carbon dioxide levels indicates a person’s metabolic rate, which is the rate at which food energy is converted to another form. Such measurements can indicate the level of athletic conditioning as well as certain medical problems. (credit: UusiAjaja, Wikimedia Commons) Table 7.5 Energy and Oxygen Consumption Rates2 (Power) All bodily functions, from thinking to lifting weights, require energy. (See Figure 7.25.) The many small muscle actions accompanying all quiet activity, from sleeping to head scratching, ultimately become thermal energy, as do less visible muscle actions by the heart, lungs, and digestive tract. Shivering, in fact, is an involuntary response to low body temperature that pits muscles against one another to produce thermal energy in the body (and do no work). The kidneys and liver consume a surprising amount of energy, but the biggest surprise of all is that a full 25% of all energy consumed by the body is used to maintain electrical potentials in all living cells. (Nerve cells use this electrical potential in nerve impulses.) This bioelectrical energy ultimately becomes mostly thermal energy, but some is utilized to power chemical processes such as in the kidneys and liver, and in fat production.

Page 73,"The principal energy resources used in the world are shown in Figure 7.26. The fuel mix has changed over the years but now is dominated by oil, although natural gas and solar contributions are increasing. Renewable forms of energy are those sources that cannot be used up, such as water, wind, solar, and biomass. About 85% of our energy comes from nonrenewable fossil fuels—oil, natural gas, coal. The likelihood of a link between global warming and fossil fuel use, with its production of carbon dioxide through combustion, has made, in the eyes of many scientists, a shift to non-fossil fuels of utmost importance—but it will not be easy. Renewable forms of energy fossil fuels Figure 7.26 World energy consumption by source, in billions of kilowatt-hours: 2006. (credit: KVDP)"
Page 73,"World energy consumption continues to rise, especially in the developing countries. (See Figure 7.27.) Global demand for energy has tripled in the past 50 years and might triple again in the next 30 years. While much of this growth will come from the rapidly booming economies of China and India, many of the developed countries, especially those in Europe, are hoping to meet their energy needs by expanding the use of renewable sources. Although presently only a small percentage, renewable energy is growing very fast, especially wind energy. For example, Germany plans to meet 65% of its power and 30% of its overall energy needs with renewable resources by the year 2030. (See Figure 7.28.) Energy is a key constraint in the rapid economic growth of China and India. In 2003, China surpassed Japan as the world’s second largest consumer of oil. However, over 1/3 of this is imported. Unlike most Western countries, coal dominates the commercial energy resources of China, accounting for 2/3 of its energy consumption. In 2009 China surpassed the United States as the largest generator of CO2CO2. In India, the main energy resources are biomass (wood and dung) and coal. Half of India’s oil is imported. About 70% of India’s electricity is generated by highly polluting coal. Yet there are sizeable strides being made in renewable energy. India has a rapidly growing wind energy base, and it has the largest solar cooking program in the world. China has invested substantially in building solar collection farms as well as hydroelectric plants. CO2CO2 Figure 7.27 Past and projected world energy use (source: Based on data from U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2021) Figure 7.28 Solar cell arrays at a power plant in California (credit: Bureau of Land Management, Flickr) Table 7.6 displays the 2020 commercial energy mix by country for some of the prime energy users in the world. While non-renewable sources dominate, some countries get a sizeable percentage of their electricity from renewable resources. For example, about two-thirds of New Zealand’s electricity demand is met by hydroelectric. Only 10% of the U.S. electricity is generated by renewable resources, primarily hydroelectric. It is difficult to determine total sources and consumers of energy in many countries, and estimates vary somewhat by data source and type of measurement. Table 7.6 Energy Consumption—Selected Countries (2020)"
Page 73,"Economic well-being is dependent upon energy use, and in most countries higher standards of living, as measured by GDP (gross domestic product) per capita, are matched by higher levels of energy consumption per capita. This is borne out in Figure 7.29. Increased efficiency of energy use will change this dependency. A global problem is balancing energy resource development against the harmful effects upon the environment in its extraction and use. New and diversified energy sources do, however, greatly increase economic opportunity and stability. First, the extensive employment opportunities in renewable energy make it one of the most sustainable and secure fields to enter. Second, renewable energy provides countries and localities with increased levels of resiliency in the face of natural disasters, conflict, or other disruptions. The 21st century has already seen major economic impacts from energy disruptions: Hurricane Katrina, Superstorm Sandy, various wildfires, Hurricane Maria, and the 2021 Texas Winter Storm demonstrate the vulnerability of United States power systems. Diversifying energy sources through renewables and other fossil-fuel alternatives brings power grids and transportation systems back online much more quickly, saving lives and enabling a more swift return to economic operations. And as critical emerging information infrastructure, such as data centers, requires more of the world's energy, supplying those growing systems during normal operations and crises will be increasingly important.

Page 73,"As we finish this chapter on energy and work, it is relevant to draw some distinctions between two sometimes misunderstood terms in the area of energy use. As has been mentioned elsewhere, the “law of the conservation of energy” is a very useful principle in analyzing physical processes. It is a statement that cannot be proven from basic principles, but is a very good bookkeeping device, and no exceptions have ever been found. It states that the total amount of energy in an isolated system will always remain constant. Related to this principle, but remarkably different from it, is the important philosophy of energy conservation. This concept has to do with seeking to decrease the amount of energy used by an individual or group through (1) reduced activities (e.g., turning down thermostats, driving fewer kilometers) and/or (2) increasing conversion efficiencies in the performance of a particular task—such as developing and using more efficient room heaters, cars that have greater miles-per-gallon ratings, energy-efficient compact fluorescent lights, etc. Since energy in an isolated system is not destroyed or created or generated, one might wonder why we need to be concerned about our energy resources, since energy is a conserved quantity. The problem is that the final result of most energy transformations is waste heat transfer to the environment and conversion to energy forms no longer useful for doing work. To state it in another way, the potential for energy to produce useful work has been “degraded” in the energy transformation. (This will be discussed in more detail in Thermodynamics.)"

Page 79,"The scientific definition of linear momentum is consistent with most people’s intuitive understanding of momentum: a large, fast-moving object has greater momentum than a smaller, slower object. Linear momentum is defined as the product of a system’s mass multiplied by its velocity. In symbols, linear momentum is expressed as Linear momentum 8.1 Momentum is directly proportional to the object’s mass and also its velocity. Thus the greater an object’s mass or the greater its velocity, the greater its momentum. Momentum pp is a vector having the same direction as the velocity vv. The SI unit for momentum is kg·m/skg·m/s. pp vv kg·m/skg·m/s Linear Momentum Linear momentum is defined as the product of a system’s mass multiplied by its velocity: 8.2 Example 8.1 (a) Calculate the momentum of a 110-kg football player running at 8.00 m/s. (b) Compare the player’s momentum with the momentum of a hard-thrown 0.410-kg football that has a speed of 25.0 m/s. No information is given regarding direction, and so we can calculate only the magnitude of the momentum, pp. (As usual, a symbol that is in italics is a magnitude, whereas one that is italicized, boldfaced, and has an arrow is a vector.) In both parts of this example, the magnitude of momentum can be calculated directly from the definition of momentum given in the equation, which becomes pp 8.3 when only magnitudes are considered. To determine the momentum of the player, substitute the known values for the player’s mass and speed into the equation. 8.4 To determine the momentum of the ball, substitute the known values for the ball’s mass and speed into the equation. 8.5 The ratio of the player’s momentum to that of the ball is 8.6 Although the ball has greater velocity, the player has a much greater mass. Thus the momentum of the player is much greater than the momentum of the football, as you might guess. As a result, the player’s motion is only slightly affected if he catches the ball. We shall quantify what happens in such collisions in terms of momentum in later sections."

Page 79,"The importance of momentum, unlike the importance of energy, was recognized early in the development of classical physics. Momentum was deemed so important that it was called the “quantity of motion.” Newton actually stated his second law of motion in terms of momentum: The net external force equals the change in momentum of a system divided by the time over which it changes. Using symbols, this law is second law of motion 8.7 where FnetFnet is the net external force, ΔpΔp is the change in momentum, and ΔtΔt is the change in time. FnetFnet ΔpΔp ΔtΔt Newton’s Second Law of Motion in Terms of Momentum The net external force equals the change in momentum of a system divided by the time over which it changes. 8.8 Making Connections: Force and Momentum Force and momentum are intimately related. Force acting over time can change momentum, and Newton’s second law of motion, can be stated in its most broadly applicable form in terms of momentum. Momentum continues to be a key concept in the study of atomic and subatomic particles in quantum mechanics. This statement of Newton’s second law of motion includes the more familiar Fnet = maFnet = ma as a special case. We can derive this form as follows. First, note that the change in momentum ΔpΔp is given by Fnet = maFnet = ma ΔpΔp 8.9 If the mass of the system is constant, then 8.10 So that for constant mass, Newton’s second law of motion becomes 8.11 Because ΔvΔt=aΔvΔt=a, we get the familiar equation ΔvΔt=aΔvΔt=a 8.12 when the mass of the system is constant. Newton’s second law of motion stated in terms of momentum is more generally applicable because it can be applied to systems where the mass is changing, such as rockets, as well as to systems of constant mass. We will consider systems with varying mass in some detail; however, the relationship between momentum and force remains useful when mass is constant, such as in the following example. Example 8.2 During the 2007 French Open, Venus Williams hit the fastest recorded serve in a premier women’s match, reaching a speed of 58 m/s (209 km/h). What is the average force exerted on the 0.057-kg tennis ball by Venus Williams’ racquet, assuming that the ball’s speed just after impact is 58 m/s, that the initial horizontal component of the velocity before impact is negligible, and that the ball remained in contact with the racquet for 5.0 ms (milliseconds)? This problem involves only one dimension because the ball starts from having no horizontal velocity component before impact. Newton’s second law stated in terms of momentum is then written as 8.13 As noted above, when mass is constant, the change in momentum is given by 8.14 In this example, the velocity just after impact and the change in time are given; thus, once ΔpΔp is calculated, Fnet=ΔpΔtFnet=ΔpΔt can be used to find the force. ΔpΔp Fnet=ΔpΔtFnet=ΔpΔt To determine the change in momentum, substitute the values for the initial and final velocities into the equation above. 8.15 Now the magnitude of the net external force can determined by using Fnet=ΔpΔtFnet=ΔpΔt: Fnet=ΔpΔtFnet=ΔpΔt 8.16 where we have retained only two significant figures in the final step. This quantity was the average force exerted by Venus Williams’ racquet on the tennis ball during its brief impact (note that the ball also experienced the 0.56-N force of gravity, but that force was not due to the racquet). This problem could also be solved by first finding the acceleration and then using Fnet=maFnet=ma, but one additional step would be required compared with the strategy used in this example. Fnet=maFnet=ma"

Page 80,"Change in momentum equals the average net external force multiplied by the time this force acts. 8.18 The quantity FnetΔtFnetΔt is given the name impulse. FnetΔtFnetΔt There are many ways in which an understanding of impulse can save lives, or at least limbs. The dashboard padding in a car, and certainly the airbags, allow the net force on the occupants in the car to act over a much longer time when there is a sudden stop. The momentum change is the same for an occupant, whether an air bag is deployed or not, but the force (to bring the occupant to a stop) will be much less if it acts over a larger time. Cars today have many plastic components. One advantage of plastics is their lighter weight, which results in better gas mileage. Another advantage is that a car will crumple in a collision, especially in the event of a head-on collision. A longer collision time means the force on the car will be less. Deaths during car races decreased dramatically when the rigid frames of racing cars were replaced with parts that could crumple or collapse in the event of an accident. Bones in a body will fracture if the force on them is too large. If you jump onto the floor from a table, the force on your legs can be immense if you land stiff-legged on a hard surface. Rolling on the ground after jumping from the table, or landing with a parachute, extends the time over which the force (on you from the ground) acts."

Page 81,"The conservation of momentum principle not only applies to the macroscopic objects, it is also essential to our explorations of atomic and subatomic particles. Giant machines hurl subatomic particles at one another, and researchers evaluate the results by assuming conservation of momentum (among other things). On the small scale, we find that particles and their properties are invisible to the naked eye but can be measured with our instruments, and models of these subatomic particles can be constructed to describe the results. Momentum is found to be a property of all subatomic particles including massless particles such as photons that compose light. Momentum being a property of particles hints that momentum may have an identity beyond the description of an object’s mass multiplied by the object’s velocity. Indeed, momentum relates to wave properties and plays a fundamental role in what measurements are taken and how we take these measurements. Furthermore, we find that the conservation of momentum principle is valid when considering systems of particles. We use this principle to analyze the masses and other properties of previously undetected particles, such as the nucleus of an atom and the existence of quarks that make up particles of nuclei. Figure 8.5 below illustrates how a particle scattering backward from another implies that its target is massive and dense. Experiments seeking evidence that quarks make up protons (one type of particle that makes up nuclei) scattered high-energy electrons off of protons (nuclei of hydrogen atoms). Electrons occasionally scattered straight backward in a manner that implied a very small and very dense particle makes up the proton—this observation is considered nearly direct evidence of quarks. The analysis was based partly on the same conservation of momentum principle that works so well on the large scale. quarks Figure 8.5 A subatomic particle scatters straight backward from a target particle. In experiments seeking evidence for quarks, electrons were observed to occasionally scatter straight backward from a proton."

Page 84,"Some interesting situations arise when the two colliding objects have equal mass and the collision is elastic. This situation is nearly the case with colliding billiard balls, and precisely the case with some subatomic particle collisions. We can thus get a mental image of a collision of subatomic particles by thinking about billiards (or pool). (Refer to Figure 8.10 for masses and angles.) First, an elastic collision conserves internal kinetic energy. Again, let us assume object 2 m2m2 is initially at rest. Then, the internal kinetic energy before and after the collision of two objects that have equal masses is m2m2 8.74 Because the masses are equal, m1=m2=mm1=m2=m. Algebraic manipulation (left to the reader) of conservation of momentum in the xx- and yy-directions can show that m1=m2=mm1=m2=m xx yy 8.75 (Remember that θ2θ2 is negative here.) The two preceding equations can both be true only if θ2θ2 8.76 There are three ways that this term can be zero. They are All three of these ways are familiar occurrences in billiards and pool, although most of us try to avoid the second. If you play enough pool, you will notice that the angle between the balls is very close to 90º90º after the collision, although it will vary from this value if a great deal of spin is placed on the ball. (Large spin carries in extra energy and a quantity called angular momentum, which must also be conserved.) The assumption that the scattering of billiard balls is elastic is reasonable based on the correctness of the three results it produces. This assumption also implies that, to a good approximation, momentum is conserved for the two-ball system in billiards and pool. The problems below explore these and other characteristics of two-dimensional collisions. 90º90º Connections to Nuclear and Particle Physics Two-dimensional collision experiments have revealed much of what we know about subatomic particles, as we shall see in Medical Applications of Nuclear Physics and Particle Physics. Ernest Rutherford, for example, discovered the nature of the atomic nucleus from such experiments."

When she hits the brake, the angular acceleration is large and negative. The angular velocity quickly goes to zero. In both cases, the relationships are analogous to what happens with linear motion. For example, there is a large deceleration when you crash into a brick wall—the velocity change is large in a short time interval."
Page 102,"Solution The magnitude of angular acceleration is αα and its most common units are rad/s2rad/s2. The direction of angular acceleration along a fixed axis is denoted by a + or a – sign, just as the direction of linear acceleration in one dimension is denoted by a + or a – sign.

The magnitude of her angular acceleration would be proportional to her angular velocity (spin rate) and her moment of inertia about her spin axis. αα rad/s2rad/s2"

Page 104,"Before we can consider the rotation of anything other than a point mass like the one in Figure 10.10, we must extend the idea of rotational inertia to all types of objects. To expand our concept of rotational inertia, we define the moment of inertia
II of an object to be the sum of

mr2mr2 for all the point masses of which it is composed. That is,

I=∑mr2I=∑mr2. Here

II is analogous to

mm in translational motion. Because of the distance

rr, the moment of inertia for any object depends on the chosen axis. Actually, calculating

II is beyond the scope of this text except for one simple case—that of a hoop, which has all its mass at the same distance from its axis. A hoop’s moment of inertia around its axis is therefore

MR2MR2, where

MM is its total mass and RR its radius. (We use MM and RR for an entire object to distinguish them from mm and rr for point masses.) In all other cases, we must consult Figure 10.11 (note that the table is piece of artwork that has shapes as well as formulae) for formulas for II that have been derived from integration over the continuous body. Note that II has units of mass multiplied by distance squared (kg⋅m2kg⋅m2), as we might expect from its definition. moment of inertia II mr2mr2 I=∑mr2I=∑mr2 II mm rr II MR2MR2 MM RR MM RR mm rr II II kg⋅m2kg⋅m2 The general relationship among torque, moment of inertia, and angular acceleration is 10.43 or 10.44 where net ττ is the total torque from all forces relative to a chosen axis. For simplicity, we will only consider torques exerted by forces in the plane of the rotation. Such torques are either positive or negative and add like ordinary numbers. The relationship in τ=Iα, α=net τIτ=Iα, α=net τI is the rotational analog to Newton’s second law and is very generally applicable. This equation is actually valid for any torque, applied to any object, relative to any axis. ττ τ=Iα, α=net τIτ=Iα, α=net τI As we might expect, the larger the torque is, the larger the angular acceleration is. For example, the harder a child pushes on a merry-go-round, the faster it accelerates. Furthermore, the more massive a merry-go-round, the slower it accelerates for the same torque. The basic relationship between moment of inertia and angular acceleration is that the larger the moment of inertia, the smaller is the angular acceleration. But there is an additional twist. The moment of inertia depends not only on the mass of an object, but also on its distribution of mass relative to the axis around which it rotates. For example, it will be much easier to accelerate a merry-go-round full of children if they stand close to its axis than if they all stand at the outer edge. The mass is the same in both cases, but the moment of inertia is much larger when the children are at the edge. Take-Home Experiment Cut out a circle that has about a 10 cm radius from stiff cardboard. Near the edge of the circle, write numbers 1 to 12 like hours on a clock face. Position the circle so that it can rotate freely about a horizontal axis through its center, like a wheel. (You could loosely nail the circle to a wall.) Hold the circle stationary and with the number 12 positioned at the top, attach a lump of blue putty (sticky material used for fixing posters to walls) at the number 3. How large does the lump need to be to just rotate the circle? Describe how you can change the moment of inertia of the circle. How does this change affect the amount of blue putty needed at the number 3 to just rotate the circle? Change the circle’s moment of inertia and then try rotating the circle by using different amounts of blue putty. Repeat this process several times. Problem-Solving Strategy for Rotational Dynamics Making Connections In statics, the net torque is zero, and there is no angular acceleration. In rotational motion, net torque is the cause of angular acceleration, exactly as in Newton’s second law of motion for rotation. Figure 10.11 Some rotational inertias. Example 10.7 Consider the father pushing a playground merry-go-round in Figure 10.12. He exerts a force of 250 N at the edge of the 50.0-kg merry-go-round, which has a 1.50 m radius. Calculate the angular acceleration produced (a) when no one is on the merry-go-round and (b) when an 18.0-kg child sits 1.25 m away from the center. Consider the merry-go-round itself to be a uniform disk with negligible retarding friction.

I 10.45 To solve for αα, we must first calculate the torque ττ (which is the same in both cases) and moment of inertia II (which is greater in the second case). To find the torque, we note that the applied force is perpendicular to the radius and friction is negligible, so that αα ττ II 10.46 The moment of inertia of a solid disk about this axis is given in Figure 10.11 to be 10.47 where M=50.0 kgM=50.0 kg and R=1.50 mR=1.50 m, so that M=50.0 kgM=50.0 kg R=1.50 mR=1.50 m 10.48 Now, after we substitute the known values, we find the angular acceleration to be 10.49 We expect the angular acceleration for the system to be less in this part, because the moment of inertia is greater when the child is on the merry-go-round. To find the total moment of inertia II, we first find the child’s moment of inertia IcIc by considering the child to be equivalent to a point mass at a distance of 1.25 m from the axis. Then, II IcIc 10.50 The total moment of inertia is the sum of moments of inertia of the merry-go-round and the child (about the same axis). To justify this sum to yourself, examine the definition of II: II 10.51 Substituting known values into the equation for αα gives αα 10.52 The angular acceleration is less when the child is on the merry-go-round than when the merry-go-round is empty, as expected. The angular accelerations found are quite large, partly due to the fact that friction was considered to be negligible. If, for example, the father kept pushing perpendicularly for 2.00 s, he would give the merry-go-round an angular velocity of 13.3 rad/s when it is empty but only 8.89 rad/s when the child is on it. In terms of revolutions per second, these angular velocities are 2.12 rev/s and 1.41 rev/s, respectively. The father would end up running at about 50 km/h in the first case. Summer Olympics, here he comes! Confirmation of these numbers is left as an exercise for the reader. Check Your Understanding Torque is the analog of force and moment of inertia is the analog of mass. Force and mass are physical quantities that depend on only one factor. For example, mass is related solely to the numbers of atoms of various types in an object. Are torque and moment of inertia similarly simple? Solution No. Torque depends on three factors: force magnitude, force direction, and point of application. Moment of inertia depends on both mass and its distribution relative to the axis of rotation. So, while the analogies are precise, these rotational quantities depend on more factors."

Page 105,"One of the quality controls in a tomato soup factory consists of rolling filled cans down a ramp. If they roll too fast, the soup is too thin. Why should cans of identical size and mass roll down an incline at different rates? And why should the thickest soup roll the slowest? The easiest way to answer these questions is to consider energy. Suppose each can starts down the ramp from rest. Each can starting from rest means each starts with the same gravitational potential energy PEgravPEgrav, which is converted entirely to KEKE, provided each rolls without slipping. KEKE, however, can take the form of KEtransKEtrans or KErotKErot, and total KEKE is the sum of the two. If a can rolls down a ramp, it puts part of its energy into rotation, leaving less for translation. Thus, the can goes slower than it would if it slid down. Furthermore, the thin soup does not rotate, whereas the thick soup does, because it sticks to the can. The thick soup thus puts more of the can’s original gravitational potential energy into rotation than the thin soup, and the can rolls more slowly, as seen in Figure 10.18. PEgravPEgrav KEKE KEKE KEtransKEtrans KErotKErot KEKE Figure 10.18 Three cans of soup with identical masses race down an incline. The first can has a low friction coating and does not roll but just slides down the incline. It wins because it converts its entire PE into translational KE. The second and third cans both roll down the incline without slipping. The second can contains thin soup and comes in second because part of its initial PE goes into rotating the can (but not the thin soup). The third can contains thick soup. It comes in third because the soup rotates along with the can, taking even more of the initial PE for rotational KE, leaving less for translational KE. Assuming no losses due to friction, there is only one force doing work—gravity. Therefore the total work done is the change in kinetic energy. As the cans start moving, the potential energy is changing into kinetic energy. Conservation of energy gives 10.82 More specifically, 10.83 or 10.84 So, the initial mghmgh is divided between translational kinetic energy and rotational kinetic energy; and the greater II is, the less energy goes into translation. If the can slides down without friction, then ω=0ω=0 and all the energy goes into translation; thus, the can goes faster. mghmgh II ω=0ω=0 Take-Home Experiment Locate several cans each containing different types of food. First, predict which can will win the race down an inclined plane and explain why. See if your prediction is correct. You could also do this experiment by collecting several empty cylindrical containers of the same size and filling them with different materials such as wet or dry sand. Example 10.10 Calculate the final speed of a solid cylinder that rolls down a 2.00-m-high incline. The cylinder starts from rest, has a mass of 0.750 kg, and has a radius of 4.00 cm. We can solve for the final velocity using conservation of energy, but we must first express rotational quantities in terms of translational quantities to end up with vv as the only unknown. vv Conservation of energy for this situation is written as described above: 10.85 Before we can solve for vv , we must get an expression for II from Figure 10.11. Because vv and ωω are related (note here that the cylinder is rolling without slipping), we must also substitute the relationship ω=v/Rω=v/R into the expression. These substitutions yield vv II vv ωω ω=v/Rω=v/R 10.86 Interestingly, the cylinder’s radius RR and mass mm cancel, yielding RR mm 10.87 Solving algebraically, the equation for the final velocity

(Rolling cylinders down inclines is what Galileo actually did to show that objects fall at the same rate independent of mass.) Note that if the cylinder slid without friction down the incline without rolling, then the entire gravitational potential energy would go into translational kinetic energy. Thus, 12mv2=mgh12mv2=mgh and v=(2gh)1/2v=(2gh)1/2, which is 22% greater than (4gh/3)1/2(4gh/3)1/2.

What, if any, are their differences? Give an example of each type of kinetic energy. Analogy of Rotational and Translational Kinetic Energy Solution Yes, rotational and translational kinetic energy are exact analogs. They both are the energy of motion involved with the coordinated (non-random) movement of mass relative to some reference frame. The only difference between rotational and translational kinetic energy is that translational is straight line motion while rotational is not. An example of both kinetic and translational kinetic energy is found in a bike tire while being ridden down a bike path. The rotational motion of the tire means it has rotational kinetic energy while the movement of the bike along the path means the tire also has translational kinetic energy. If you were to lift the front wheel of the bike and spin it while the bike is stationary, then the wheel would have only rotational kinetic energy relative to the Earth."

Page 106,"We can now understand why Earth keeps on spinning. As we saw in the previous example, ΔL=(netτ)ΔtΔL=(netτ)Δt. This equation means that, to change angular momentum, a torque must act over some period of time. Because Earth has a large angular momentum, a large torque acting over a long time is needed to change its rate of spin. So what external torques are there? Tidal friction exerts torque that is slowing Earth’s rotation, but tens of millions of years must pass before the change is very significant. Recent research indicates the length of the day was 18 h some 900 million years ago. Only the tides exert significant retarding torques on Earth, and so it will continue to spin, although ever more slowly, for many billions of years.

The net torque on her is very close to zero, because there is relatively little friction between her skates and the ice and because the friction is exerted very close to the pivot point. (Both FF and rr are small, and so ττ is negligibly small.) Consequently, she can spin for quite some time. She can do something else, too. She can increase her rate of spin by pulling her arms and legs in. Why does pulling her arms and legs in increase her rate of spin? The answer is that her angular momentum is constant, so that FF rr ττ 10.112 Expressing this equation in terms of the moment of inertia, 10.113 where the primed quantities refer to conditions after she has pulled in her arms and reduced her moment of inertia. Because I′I′ is smaller, the angular velocity ω′ω′ must increase to keep the angular momentum constant. The change can be dramatic, as the following example shows. I′I′ ω′ω′ Figure 10.21 (a) An ice skater is spinning on the tip of her skate with her arms extended. Her angular momentum is conserved because the net torque on her is negligibly small. In the next image, her rate of spin increases greatly when she pulls in her arms, decreasing her moment of inertia. The work she does to pull in her arms results in an increase in rotational kinetic energy. Example 10.14 Suppose an ice skater, such as the one in Figure 10.21, is spinning at 0.800 rev/ s with her arms extended. She has a moment of inertia of 2.34kg⋅m22.34kg⋅m2 with her arms extended and of 0.363kg⋅m20.363kg⋅m2with her arms close to her body. (These moments of inertia are based on reasonable assumptions about a 60.0-kg skater.) (a) What is her angular velocity in revolutions per second after she pulls in her arms? (b) What is her rotational kinetic energy before and after she does this? 2.34kg⋅m22.34kg⋅m2 0.363kg⋅m20.363kg⋅m2 In the first part of the problem, we are looking for the skater’s angular velocity ω′ω′ after she has pulled in her arms. To find this quantity, we use the conservation of angular momentum and note that the moments of inertia and initial angular velocity are given. To find the initial and final kinetic energies, we use the definition of rotational kinetic energy given by ω′ω′ 10.114 Because torque is negligible (as discussed above), the conservation of angular momentum given in Iω=I′ω′Iω=I′ω′ is applicable. Thus, Iω=I′ω′Iω=I′ω′ 10.115 or 10.116 Solving for ω′ω′and substituting known values into the resulting equation gives ω′ω′ 10.117 Rotational kinetic energy is given by 10.118 The initial value is found by substituting known values into the equation and converting the angular velocity to rad/s: 10.119 The final rotational kinetic energy is 10.120 Substituting known values into this equation gives 10.121 In both parts, there is an impressive increase. First, the final angular velocity is large, although most world-class skaters can achieve spin rates about this great. Second, the final kinetic energy is much greater than the initial kinetic energy. The increase in rotational kinetic energy comes from work done by the skater in pulling in her arms. This work is internal work that depletes some of the skater’s food energy. There are several other examples of objects that increase their rate of spin because something reduced their moment of inertia. Tornadoes are one example. Storm systems that create tornadoes are slowly rotating. When the radius of rotation narrows, even in a local region, angular velocity increases, sometimes to the furious level of a tornado. Earth is another example. Our planet was born from a huge cloud of gas and dust, the rotation of which came from turbulence in an even larger cloud. Gravitational forces caused the cloud to contract, and the rotation rate increased as a result. (See Figure 10.22.) Figure 10.22 The Solar System coalesced from a cloud of gas and dust that was originally rotating. The orbital motions and spins of the planets are in the same direction as the original spin and conserve the angular momentum of the parent cloud. In case of human motion, one would not expect angular momentum to be conserved when a body interacts with the environment as its foot pushes off the ground. Astronauts floating in space aboard the International Space Station have no angular momentum relative to the inside of the ship if they are motionless. Their bodies will continue to have this zero value no matter how they twist about as long as they do not give themselves a push off the side of the vessel. Check Your Understanding Is angular momentum completely analogous to linear momentum? What, if any, are their differences? Solution Yes, angular and linear momentums are completely analogous. While they are exact analogs they have different units and are not directly inter-convertible like forms of energy are."

Page 107,"Suppose the disk in Figure 10.24 has a mass of 50.0 g and an initial velocity of 30.0 m/s when it strikes the stick that is 1.20 m long and 2.00 kg. (a) What is the angular velocity of the two after the collision? (b) What is the kinetic energy before and after the collision? (c) What is the total linear momentum before and after the collision? We can answer the first question using conservation of angular momentum as noted. Because angular momentum is IωIω, we can solve for angular velocity. IωIω Conservation of angular momentum states 10.122 where primed quantities stand for conditions after the collision and both momenta are calculated relative to the pivot point. The initial angular momentum of the system of stick-disk is that of the disk just before it strikes the stick. That is, 10.123 where II is the moment of inertia of the disk and ωω is its angular velocity around the pivot point. Now, I=mr2I=mr2 (taking the disk to be approximately a point mass) and ω=v/rω=v/r, so that II ωω I=mr2I=mr2 ω=v/rω=v/r 10.124 After the collision, 10.125 It is

Figure 10.11 gives the formula for a rod rotating around one end to be I=Mr2/3I=Mr2/3. Thus, I′I′ I=Mr2/3I=Mr2/3 10.128 Entering known values in this equation yields, 10.129 The value of I′I′ is now entered into the expression for
ω′ω′, which yields I′I′ ω′ω′ 10.130 The kinetic energy before the collision is the incoming disk’s translational kinetic energy, and after the collision, it is the rotational kinetic energy of the two stuck together. First, we calculate the translational kinetic energy by entering given values for the mass and speed of the incoming disk. 10.131 After the collision, the rotational kinetic energy can be found because we now know the final angular velocity and the final moment of inertia. Thus, entering the values into the rotational kinetic energy equation gives 10.132 The linear momentum before the collision is that of the disk. After the collision, it is the sum of the disk’s momentum and that of the center of mass of the stick. Before the collision, then, linear momentum is 10.133 After the collision, the disk and the stick’s center of mass move in the same direction. The total linear momentum is that of the disk moving at a new velocity v′=rω′v′=rω′ plus that of the stick’s center of mass, v′=rω′v′=rω′ which moves at half this speed because vCM=r2ω′=v′2vCM=r2ω′=v′2. Thus, vCM=r2ω′=v′2vCM=r2ω′=v′2 10.134 Gathering similar terms in the equation yields, 10.135 so that 10.136 Substituting known values into the equation, 10.137 First note that the kinetic energy is less after the collision, as predicted, because the collision is inelastic. More surprising is that the momentum after the collision is actually greater than before the collision. This result can be understood if you consider how the nail affects the stick and vice versa. Apparently, the stick pushes backward on the nail when first struck by the disk. The nail’s reaction (consistent with Newton’s third law) is to push forward on the stick, imparting momentum to it in the same direction in which the disk was initially moving, thereby increasing the momentum of the system."

Page 118,A change in pressure applied to an enclosed fluid is transmitted undiminished to all portions of the fluid and to the walls of its container.
Page 118,"One of the most important technological applications of Pascal’s principle is found in a hydraulic system, which is an enclosed fluid system used to exert forces. The most common hydraulic systems are those that operate car brakes. Let us first consider the simple hydraulic system shown in Figure 11.11. Figure 11.11 A typical hydraulic system with two fluid-filled cylinders, capped with pistons and connected by a tube called a hydraulic line. A downward force F1F1 on the left piston creates a pressure that is transmitted undiminished to all parts of the enclosed fluid. This results in an upward force F2F2 on the right piston that is larger than F1F1 because the right piston has a larger area."
Page 118,"We can derive a relationship between the forces in the simple hydraulic system shown in Figure 11.11 by applying Pascal’s principle. Note first that the two pistons in the system are at the same height, and so there will be no difference in pressure due to a difference in depth. Now the pressure due to F1F1 acting on area A1A1 is simply P1=F1A1P1=F1A1, as defined by P=FAP=FA. According to Pascal’s principle, this pressure is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluid and to all walls of the container. Thus, a pressure P2P2 is felt at the other piston that is equal to P1P1. That is P1=P2P1=P2. F1F1 A1A1 P1=F1A1P1=F1A1 P=FAP=FA P2P2 P1P1 P1=P2P1=P2 But since P2=F2A2P2=F2A2, we see that F1A1=F2A2F1A1=F2A2. P2=F2A2P2=F2A2 F1A1=F2A2F1A1=F2A2 This equation relates the ratios of force to area in any hydraulic system, providing the pistons are at the same vertical height and that friction in the system is negligible. Hydraulic systems can increase or decrease the force applied to them. To make the force larger, the pressure is applied to a larger area. For example, if a 100-N force is applied to the left cylinder in Figure 11.11 and the right one has an area five times greater, then the force out is 500 N. Hydraulic systems are analogous to simple levers, but they have the advantage that pressure can be sent through tortuously curved lines to several places at once. Example 11.6 Consider the automobile hydraulic system shown in Figure 11.12. Figure 11.12 Hydraulic brakes use Pascal’s principle. The driver exerts a force of 100 N on the brake pedal. This force is increased by the simple lever and again by the hydraulic system. Each of the identical wheel cylinders receives the same pressure and, therefore, creates the same force output F2F2. The circular cross-sectional areas of the pedal and wheel cylinders are represented by A1A1 and A2A2, respectively A force of 100 N is applied to the brake pedal, which acts on the pedal cylinder through a lever. A force of 500 N is exerted on the pedal cylinder. (The reader can verify that the force is 500 N using techniques of statics from Applications of Statics, Including Problem-Solving Strategies.) Pressure created in the pedal cylinder is transmitted to four wheel cylinders. The pedal cylinder has a diameter of 0.500 cm, and each wheel cylinder has a diameter of 2.50 cm. Calculate the force F2F2 created at each of the wheel cylinders. F2F2 We are given the force F1F1 that is applied to the pedal cylinder. The cross-sectional areas A1A1 and A2A2 can be calculated from their given diameters. Then F1A1=F2A2F1A1=F2A2 can be used to find the force F2F2. Manipulate this algebraically to get F2F2 on one side and substitute known values: F1F1 A1A1 A2A2 F1A1=F2A2F1A1=F2A2 F2F2 F2F2 Pascal’s principle applied to hydraulic systems is given by F1A1=F2A2F1A1=F2A2: F1A1=F2A2F1A1=F2A2 11.27 This value is the force exerted by each of the four wheel cylinders. Note that we can add as many wheel cylinders as we wish. If each has a 2.50-cm diameter, each will exert 1.25×104

N. A simple hydraulic system, such as a simple machine, can increase force but cannot do more work than done on it. Work is force times distance moved, and the wheel cylinder moves through a smaller distance than the pedal cylinder. Furthermore, the more wheels added, the smaller the distance each moves. Many hydraulic systems—such as power brakes and those in bulldozers—have a motorized pump that actually does most of the work in the system. The movement of the legs of a spider is achieved partly by hydraulics. Using hydraulics, a jumping spider can create a force that makes it capable of jumping 25 times its length! Making Connections: Conservation of Energy Conservation of energy applied to a hydraulic system tells us that the system cannot do more work than is done on it. Work transfers energy, and so the work output cannot exceed the work input. Power brakes and other similar hydraulic systems use pumps to supply extra energy when needed."

Page 120,The buoyant force is the net upward force on any object in any fluid.
Page 120,"Drop a lump of clay in water. It will sink. Then mold the lump of clay into the shape of a boat, and it will float. Because of its shape, the boat displaces more water than the lump and experiences a greater buoyant force. The same is true of steel ships. Example 11.8 (a) Calculate the buoyant force on 10,000 metric tons (1.00×107kg)(1.00×107kg) of solid steel completely submerged in water, and compare this with the steel’s weight. (b) What is the maximum buoyant force that water could exert on this same steel if it were shaped into a boat that could displace 1.00×105m31.00×105m3 of water? (1.00×107kg)(1.00×107kg) 1.00×105m31.00×105m3 To find the buoyant force, we must find the weight of water displaced. We can do this by using the densities of water and steel given in Table 11.1. We note that, since the steel is completely submerged, its volume and the water’s volume are the same. Once we know the volume of water, we can find its mass and weight. First, we use the definition of density ρ=mVρ=mV to find the steel’s volume, and then we substitute values for mass and density. This gives ρ=mVρ=mV 11.32 Because the steel is completely submerged, this is also the volume of water displaced, VwVw. We can now find the mass of water displaced from the relationship between its volume and density, both of which are known. This gives VwVw 11.33 By Archimedes’ principle, the weight of water displaced is mwgmwg, so the buoyant force is mwgmwg 11.34 The steel’s weight is msw=9.80×107Nmsw=9.80×107N, which is much greater than the buoyant force, so the steel will remain submerged. Note that the buoyant force is rounded to two digits because the density of steel is given to only two digits. msw=9.80×107Nmsw=9.80×107N Here we are given the maximum volume of water the steel boat can displace. The buoyant force is the weight of this volume of water. The mass of water displaced is found from its relationship to density and volume, both of which are known. That is, 11.35 The maximum buoyant force is the weight of this much water, or 11.36 The maximum buoyant force is ten times the weight of the steel, meaning the ship can carry a load nine times its own weight without sinking.

Test your prediction."
Page 120,"Density plays a crucial role in Archimedes’ principle. The average density of an object is what ultimately determines whether it floats. If its average density is less than that of the surrounding fluid, it will float. This is because the fluid, having a higher density, contains more mass and hence more weight in the same volume. The buoyant force, which equals the weight of the fluid displaced, is thus greater than the weight of the object. Likewise, an object denser than the fluid will sink. The extent to which a floating object is submerged depends on how the object’s density is related to that of the fluid. In Figure 11.20, for example, the unloaded ship has a lower density and less of it is submerged compared with the same ship loaded. We can derive a quantitative expression for the fraction submerged by considering density. The fraction submerged is the ratio of the volume submerged to the volume of the object, or 11.37 The volume submerged equals the volume of fluid displaced, which we call VflVfl. Now we can obtain the relationship between the densities by substituting ρ=mVρ=mV into the expression. This gives VflVfl ρ=mVρ=mV 11.38 where ρ¯objρ¯obj is the average density of the object and ρflρfl is the density of the fluid. Since the object floats, its mass and that of the displaced fluid are equal, and so they cancel from the equation, leaving ρ¯objρ¯obj ρflρfl 11.39 Figure 11.20 An unloaded ship (a) floats higher in the water than a loaded ship (b). We use this last relationship to measure densities. This is done by measuring the fraction of a floating object that is submerged—for example, with a hydrometer. It is useful to define the ratio of the density of an object to a fluid (usually water) as specific gravity: specific gravity 11.40 where

 is the average density of the object or substance and ρwρw is the density of water at 4.00°C. Specific gravity is dimensionless, independent of whatever units are used for ρρ. If an object floats, its specific gravity is less than one. If it sinks, its specific gravity is greater than one. Moreover, the fraction of a floating object that is submerged equals its specific gravity. If an object’s specific gravity is exactly 1, then it will remain suspended in the fluid, neither sinking nor floating. Scuba divers try to obtain this state so that they can hover in the water. We measure the specific gravity of fluids, such as battery acid, radiator fluid, and urine, as an indicator of their condition. One device for measuring specific gravity is shown in Figure 11.21. ρ

The glass hydrometer is filled with air and weighted with lead at the bottom. It floats highest in the densest fluids and has been calibrated and labeled so that specific gravity can be read from it directly. Example 11.9 Suppose a 60.0-kg woman floats in freshwater with 97.0%97.0% of her volume submerged when her lungs are full of air. What is her average density? 97.0%97.0% We can find the woman’s density by solving the equation 11.41 for the density of the object. This yields 11.42 We know both the fraction submerged and the density of water, and so we can calculate the woman’s density. Entering the known values into the expression for her density, we obtain 11.43 Her density is less than the fluid density. We expect this because she floats. Body density is one indicator of a person’s percent body fat, of interest in medical diagnostics and athletic training. (See Figure 11.22.) Figure 11.22 Subject in a hydrostatis weighing device, where they are weighed while completely submerged as part of a body density determination. The subject must completely empty their lungs and hold a metal weight in order to sink. Corrections are made for the residual air in the lungs (measured separately) and the metal weight. Their corrected submerged weight, their weight in air, and pinch tests of strategic fatty areas are used to calculate the percent body fat. There are many obvious examples of lower-density objects or substances floating in higher-density fluids—oil on water, a hot-air balloon, a bit of cork in wine, an iceberg, and hot wax in a “lava lamp,” to name a few. Less obvious examples include lava rising in a volcano and mountain ranges floating on the higher-density crust and mantle beneath them. Even seemingly solid Earth has fluid characteristics."
Page 120,"One of the most common techniques for determining density is shown in Figure 11.23. Figure 11.23 (a) A coin is weighed in air. (b) The apparent weight of the coin is determined while it is completely submerged in a fluid of known density. These two measurements are used to calculate the density of the coin. An object, here a coin, is weighed in air and then weighed again while submerged in a liquid. The density of the coin, an indication of its authenticity, can be calculated if the fluid density is known. This same technique can also be used to determine the density of the fluid if the density of the coin is known. All of these calculations are based on Archimedes’ principle. Archimedes’ principle states that the buoyant force on the object equals the weight of the fluid displaced. This, in turn, means that the object appears to weigh less when submerged; we call this measurement the object’s apparent weight. The object suffers an apparent weight loss equal to the weight of the fluid displaced. Alternatively, on balances that measure mass, the object suffers an apparent mass loss equal to the mass of fluid displaced. That is 11.44 or 11.45 The next example illustrates the use of this technique. Example 11.10 The mass of an ancient Greek coin is determined in air to be 8.630 g. When the coin is submerged in water as shown in Figure 11.23, its apparent mass is 7.800 g. Calculate its density, given that water has a density of 1.000g/cm31.000g/cm3 and that effects caused by the wire suspending the coin are negligible. 1.000g/cm31.000g/cm3 To calculate the coin’s density, we need its mass (which is given) and its volume. The volume of the coin equals the volume of water displaced. The volume of water displaced VwVw can be found by solving the equation for density ρ=mVρ=mV for VV. VwVw ρ=mVρ=mV VV The volume of water is Vw=mwρwVw=mwρw where mwmw is the mass of water displaced. As noted, the mass of the water displaced equals the apparent mass loss, which is mw=8.630 g−7.800 g=0.830 gmw=8.630 g−7.800 g=0.830 g. Thus the volume of water is Vw=0.830 g1.000 g/cm3=0.830cm3Vw=0.830 g1.000 g/cm3=0.830cm3. This is also the volume of the coin, since it is completely submerged. We can now find the density of the coin using the definition of density: Vw=mwρwVw=mwρw mwmw mw=8.630 g−7.800 g=0.830 gmw=8.630 g−7.800 g=0.830 g Vw=0.830 g1.000 g/cm3=0.830cm3Vw=0.830 g1.000 g/cm3=0.830cm3 11.46 You can see from Table 11.1 that this density is very close to that of pure silver, appropriate for this type of ancient coin. Most modern counterfeits are not pure silver. This brings us back to Archimedes’ principle and how it came into being. As the story goes, the king of Syracuse gave Archimedes the task of determining whether the royal crown maker was supplying a crown of pure gold. The purity of gold is difficult to determine by color (it can be diluted with other metals and still look as yellow as pure gold), and other analytical techniques had not yet been conceived. Even ancient peoples, however, realized that the density of gold was greater than that of any other then-known substance. Archimedes purportedly agonized over his task and had his inspiration one day while at the public baths, pondering the support the water gave his body. He came up with his now-famous principle, saw how to apply it to determine density, and ran naked down the streets of Syracuse crying “Eureka!” (Greek for “I have found it”). Similar behavior can be observed in contemporary physicists from time to time!"

All these activities are dominated by the attractive forces between atoms and molecules in liquids—both within a liquid and between the liquid and its surroundings. Attractive forces between molecules of the same type are called cohesive forces. Liquids can, for example, be held in open containers because cohesive forces hold the molecules together. Attractive forces between molecules of different types are called adhesive forces. Such forces cause liquid drops to cling to window panes, for example. In this section we examine effects directly attributable to cohesive and adhesive forces in liquids. cohesive forces adhesive forces Cohesive Forces Attractive forces between molecules of the same type are called cohesive forces.

Page 121,"Cohesive forces between molecules cause the surface of a liquid to contract to the smallest possible surface area. This general effect is called surface tension. Molecules on the surface are pulled inward by cohesive forces, reducing the surface area. Molecules inside the liquid experience zero net force, since they have neighbors on all sides. surface tension Surface Tension Cohesive forces between molecules cause the surface of a liquid to contract to the smallest possible surface area. This general effect is called surface tension. Making Connections: Surface Tension Forces between atoms and molecules underlie the macroscopic effect called surface tension. These attractive forces pull the molecules closer together and tend to minimize the surface area. This is another example of a submicroscopic explanation for a macroscopic phenomenon. The model of a liquid surface acting like a stretched elastic sheet can effectively explain surface tension effects. For example, some insects can walk on water (as opposed to floating in it) as we would walk on a trampoline—they dent the surface as shown in Figure 11.25(a). Figure 11.25(b) shows another example, where a needle rests on a water surface. The iron needle cannot, and does not, float, because its density is greater than that of water. Rather, its weight is supported by forces in the stretched surface that try to make the surface smaller or flatter. If the needle were placed point down on the surface, its weight acting on a smaller area would break the surface, and it would sink. Figure 11.25 Surface tension supporting the weight of an insect and an iron needle, both of which rest on the surface without penetrating it. They are not floating; rather, they are supported by the surface of the liquid. (a) An insect leg dents the water surface.

 is a restoring force (surface tension) parallel to the surface. (b) An iron needle similarly dents a water surface until the restoring force (surface tension) grows to equal its weight. Surface tension is proportional to the strength of the cohesive force, which varies with the type of liquid. Surface tension γγ is defined to be the force F per unit length LL exerted by a stretched liquid membrane: γγ LL 11.47 Table 11.3 lists values of γγ for some liquids. For the insect of Figure 11.25(a), its weight ww is supported by the upward components of the surface tension force: w=γLsinθw=γLsinθ, where LL is the circumference of the insect’s foot in contact with the water. Figure 11.26 shows one way to measure surface tension. The liquid film exerts a force on the movable wire in an attempt to reduce its surface area. The magnitude of this force depends on the surface tension of the liquid and can be measured accurately. γγ ww w=γLsinθw=γLsinθ LL Surface tension is the reason why liquids form bubbles and droplets. The inward surface tension force causes bubbles to be approximately spherical and raises the pressure of the gas trapped inside relative to atmospheric pressure outside. It can be shown that the gauge pressure PP    inside a spherical bubble is given by PP 11.48 where rr is the radius of the bubble. Thus the pressure inside a bubble is greatest when the bubble is the smallest. Another bit of evidence for this is illustrated in Figure 11.27. When air is allowed to flow between two balloons of unequal size, the smaller balloon tends to collapse, filling the larger balloon. rr Figure 11.26 Sliding wire device used for measuring surface tension; the device exerts a force to reduce the film’s surface area. The force needed to hold the wire in place is F=γL=γ(2l)F=γL=γ(2l), since there are two liquid surfaces attached to the wire. This force remains nearly constant as the film is stretched, until the film approaches its breaking point. Figure 11.27 With the valve closed, two balloons of different sizes are attached to each end of a tube. Upon opening the valve, the smaller balloon decreases in size with the air moving to fill the larger balloon. The pressure in a spherical balloon is inversely proportional to its radius, so that the smaller balloon has a greater internal pressure than the larger balloon, resulting in this flow. Table 11.3 Surface Tension of Some Liquids1 Example 11.11 Calculate the gauge pressure inside a soap bubble 2.00×10−4m2.00×10−4m in radius using the surface tension for soapy water in Table 11.3. Convert this pressure to mm Hg. 2.00×10−4m2.00×10−4m The radius is given and the surface tension can be found in Table 11.3, and so PP can be found directly from the equation P=4γrP=4γr. PP P=4γrP=4γr Substituting rr and γγ into the equation P=4γrP=4γr, we obtain rr γγ P=4γrP=4γr 11.49 We use a conversion factor to get this into units of mm Hg: 11.50 Note that if a hole were to be made in the bubble, the air would be forced out, the bubble would decrease in radius, and the gauge pressure would reduce to zero, and the absolute pressure inside would decrease to atmospheric pressure (760 mm Hg). Our lungs contain hundreds of millions of mucus-lined sacs called alveoli, which are very similar in size, and about 0.1 mm in diameter. (See Figure 11.28.) You can exhale without muscle action by allowing surface tension to contract these sacs. Medical patients whose breathing is aided by a positive pressure respirator have air blown into the lungs, but are generally allowed to exhale on their own. Even if there is paralysis, surface tension in the alveoli will expel air from the lungs. Since pressure increases as the radii of the alveoli decrease, an occasional deep cleansing breath is needed to fully reinflate the alveoli. Respirators are programmed to do this and we find it natural, as do our companion dogs and cats, to take a cleansing breath before settling into a nap. Figure 11.28 Bronchial tubes in the lungs branch into ever-smaller structures, finally ending in alveoli. The alveoli act like tiny bubbles. The surface tension of their mucous lining aids in exhalation and can prevent inhalation if too great. The tension in the walls of the alveoli results from the membrane tissue and a liquid on the walls of the alveoli containing a long lipoprotein that acts as a surfactant (a surface-tension reducing substance). The need for the surfactant results from the tendency of small alveoli to collapse and the air to fill into the larger alveoli making them even larger (as demonstrated in Figure 11.27). During inhalation, the lipoprotein molecules are pulled apart and the wall tension increases as the radius increases (increased surface tension). During exhalation, the molecules slide back together and the surface tension decreases, helping to prevent a collapse of the alveoli. The surfactant therefore serves to change the wall tension so that small alveoli don’t collapse and large alveoli are prevented from expanding too much. This tension change is a unique property of these surfactants, and is not shared by detergents (which simply lower surface tension). (See Figure 11.29.) Figure 11.29 Surface tension as a function of surface area. The surface tension for lung surfactant decreases with decreasing area. This ensures that small alveoli don’t collapse and large alveoli are not able to over expand. If water gets into the lungs, the surface tension is too great and you cannot inhale. This is a severe problem in resuscitating drowning victims. A similar problem occurs in newborn infants who are born without this surfactant—their lungs are very difficult to inflate. This condition is known as hyaline membrane disease and is a leading cause of death for infants, particularly in premature births. Some success has been achieved in treating hyaline membrane disease by spraying a surfactant into the infant’s breathing passages. Emphysema produces the opposite problem with alveoli. Alveolar walls of emphysema victims deteriorate, and the sacs combine to form larger sacs. Because pressure produced by surface tension decreases with increasing radius, these larger sacs produce smaller pressure, reducing the ability of emphysema victims to exhale. A common test for emphysema is to measure the pressure and volume of air that can be exhaled. Making Connections: Take-Home Investigation (1) Try floating a sewing needle on water. In order for this activity to work, the needle needs to be very clean as even the oil from your fingers can be sufficient to affect the surface properties of the needle. (2) Place the bristles of a paint brush into water. Pull the brush out and notice that for a short while, the bristles will stick together. The surface tension of the water surrounding the bristles is sufficient to hold the bristles together. As the bristles dry out, the surface tension effect dissipates. (3) Place a loop of thread on the surface of still water in such a way that all of the thread is in contact with the water. Note the shape of the loop. Now place a drop of detergent into the middle of the loop. What happens to the shape of the loop? Why? (4) Sprinkle pepper onto the surface of water. Add a drop of detergent. What happens? Why? (5) Float two matches parallel to each other and add a drop of detergent between them. What happens? Note: For each new experiment, the water needs to be replaced and the bowl washed to free it of any residual detergent."
Page 121,"Why is it that water beads up on a waxed car but does not on bare paint? The answer is that the adhesive forces between water and wax are much smaller than those between water and paint. Competition between the forces of adhesion and cohesion are important in the macroscopic behavior of liquids. An important factor in studying the roles of these two forces is the angle θθ between the tangent to the liquid surface and the surface. (See Figure 11.30.) The contact angle θθ is directly related to the relative strength of the cohesive and adhesive forces. The larger the strength of the cohesive force relative to the adhesive force, the larger θθ is, and the more the liquid tends to form a droplet. The smaller θθ is, the smaller the relative strength, so that the adhesive force is able to flatten the drop. Table 11.4 lists contact angles for several combinations of liquids and solids. θθ contact angle θθ θθ θθ Contact Angle The angle θθ between the tangent to the liquid surface and the surface is called the contact angle. θθ Figure 11.30 In the photograph, water beads on the waxed car paint and flattens on the unwaxed paint. (a) Water forms beads on the waxed surface because the cohesive forces responsible for surface tension are larger than the adhesive forces, which tend to flatten the drop. (b) Water beads on bare paint are flattened considerably because the adhesive forces between water and paint are strong, overcoming surface tension. The contact angle θθ is directly related to the relative strengths of the cohesive and adhesive forces. The larger θθ is, the larger the ratio of cohesive to adhesive forces. (credit: P. P. Urone) One important phenomenon related to the relative strength of cohesive and adhesive forces is capillary action—the tendency of a fluid to be raised or suppressed in a narrow tube, or capillary tube. This action causes blood to be drawn into a small-diameter tube when the tube touches a drop. capillary action Capillary Action The tendency of a fluid to be raised or suppressed in a narrow tube, or capillary tube, is called capillary action. If a capillary tube is placed vertically into a liquid, as shown in Figure 11.31, capillary action will raise or suppress the liquid inside the tube depending on the combination of substances. The actual effect depends on the relative strength of the cohesive and adhesive forces and, thus, the contact angle θθ given in the table. If θθ is less than 90º90º, then the fluid will be raised; if θθ is greater than 90º90º, it will be suppressed. Mercury, for example, has a very large surface tension and a large contact angle with glass. When placed in a tube, the surface of a column of mercury curves downward, somewhat like a drop. The curved surface of a fluid in a tube is called a meniscus. The tendency of surface tension is always to reduce the surface area. Surface tension thus flattens the curved liquid surface in a capillary tube. This results in a downward force in mercury and an upward force in water, as seen in Figure 11.31. θθ θθ 90º90º θθ 90º90º Figure 11.31 (a) Mercury is suppressed in a glass tube because its contact angle is greater than 90º90º. Surface tension exerts a downward force as it flattens the mercury, suppressing it in the tube. The dashed line shows the shape the mercury surface would have without the flattening effect of surface tension. (b) Water is raised in a glass tube because its contact angle is nearly 0º0º. Surface tension therefore exerts an upward force when it flattens the surface to reduce its area. Table 11.4 Contact Angles of Some Substances Capillary action can move liquids horizontally over very large distances, but the height to which it can raise or suppress a liquid in a tube is limited by its weight. It can be shown that this height hh is given by hh 11.51 If we look at the different factors in this expression, we might see how it makes good sense. The height is directly proportional to the surface tension γγ, which is its direct cause. Furthermore, the height is inversely proportional to tube radius—the smaller the radius rr, the higher the fluid can be raised, since a smaller tube holds less mass. The height is also inversely proportional to fluid density ρρ, since a larger density means a greater mass in the same volume. (See Figure 11.32.) γγ rr ρρ Figure 11.32 (a) Capillary action depends on the radius of a tube. The smaller the tube, the greater the height reached. The height is negligible for large-radius tubes. (b) A denser fluid in the same tube rises to a smaller height, all other factors being the same. Example 11.12 Can capillary action be solely responsible for sap rising in trees? To answer this question, calculate the radius of a capillary tube that would raise sap 100 m to the top of a giant redwood, assuming that sap’s density is 1050 kg/m31050 kg/m3, its contact angle is zero, and its surface tension is the same as that of water at 20.0º C20.0º C. 1050 kg/m31050 kg/m3 20.0º C20.0º C The height to which a liquid will rise as a result of capillary action is given by h=2γ cosθρgrh=2γ cosθρgr, and every quantity is known except for rr. h=2γ cosθρgrh=2γ cosθρgr rr Solving for rr and substituting known values produces rr 11.52 This result is unreasonable. Sap in trees moves through the xylem, which forms tubes with radii as small as 2.5×10−5m2.5×10−5m. This value is about 180 times as large as the radius found necessary here to raise sap 100 m100 m. This means that capillary action alone cannot be solely responsible for sap getting to the tops of trees. 2.5×10−5m2.5×10−5m 100 m100 m How does sap get to the tops of tall trees? (Recall that a column of water can only rise to a height of 10 m  when there is a vacuum at the top—see Example 11.5.) The question has not been completely resolved, but it appears that it is pulled up like a chain held together by cohesive forces. As each molecule of sap enters a leaf and evaporates (a process called transpiration), the entire chain is pulled up a notch. So a negative pressure created by water evaporation must be present to pull the sap up through the xylem vessels. In most situations, fluids can push but can exert only negligible pull, because the cohesive forces seem to be too small to hold the molecules tightly together. But in this case, the cohesive force of water molecules provides a very strong pull. Figure 11.33 shows one device for studying negative pressure. Some experiments have demonstrated that negative pressures sufficient to pull sap to the tops of the tallest trees can be achieved. Figure 11.33 (a) When the piston is raised, it stretches the liquid slightly, putting it under tension and creating a negative absolute pressure P=−F/AP=−F/A. (b) The liquid eventually separates, giving an experimental limit to negative pressure in this liquid."

Page 122,"Next to taking a person’s temperature and weight, measuring blood pressure is the most common of all medical examinations. Control of high blood pressure is largely responsible for the significant decreases in heart attack and stroke fatalities achieved in the last three decades. The pressures in various parts of the body can be measured and often provide valuable medical indicators. In this section, we consider a few examples together with some of the physics that accompanies them. Table 11.5 lists some of the measured pressures in mm Hg, the units most commonly quoted. Table 11.5 Typical Pressures in Humans"
Page 122,"Common arterial blood pressure measurements typically produce values of 120 mm Hg and 80 mm Hg, respectively, for systolic and diastolic pressures. Both pressures have health implications. When systolic pressure is chronically high, the risk of stroke and heart attack is increased. If, however, it is too low, fainting is a problem. Systolic pressure increases dramatically during exercise to increase blood flow and returns to normal afterward. This change produces no ill effects and, in fact, may be beneficial to the tone of the circulatory system. Diastolic pressure can be an indicator of fluid balance. When low, it may indicate that a person is hemorrhaging internally and needs a transfusion. Conversely, high diastolic pressure indicates a ballooning of the blood vessels, which may be due to the transfusion of too much fluid into the circulatory system. High diastolic pressure is also an indication that blood vessels are not dilating properly to pass blood through. This can seriously strain the heart in its attempt to pump blood. Systolic pressure Diastolic pressure Blood leaves the heart at about 120 mm Hg but its pressure continues to decrease (to almost 0) as it goes from the aorta to smaller arteries to small veins (see Figure 11.34). The pressure differences in the circulation system are caused by blood flow through the system as well as the position of the person. For a person standing up, the pressure in the feet will be larger than at the heart due to the weight of the blood (P=hρg)(P=hρg). If we assume that the distance between the heart and the feet of a person in an upright position is 1.4 m, then the increase in pressure in the feet relative to that in the heart (for a static column of blood) is given by (P=hρg)(P=hρg) 11.53 Increase in Pressure in the Feet of a Person 11.54 Standing a long time can lead to an accumulation of blood in the legs and swelling. This is the reason why soldiers who are required to stand still for long periods of time have been known to faint. Elastic bandages around the calf can help prevent this accumulation and can also help provide increased pressure to enable the veins to send blood back up to the heart. For similar reasons, doctors recommend tight stockings for long-haul flights. Blood pressure may also be measured in the major veins, the heart chambers, arteries to the brain, and the lungs. But these pressures are usually only monitored during surgery or for patients in intensive care since the measurements are invasive. To obtain these pressure measurements, qualified health care workers thread thin tubes, called catheters, into appropriate locations to transmit pressures to external measuring devices. The heart consists of two pumps—the right side forcing blood through the lungs and the left causing blood to flow through the rest of the body (Figure 11.34). Right-heart failure, for example, results in a rise in the pressure in the vena cavae and a drop in pressure in the arteries to the lungs. Left-heart failure results in a rise in the pressure entering the left side of the heart and a drop in aortal pressure. Implications of these and other pressures on flow in the circulatory system will be discussed in more detail in Fluid Dynamics and Its Biological and Medical Applications. Two Pumps of the Heart The heart consists of two pumps—the right side forcing blood through the lungs and the left causing blood to flow through the rest of the body. Figure 11.34 Schematic of the circulatory system showing typical pressures. The two pumps in the heart increase pressure and that pressure is reduced as the blood flows through the body. Long-term deviations from these pressures have medical implications discussed in some detail in the Fluid Dynamics and Its Biological and Medical Applications. Only aortal or arterial blood pressure can be measured noninvasively."

Page 122,"The shape of the eye is maintained by fluid pressure, called intraocular pressure, which is normally in the range of 12.0 to 24.0 mm Hg. When the circulation of fluid in the eye is blocked, it can lead to a buildup in pressure, a condition called glaucoma. The net pressure can become as great as 85.0 mm Hg, an abnormally large pressure that can permanently damage the optic nerve.

When the circulation of fluid in the eye is blocked, it can lead to a buildup in pressure, a condition called glaucoma. The force is calculated as 11.56 This force is the weight of about a 680-g mass. A mass of 680 g resting on the eye (imagine 1.5 lb resting on your eye) would be sufficient to cause it damage. (A normal force here would be the weight of about 120 g, less than one-quarter of our initial value.) People over 40 years of age are at greatest risk of developing glaucoma and should have their intraocular pressure tested routinely. Most measurements involve exerting a force on the (anesthetized) eye over some area (a pressure) and observing the eye’s response. A noncontact approach uses a puff of air and a measurement is made of the force needed to indent the eye (Figure 11.35). If the intraocular pressure is high, the eye will deform less and rebound more vigorously than normal. Excessive intraocular pressures can be detected reliably and sometimes controlled effectively. Figure 11.35 The intraocular eye pressure can be read with a tonometer. (credit: DevelopAll at the Wikipedia Project.) Example 11.13 Suppose a 3.00-N force can rupture an eardrum.

(b) At what depth in freshwater would this person’s eardrum rupture, assuming the gauge pressure in the middle ear is zero? 1.00cm21.00cm2 The pressure can be found directly from its definition since we know the force and area. We are looking for the gauge pressure. 11.57 We now need to convert this to units of mm Hg: 11.58 Here we will use the fact that the water pressure varies linearly with depth hh below the surface. hh P=hρgP=hρg and therefore h=P/ρgh=P/ρg. Using the value above for PP, we have P=hρgP=hρg h=P/ρgh=P/ρg PP 11.59 Similarly, increased pressure exerted upon the eardrum from the middle ear can arise when an infection causes a fluid buildup."
Page 122,"The pressure inside the lungs increases and decreases with each breath. The pressure drops to below atmospheric pressure (negative gauge pressure) when you inhale, causing air to flow into the lungs. It increases above atmospheric pressure (positive gauge pressure) when you exhale, forcing air out. Lung pressure is controlled by several mechanisms. Muscle action in the diaphragm and rib cage is necessary for inhalation; this muscle action increases the volume of the lungs thereby reducing the pressure within them Figure 11.36. Surface tension in the alveoli creates a positive pressure opposing inhalation. (See Cohesion and Adhesion in Liquids: Surface Tension and Capillary Action.) You can exhale without muscle action by letting surface tension in the alveoli create its own positive pressure. Muscle action can add to this positive pressure to produce forced exhalation, such as when you blow up a balloon, blow out a candle, or cough. The lungs, in fact, would collapse due to the surface tension in the alveoli, if they were not attached to the inside of the chest wall by liquid adhesion. The gauge pressure in the liquid attaching the lungs to the inside of the chest wall is thus negative, ranging from −4−4 to −8 mm Hg−8 mm Hg during exhalation and inhalation, respectively. If air is allowed to enter the chest cavity, it breaks the attachment, and one or both lungs may collapse. Suction is applied to the chest cavity of surgery patients and trauma victims to reestablish negative pressure and inflate the lungs. −4−4 −8 mm Hg−8 mm Hg Figure 11.36 (a) During inhalation, muscles expand the chest, and the diaphragm moves downward, reducing pressure inside the lungs to less than atmospheric (negative gauge pressure). Pressure between the lungs and chest wall is even lower to overcome the positive pressure created by surface tension in the lungs. (b) During gentle exhalation, the muscles simply relax and surface tension in the alveoli creates a positive pressure inside the lungs, forcing air out. Pressure between the chest wall and lungs remains negative to keep them attached to the chest wall, but it is less negative than during inhalation."
Page 122,"Normally, there is a 5- to12-mm Hg pressure in the fluid surrounding the brain and filling the spinal column. This cerebrospinal fluid serves many purposes, one of which is to supply flotation to the brain. The buoyant force supplied by the fluid nearly equals the weight of the brain, since their densities are nearly equal. If there is a loss of fluid, the brain rests on the inside of the skull, causing severe headaches, constricted blood flow, and serious damage. Spinal fluid pressure is measured by means of a needle inserted between vertebrae that transmits the pressure to a suitable measuring device. This bodily pressure is one of which we are often aware. In fact, there is a relationship between our awareness of this pressure and a subsequent increase in it. Bladder pressure climbs steadily from zero to about 25 mm Hg as the bladder fills to its normal capacity of 500cm3500cm3. This pressure triggers the micturition reflex, which stimulates the feeling of needing to urinate. What is more, it also causes muscles around the bladder to contract, raising the pressure to over 100 mm Hg, accentuating the sensation.

This pressure can damage both the spinal discs (the cartilage between vertebrae), as well as the bony vertebrae themselves.

Most causes of excessive pressure in the skeletal system can be avoided by lifting properly and avoiding extreme physical activity.

For example, pressure caused by various muscle actions drives food and waste through the digestive system. Stomach pressure behaves much like bladder pressure and is tied to the sensation of hunger. Pressure in the relaxed esophagus is normally negative because pressure in the chest cavity is normally negative. Positive pressure in the stomach may thus force acid into the esophagus, causing “heartburn.” Pressure in the middle ear can result in significant force on the eardrum if it differs greatly from atmospheric pressure, such as while scuba diving. The decrease in external pressure is also noticeable during plane flights (due to a decrease in the weight of air above relative to that at the Earth’s surface). The Eustachian tubes connect the middle ear to the throat and allow us to equalize pressure in the middle ear to avoid an imbalance of force on the eardrum. Many pressures in the human body are associated with the flow of fluids. Fluid flow will be discussed in detail in the Fluid Dynamics and Its Biological and Medical Applications."

Positive pressure in the stomach may thus force acid into the esophagus, causing “heartburn.” Pressure in the middle ear can result in significant force on the eardrum if it differs greatly from atmospheric pressure, such as while scuba diving. The decrease in external pressure is also noticeable during plane flights (due to a decrease in the weight of air above relative to that at the Earth’s surface). The Eustachian tubes connect the middle ear to the throat and allow us to equalize pressure in the middle ear to avoid an imbalance of force on the eardrum. Many pressures in the human body are associated with the flow of fluids. Fluid flow will be discussed in detail in the Fluid Dynamics and Its Biological and Medical Applications."

Page 129,"The relationship between pressure and velocity in fluids is described quantitatively by Bernoulli’s equation, named after its discoverer, the Swiss scientist Daniel Bernoulli (1700–1782). Bernoulli’s equation states that for an incompressible, frictionless fluid, the following sum is constant: Bernoulli’s equation 12.17 where PP is the absolute pressure, ρρ is the fluid density, vv is the velocity of the fluid, hh is the height above some reference point, and gg is the acceleration due to gravity. If we follow a small volume of fluid along its path, various quantities in the sum may change, but the total remains constant. Let the subscripts 1 and 2 refer to any two points along the path that the bit of fluid follows; Bernoulli’s equation becomes PP ρρ vv hh gg 12.18 Bernoulli’s equation is a form of the conservation of energy principle. Note that the second and third terms are the kinetic and potential energy with mm replaced by ρρ. In fact, each term in the equation has units of energy per unit volume. We can prove this for the second term by substituting ρ=m/Vρ=m/V  into it and gathering terms: mm ρρ ρ=m/Vρ=m/V 12.19 So 12ρv212ρv2 is the kinetic energy per unit volume. Making the same substitution into the third term in the equation, we find 12ρv212ρv2 12.20 so ρ ghρ gh is the gravitational potential energy per unit volume. Note that pressure PP has units of energy per unit volume, too. Since P=F/AP=F/A, its units are N/m2N/m2. If we multiply these by m/m, we obtain N⋅m/m3=J/m3N⋅m/m3=J/m3, or energy per unit volume. Bernoulli’s equation is, in fact, just a convenient statement of conservation of energy for an incompressible fluid in the absence of friction. ρ ghρ gh PP P=F/AP=F/A N/m2N/m2 N⋅m/m3=J/m3N⋅m/m3=J/m3 Making Connections: Conservation of Energy Conservation of energy applied to fluid flow produces Bernoulli’s equation. The net work done by the fluid’s pressure results in changes in the fluid’s KEKE and PEgPEg per unit volume. If other forms of energy are involved in fluid flow, Bernoulli’s equation can be modified to take these forms into account. Such forms of energy include thermal energy dissipated because of fluid viscosity. KEKE PEgPEg The general form of Bernoulli’s equation has three terms in it, and it is broadly applicable. To understand it better, we will look at a number of specific situations that simplify and illustrate its use and meaning."
Page 129,"Let us first consider the very simple situation where the fluid is static—that is, v1=v2=0v1=v2=0. Bernoulli’s equation in that case is v1=v2=0v1=v2=0 12.21 We can further simplify the equation by taking h2=0h2=0 (we can always choose some height to be zero, just as we often have done for other situations involving the gravitational force, and take all other heights to be relative to this). In that case, we get h2=0h2=0 12.22 This equation tells us that, in static fluids, pressure increases with depth. As we go from point 1 to point 2 in the fluid, the depth increases by h1h1, and consequently, P2P2 is greater than P1P1 by an amount ρgh1ρgh1. In the very simplest case,

P1P1 is zero at the top of the fluid, and we get the familiar relationship

P=ρghP=ρgh. (Recall that

P=ρghP=ρgh and

ΔPEg=mgh.ΔPEg=mgh.) Bernoulli’s equation includes the fact that the pressure due to the weight of a fluid is

ρghρgh. Although we introduce Bernoulli’s equation for fluid flow, it includes much of what we studied for static fluids in the preceding chapter. h1h1 P2P2 P1P1 ρgh1ρgh1 P1P1 P=ρghP=ρgh P=ρghP=ρgh ΔPEg=mgh.ΔPEg=mgh. ρghρgh"
Page 129,"Another important situation is one in which the fluid moves but its depth is constant—that is, h1=h2h1=h2. Under that condition, Bernoulli’s equation becomes h1=h2h1=h2 12.23 Situations in which fluid flows at a constant depth are so important that this equation is often called Bernoulli’s principle. It is Bernoulli’s equation for fluids at constant depth. (Note again that this applies to a small volume of fluid as we follow it along its path.) As we have just discussed, pressure drops as speed increases in a moving fluid. We can see this from Bernoulli’s principle. For example, if v2v2 is greater than v1v1 in the equation, then P2P2 must be less than P1P1 for the equality to hold. Bernoulli’s principle v2v2 v1v1 P2P2 P1P1 Example 12.4 In Example 12.2, we found that the speed of water in a hose increased from 1.96 m/s to 25.5 m/s going from the hose to the nozzle. Calculate the pressure in the hose, given that the absolute pressure in the nozzle is 1.01×105N/m21.01×105N/m2 (atmospheric, as it must be) and assuming level, frictionless flow. 1.01×105N/m21.01×105N/m2 Level flow means constant depth, so Bernoulli’s principle applies. We use the subscript 1 for values in the hose and 2 for those in the nozzle. We are thus asked to find P1P1. P1P1 Solving Bernoulli’s principle for P1P1 yields P1P1 12.24 Substituting known values, 12.25 This absolute pressure in the hose is greater than in the nozzle, as expected since 
v
v is greater in the nozzle. The pressure P2P2 in the nozzle must be atmospheric since it emerges into the atmosphere without other changes in conditions. v

Page 129,"There are a number of devices and situations in which fluid flows at a constant height and, thus, can be analyzed with Bernoulli’s principle. People have long put the Bernoulli principle to work by using reduced pressure in high-velocity fluids to move things about. With a higher pressure on the outside, the high-velocity fluid forces other fluids into the stream. This process is called entrainment. Entrainment devices have been in use since ancient times, particularly as pumps to raise water small heights, as in draining swamps, fields, or other low-lying areas. Some other devices that use the concept of entrainment are shown in Figure 12.5. Figure 12.5 Examples of entrainment devices that use increased fluid speed to create low pressures, which then entrain one fluid into another. (a) A Bunsen burner uses an adjustable gas nozzle, entraining air for proper combustion. (b) An atomizer uses a squeeze bulb to create a jet of air that entrains drops of perfume. Paint sprayers and carburetors use very similar techniques to move their respective liquids. (c) A common aspirator uses a high-speed stream of water to create a region of lower pressure. Aspirators may be used as suction pumps in dental and surgical situations or for draining a flooded basement or producing a reduced pressure in a vessel. (d) The chimney of a water heater is designed to entrain air into the pipe leading through the ceiling. The airplane wing is a beautiful example of Bernoulli’s principle in action. Figure 12.6(a) shows the characteristic shape of a wing. The wing is tilted upward at a small angle and the upper surface is longer, causing air to flow faster over it. The pressure on top of the wing is therefore reduced, creating a net upward force or lift. (Wings can also gain lift by pushing air downward, utilizing the conservation of momentum principle. The deflected air molecules result in an upward force on the wing — Newton’s third law.) Sails also have the characteristic shape of a wing. (See Figure 12.6(b).) The pressure on the front side of the sail, PfrontPfront, is lower than the pressure on the back of the sail, PbackPback. This results in a forward force and even allows you to sail into the wind.

Page 130,"Figure 12.8 shows water gushing from a large tube through a dam. What is its speed as it emerges? Interestingly, if resistance is negligible, the speed is just what it would be if the water fell a distance hh from the surface of the reservoir; the water’s speed is independent of the size of the opening. Let us check this out. Bernoulli’s equation must be used since the depth is not constant. We consider water flowing from the surface (point 1) to the tube’s outlet (point 2). Bernoulli’s equation as stated in previously is hh 12.29 Both P1P1 and P2P2 equal atmospheric pressure (P1P1 is atmospheric pressure because it is the pressure at the top of the reservoir. P2P2 must be atmospheric pressure, since the emerging water is surrounded by the atmosphere and cannot have a pressure different from atmospheric pressure.) and subtract out of the equation, leaving P1P1 P2P2 P1P1 P2P2 12.30 Solving this equation for v22v22, noting that the density

ρ 12.31 We let h=h1−h2h=h1−h2; the equation then becomes h=h1−h2h=h1−h2 12.32 where hh is the height dropped by the water. This is simply a kinematic equation for any object falling a distance hh with negligible resistance. In fluids, this last equation is called Torricelli’s theorem. Note that the result is independent of the velocity’s direction, just as we found when applying conservation of energy to falling objects. hh hh Figure 12.8 (a) Water gushes from the base of the Studen Kladenetz dam in Bulgaria. (credit: Kiril Kapustin; http://www.ImagesFromBulgaria.com) (b) In the absence of significant resistance, water flows from the reservoir with the same speed it would have if it fell the distance hh without friction. This is an example of Torricelli’s theorem. Figure 12.9 Pressure in the nozzle of this fire hose is less than at ground level for two reasons: the water has to go uphill to get to the nozzle, and speed increases in the nozzle. In spite of its lowered pressure, the water can exert a large force on anything it strikes, by virtue of its kinetic energy. Pressure in the water stream becomes equal to atmospheric pressure once it emerges into the air. All preceding applications of Bernoulli’s equation involved simplifying conditions, such as constant height or constant pressure. The next example is a more general application of Bernoulli’s equation in which pressure, velocity, and height all change. (See Figure 12.9.) Example 12.5 Fire hoses used in major structure fires have inside diameters of 6.40 cm. Suppose such a hose carries a flow of 40.0 L/s starting at a gauge pressure of 1.62×106N/m21.62×106N/m2.

Page 130,"Power is the rate at which work is done or energy in any form is used or supplied. To see the relationship of power to fluid flow, consider Bernoulli’s equation: 12.38 All three terms have units of energy per unit volume, as discussed in the previous section. Now, considering units, if we multiply energy per unit volume by flow rate (volume per unit time), we get units of power. That is, (E/V)(V/t)=E/t(E/V)(V/t)=E/t. This means that if we multiply Bernoulli’s equation by flow rate QQ, we get power. In equation form, this is (E/V)(V/t)=E/t(E/V)(V/t)=E/t QQ 12.39 Each term has a clear physical meaning. For example, PQPQ is the power supplied to a fluid, perhaps by a pump, to give it its pressure PP. Similarly, 12ρv2Q12ρv2Q is the power supplied to a fluid to give it its kinetic energy. And ρghQρghQ is the power going to gravitational potential energy. PQPQ PP 12ρv2Q12ρv2Q ρghQρghQ Making Connections: Power Power is defined as the rate of energy transferred, or E/tE/t. Fluid flow involves several types of power. Each type of power is identified with a specific type of energy being expended or changed in form. E/tE/t Example 12.6 Suppose the fire hose in the previous example is fed by a pump that receives water through a hose with a 6.40-cm diameter coming from a hydrant with a pressure of 0.700×106N/m20.700×106N/m2. What power does the pump supply to the water? 0.700×106N/m20.700×106N/m2 Here we must consider energy forms as well as how they relate to fluid flow. Since the input and output hoses have the same diameters and are at the same height, the pump does not change the speed of the water nor its height, and so the water’s kinetic energy and gravitational potential energy are unchanged. That means the pump only supplies power to increase water pressure by 0.92×106N/m20.92×106N/m2 (from 0.700×106N/m20.700×106N/m2 to 1.62×106N/m21.62×106N/m2). 0.92×106N/m20.92×106N/m2 0.700×106N/m20.700×106N/m2 1.62×106N/m21.62×106N/m2 As discussed above, the power associated with pressure is 12.40 Such a substantial amount of power requires a large pump, such as is found on some fire trucks. (This kilowatt value converts to about 50 hp.) The pump in this example increases only the water’s pressure. If a pump—such as the heart—directly increases velocity and height as well as pressure, we would have to calculate all three terms to find the power it supplies."

Page 131,"When you pour yourself a glass of juice, the liquid flows freely and quickly. But when you pour syrup on your pancakes, that liquid flows slowly and sticks to the pitcher. The difference is fluid friction, both within the fluid itself and between the fluid and its surroundings. We call this property of fluids viscosity. Juice has low viscosity, whereas syrup has high viscosity. In the previous sections we have considered ideal fluids with little or no viscosity. In this section, we will investigate what factors, including viscosity, affect the rate of fluid flow. The precise definition of viscosity is based on laminar, or nonturbulent, flow. Before we can define viscosity, then, we need to define laminar flow and turbulent flow. Figure 12.10 shows both types of flow. Laminar flow is characterized by the smooth flow of the fluid in layers that do not mix. Turbulent flow, or turbulence, is characterized by eddies and swirls that mix layers of fluid together. Laminar turbulence Figure 12.10 Smoke rises smoothly for a while and then begins to form swirls and eddies. The smooth flow is called laminar flow, whereas the swirls and eddies typify turbulent flow. If you watch the smoke (being careful not to breathe on it), you will notice that it rises more rapidly when flowing smoothly than after it becomes turbulent, implying that turbulence poses more resistance to flow. (credit: Creativity103) Figure 12.11 shows schematically how laminar and turbulent flow differ. Layers flow without mixing when flow is laminar. When there is turbulence, the layers mix, and there are significant velocities in directions other than the overall direction of flow. The lines that are shown in many illustrations are the paths followed by small volumes of fluids. These are called streamlines. Streamlines are smooth and continuous when flow is laminar, but break up and mix when flow is turbulent. Turbulence has two main causes. First, any obstruction or sharp corner, such as in a faucet, creates turbulence by imparting velocities perpendicular to the flow. Second, high speeds cause turbulence. The drag both between adjacent layers of fluid and between the fluid and its surroundings forms swirls and eddies, if the speed is great enough. We shall concentrate on laminar flow for the remainder of this section, leaving certain aspects of turbulence for later sections. Figure 12.11 (a) Laminar flow occurs in layers without mixing. Notice that viscosity causes drag between layers as well as with the fixed surface. (b) An obstruction in the vessel produces turbulence. Turbulent flow mixes the fluid. There is more interaction, greater heating, and more resistance than in laminar flow. Making Connections: Take-Home Experiment: Go Down to the River Try dropping simultaneously two sticks into a flowing river, one near the edge of the river and one near the middle. Which one travels faster? Why? Figure 12.12 shows how viscosity is measured for a fluid. Two parallel plates have the specific fluid between them. The bottom plate is held fixed, while the top plate is moved to the right, dragging fluid with it. The layer (or lamina) of fluid in contact with either plate does not move relative to the plate, and so the top layer moves at vv while the bottom layer remains at rest. Each successive layer from the top down exerts a force on the one below it, trying to drag it along, producing a continuous variation in speed from vv to 0 as shown. Care is taken to insure that the flow is laminar; that is, the layers do not mix. The motion in Figure 12.12 is like a continuous shearing motion. Fluids have zero shear strength, but the rate at which they are sheared is related to the same geometrical factors AA and LL as is shear deformation for solids. vv vv AA LL Figure 12.12 The graphic shows laminar flow of fluid between two plates of area AA. The bottom plate is fixed. When the top plate is pushed to the right, it drags the fluid along with it. A force FF is required to keep the top plate in Figure 12.12 moving at a constant velocity vv, and experiments have shown that this force depends on four factors. First, FF is directly proportional to vv (until the speed is so high that turbulence occurs—then a much larger force is needed, and it has a more complicated dependence on vv). Second, FF is proportional to the area AA of the plate. This relationship seems reasonable, since AA is directly proportional to the amount of fluid being moved. Third, FF is inversely proportional to the distance between the plates LL. This relationship is also reasonable; LL is like a lever arm, and the greater the lever arm, the less force that is needed. Fourth, FF is directly proportional to the coefficient of viscosity, ηη. The greater the viscosity, the greater the force required. These dependencies are combined into the equation FF vv FF vv vv FF AA AA FF LL LL FF ηη 12.41 which gives us a working definition of fluid viscosity ηη. Solving for ηη gives viscosity ηη ηη 12.42 which defines viscosity in terms of how it is measured. The SI unit of viscosity is N⋅m/[(m/s)m2]=(N/m2)s or Pa⋅sN⋅m/[(m/s)m2]=(N/m2)s or Pa⋅s. Table 12.1 lists the coefficients of viscosity for various fluids. N⋅m/[(m/s)m2]=(N/m2)s or Pa⋅sN⋅m/[(m/s)m2]=(N/m2)s or Pa⋅s Viscosity varies from one fluid to another by several orders of magnitude. As you might expect, the viscosities of gases are much less than those of liquids, and these viscosities are often temperature dependent. The viscosity of blood can be reduced by aspirin consumption, allowing it to flow more easily around the body. (When used over the long term in low doses, aspirin can help prevent heart attacks, and reduce the risk of blood clotting.)"
Page 131,"Try dropping simultaneously two sticks into a flowing river, one near the edge of the river and one near the middle. Which one travels faster? Why?"
Page 131,"What causes flow? The answer, not surprisingly, is pressure difference. In fact, there is a very simple relationship between horizontal flow and pressure. Flow rate QQ is in the direction from high to low pressure. The greater the pressure differential between two points, the greater the flow rate. This relationship can be stated as QQ 12.43 where P1P1 and P2P2 are the pressures at two points, such as at either end of a tube, and RR is the resistance to flow. The resistance RR includes everything, except pressure, that affects flow rate. For example, RR is greater for a long tube than for a short one. The greater the viscosity of a fluid, the greater the value of RR. Turbulence greatly increases RR, whereas increasing the diameter of a tube decreases RR. P1P1 P2P2 RR RR RR RR RR RR If viscosity is zero, the fluid is frictionless and the resistance to flow is also zero. Comparing frictionless flow in a tube to viscous flow, as in Figure 12.13, we see that for a viscous fluid, speed is greatest at midstream because of drag at the boundaries. We can see the effect of viscosity in a Bunsen burner flame, even though the viscosity of natural gas is small. The resistance RR to laminar flow of an incompressible fluid having viscosity ηη through a horizontal tube of uniform radius rr and length ll, such as the one in Figure 12.14, is given by RR ηη rr ll 12.44 This equation is called Poiseuille’s law for resistance after the French scientist J. L. Poiseuille (1799–1869), who derived it in an attempt to understand the flow of blood, an often turbulent fluid. Poiseuille’s law for resistance Figure 12.13 (a) If fluid flow in a tube has negligible resistance, the speed is the same all across the tube. (b) When a viscous fluid flows through a tube, its speed at the walls is zero, increasing steadily to its maximum at the center of the tube. (c) The shape of the Bunsen burner flame is due to the velocity profile across the tube. (credit: Jason Woodhead) Let us examine Poiseuille’s expression for RR to see if it makes good intuitive sense. We see that resistance is directly proportional to both fluid viscosity ηη and the length ll of a tube. After all, both of these directly affect the amount of friction encountered—the greater either is, the greater the resistance and the smaller the flow. The radius rr of a tube affects the resistance, which again makes sense, because the greater the radius, the greater the flow (all other factors remaining the same). But it is surprising that rr is raised to the fourth power in Poiseuille’s law. This exponent means that any change in the radius of a tube has a very large effect on resistance. For example, doubling the radius of a tube decreases resistance by a factor of 24=1624=16. RR ηη ll rr rr 24=1624=16 Taken together, Q=P2−P1RQ=P2−P1R and R=8ηlπr4R=8ηlπr4 give the following expression for flow rate: Q=P2−P1RQ=P2−P1R R=8ηlπr4R=8ηlπr4 12.45 This equation describes laminar flow through a tube. It is sometimes called Poiseuille’s law for laminar flow, or simply Poiseuille’s law. Poiseuille’s law Example 12.7 Suppose the flow rate of blood in a coronary artery has been reduced to half its normal value by plaque deposits. By what factor has the radius of the artery been reduced, assuming no turbulence occurs? Assuming laminar flow, Poiseuille’s law states that 12.46 We need to compare the artery radius before and after the flow rate reduction. With a constant pressure difference assumed and the same length and viscosity, along the artery we have 12.47 So, given that Q2=0.5Q1Q2=0.5Q1, we find that r24=0.5r14r24=0.5r14. Q2=0.5Q1Q2=0.5Q1 r24=0.5r14r24=0.5r14 Therefore, r2=0.50.25r1=0.841r1r2=0.50.25r1=0.841r1, a decrease in the artery radius of 16%. r2=0.50.25r1=0.841r1r2=0.50.25r1=0.841r1 This decrease in radius is surprisingly small for this situation. To restore the blood flow in spite of this buildup would require an increase in the pressure difference P2−P1P2−P1 of a factor of two, with subsequent strain on the heart. P2−P1P2−P1 Table 12.1 Coefficients of Viscosity of Various Fluids The circulatory system provides many examples of Poiseuille’s law in action—with blood flow regulated by changes in vessel size and blood pressure. Blood vessels are not rigid but elastic. Adjustments to blood flow are primarily made by varying the size of the vessels, since the resistance is so sensitive to the radius. During vigorous exercise, blood vessels are selectively dilated to important muscles and organs and blood pressure increases. This creates both greater overall blood flow and increased flow to specific areas. Conversely, decreases in vessel radii, perhaps from plaques in the arteries, can greatly reduce blood flow. If a vessel’s radius is reduced by only 5% (to 0.95 of its original value), the flow rate is reduced to about (0.95)4=0.81(0.95)4=0.81 of its original value. A 19% decrease in flow is caused by a 5% decrease in radius. The body may compensate by increasing blood pressure by 19%, but this presents hazards to the heart and any vessel that has weakened walls. Another example comes from automobile engine oil. If you have a car with an oil pressure gauge, you may notice that oil pressure is high when the engine is cold. Motor oil has greater viscosity when cold than when warm, and so pressure must be greater to pump the same amount of cold oil. (0.95)4=0.81(0.95)4=0.81 Figure 12.14 Poiseuille’s law applies to laminar flow of an incompressible fluid of viscosity ηη through a tube of length ll and radius rr. The direction of flow is from greater to lower pressure. Flow rate QQ is directly proportional to the pressure difference P2−P1P2−P1, and inversely proportional to the length ll of the tube and viscosity ηη of the fluid. Flow rate increases with r4r4, the fourth power of the radius. Example 12.8 An intravenous (IV) system is supplying saline solution to a patient at the rate of 0.120cm3/s0.120cm3/s through a needle of radius 0.150 mm and length 2.50 cm. What pressure is needed at the entrance of the needle to cause this flow, assuming the viscosity of the saline solution to be the same as that of water? The gauge pressure of the blood in the patient’s vein is 8.00 mm Hg.  (Assume that the temperature is

20ºC Assuming laminar flow, Poiseuille’s law applies. This is given by 12.48 where P2P2 is the pressure at the entrance of the needle and P1P1 is the pressure in the vein. The only unknown is P2P2. P2P2 P1P1 P2P2 Solving for P2P2 yields P2P2 12.49 P1P1 is given as 8.00 mm Hg, which converts to 1.066×103N/m21.066×103N/m2. Substituting this and the other known values yields P1P1 1.066×103N/m21.066×103N/m2 12.50 This pressure could be supplied by an IV bottle with the surface of the saline solution 1.61 m above the entrance to the needle (this is left for you to solve in this chapter’s Problems and Exercises), assuming that there is negligible pressure drop in the tubing leading to the needle."
Page 131,"You may have noticed that water pressure in your home might be lower than normal on hot summer days when there is more use. This pressure drop occurs in the water main before it reaches your home. Let us consider flow through the water main as illustrated in Figure 12.15. We can understand why the pressure P1P1 to the home drops during times of heavy use by rearranging P1P1 12.51 to 12.52 where, in this case, P2P2 is the pressure at the water works and RR is the resistance of the water main. During times of heavy use, the flow rate QQ is large. This means that P2−P1P2−P1 must also be large. Thus P1P1 must decrease. It is correct to think of flow and resistance as causing the pressure to drop from P2P2 to P1P1. P2−P1=RQP2−P1=RQ is valid for both laminar and turbulent flows. P2P2 RR QQ P2−P1P2−P1 P1P1 P2P2 P1P1 P2−P1=RQP2−P1=RQ Figure 12.15 During times of heavy use, there is a significant pressure drop in a water main, and

 created at the water works. If the flow is very small, then the pressure drop is negligible, and P2≈P1P2≈P1. We can use P2−P1=RQP2−P1=RQ to analyze pressure drops occurring in more complex systems in which the tube radius is not the same everywhere. Resistance will be much greater in narrow places, such as an obstructed coronary artery. For a given flow rate QQ, the pressure drop will be greatest where the tube is most narrow. This is how water faucets control flow. Additionally, RR is greatly increased by turbulence, and a constriction that creates turbulence greatly reduces the pressure downstream. Plaque in an artery reduces pressure and hence flow, both by its resistance and by the turbulence it creates. P2−P1=RQP2−P1=RQ QQ RR Figure 12.16 is a schematic of the human circulatory system, showing average blood pressures in its major parts for an adult at rest. Pressure created by the heart’s two pumps, the right and left ventricles, is reduced by the resistance of the blood vessels as the blood flows through them. The left ventricle increases arterial blood pressure that drives the flow of blood through all parts of the body except the lungs. The right ventricle receives the lower pressure blood from two major veins and pumps it through the lungs for gas exchange with atmospheric gases – the disposal of carbon dioxide from the blood and the replenishment of oxygen. Only one major organ is shown schematically, with typical branching of arteries to ever smaller vessels, the smallest of which are the capillaries, and rejoining of small veins into larger ones. Similar branching takes place in a variety of organs in the body, and the circulatory system has considerable flexibility in flow regulation to these organs by the dilation and constriction of the arteries leading to them and the capillaries within them. The sensitivity of flow to tube radius makes this flexibility possible over a large range of flow rates. Figure 12.16 Schematic of the circulatory system. Pressure difference is created by the two pumps in the heart and is reduced by resistance in the vessels. Branching of vessels into capillaries allows blood to reach individual cells and exchange substances, such as oxygen and waste products, with them. The system has an impressive ability to regulate flow to individual organs, accomplished largely by varying vessel diameters. Each branching of larger vessels into smaller vessels increases the total cross-sectional area of the tubes through which the blood flows. For example, an artery with a cross section of 1cm21cm2 may branch into 20 smaller arteries, each with cross sections of

0.5cm20.5cm2, with a total of

10cm210cm2. In that manner, the resistance of the branchings is reduced so that pressure is not entirely lost. Moreover, because

Page 134,"There is something fishy about the ice cube from your freezer—how did it pick up those food odors? How does soaking a sprained ankle in Epsom salt reduce swelling? The answer to these questions are related to atomic and molecular transport phenomena—another mode of fluid motion. Atoms and molecules are in constant motion at any temperature. In fluids they move about randomly even in the absence of macroscopic flow. This motion is called a random walk and is illustrated in Figure 12.20. Diffusion is the movement of substances due to random thermal molecular motion. Fluids, like fish fumes or odors entering ice cubes, can even diffuse through solids. Diffusion Diffusion is a slow process over macroscopic distances. The densities of common materials are great enough that molecules cannot travel very far before having a collision that can scatter them in any direction, including straight backward. It can be shown that the average distance xrmsxrms that a molecule travels is proportional to the square root of time: xrmsxrms 12.58 where xrmsxrms stands for the root-mean-square distance and is the statistical average for the process. The quantity DD is the diffusion constant for the particular molecule in a specific medium. Table 12.2 lists representative values of DD for various substances, in units of m2/sm2/s. xrmsxrms DD DD m2/sm2/s Figure 12.20 The random thermal motion of a molecule in a fluid in time tt. This type of motion is called a random walk. Table 12.2 Diffusion Constants for Various Molecules3 Note that DD gets progressively smaller for more massive molecules. This decrease is because the average molecular speed at a given temperature is inversely proportional to molecular mass. Thus the more massive molecules diffuse more slowly. Another interesting point is that DD for oxygen in air is much greater than DD for oxygen in water. In water, an oxygen molecule makes many more collisions in its random walk and is slowed considerably. In water, an oxygen molecule moves only about 40

Page 134,"If you very carefully place a drop of food coloring in a still glass of water, it will slowly diffuse into the colorless surroundings until its concentration is the same everywhere. This type of diffusion is called free diffusion, because there are no barriers inhibiting it. Let us examine its direction and rate. Molecular motion is random in direction, and so simple chance dictates that more molecules will move out of a region of high concentration than into it. The net rate of diffusion is higher initially than after the process is partially completed. (See Figure 12.21.) Figure 12.21 Diffusion proceeds from a region of higher concentration to a lower one. The net rate of movement is proportional to the difference in concentration. The net rate of diffusion is proportional to the concentration difference. Many more molecules will leave a region of high concentration than will enter it from a region of low concentration. In fact, if the concentrations were the same, there would be  no net movement. The net rate of diffusion is also proportional to the diffusion constant DD, which is determined experimentally. The farther a molecule can diffuse in a given time, the more likely it is to leave the region of high concentration. Many of the factors that affect the rate are hidden in the diffusion constant DD. For example, temperature and cohesive and adhesive forces all affect values of DD. DD DD DD Diffusion is the dominant mechanism by which the exchange of nutrients and waste products occur between the blood and tissue, and between air and blood in the lungs. In the evolutionary process, as organisms became larger, they needed quicker methods of transportation than net diffusion, because of the larger distances involved in the transport, leading to the development of circulatory systems. Less sophisticated, single-celled organisms still rely totally on diffusion for the removal of waste products and the uptake of nutrients."
Page 134,"Some of the most interesting examples of diffusion occur through barriers that affect the rates of diffusion. For example, when you soak a swollen ankle in Epsom salt, water diffuses through your skin. Many substances regularly move through cell membranes; oxygen moves in, carbon dioxide moves out, nutrients go in, and wastes go out, for example. Because membranes are thin structures (typically 6.5×10−96.5×10−9 to 10×10−910×10−9 m across) diffusion rates through them can be high. Diffusion through membranes is an important method of transport. 6.5×10−96.5×10−9 10×10−910×10−9 Membranes are generally selectively permeable, or semipermeable. (See Figure 12.22.) One type of semipermeable membrane has small pores that allow only small molecules to pass through. In other types of membranes, the molecules may actually dissolve in the membrane or react with molecules in the membrane while moving across. Membrane function, in fact, is the subject of much current research, involving not only physiology but also chemistry and physics. semipermeable Figure 12.22 (a) A semipermeable membrane with small pores that allow only small molecules to pass through. (b) Certain molecules dissolve in this membrane and diffuse across it. Osmosis is the transport of water through a semipermeable membrane from a region of high concentration to a region of low concentration. Osmosis is driven by the imbalance in water concentration. For example, water is more concentrated in your body than in Epsom salt. When you soak a swollen ankle in Epsom salt, the water moves out of your body into the lower-concentration region in the salt. Similarly, dialysis is the transport of any other molecule through a semipermeable membrane due to its concentration difference. Both osmosis and dialysis are used by the kidneys to cleanse the blood. Osmosis dialysis Osmosis can create a substantial pressure. Consider what happens if osmosis continues for some time, as illustrated in Figure 12.23. Water moves by osmosis from the left into the region on the right, where it is less concentrated, causing the solution on the right to rise. This movement will continue until the pressure ρghρgh created by the extra height of fluid on the right is large enough to stop further osmosis. This pressure is called a back pressure. The back pressure ρghρgh that stops osmosis is also called the relative osmotic pressure if neither solution is pure water, and it is called the osmotic pressure if one solution is pure water. Osmotic pressure can be large, depending on the size of the concentration difference. For example, if pure water and sea water are separated by a semipermeable membrane that passes no salt, osmotic pressure will be 25.9 atm. This value means that water will diffuse through the membrane until the salt water surface rises 268 m above the pure-water surface! One example of pressure created by osmosis is turgor in plants (many wilt when too dry). Turgor describes the condition of a plant in which the fluid in a cell exerts a pressure against the cell wall. This pressure gives the plant support. Dialysis can similarly cause substantial pressures. ρghρgh ρghρgh relative osmotic pressure osmotic pressure Figure 12.23 (a) Two sugar-water solutions of different concentrations, separated by a semipermeable membrane that passes water but not sugar. Osmosis will be to the right, since water is less concentrated there. (b) The fluid level rises until the back pressure ρghρgh equals the relative osmotic pressure; then, the net transfer of water is zero. Reverse osmosis and reverse dialysis (also called filtration) are processes that occur when back pressure is sufficient to reverse the normal direction of substances through membranes. Back pressure can be created naturally as on the right side of Figure 12.23. (A piston can also create this pressure.) Reverse osmosis can be used to desalinate water by simply forcing it through a membrane that will not pass salt. Similarly, reverse dialysis can be used to filter out any substance that a given membrane will not pass. Reverse osmosis reverse dialysis One further example of the movement of substances through membranes deserves mention. We sometimes find that substances pass in the direction opposite to what we expect. Cypress tree roots, for example, extract pure water from salt water, although osmosis would move it in the opposite direction. This is not reverse osmosis, because there is no back pressure to cause it. What is happening is called active transport, a process in which a living membrane expends energy to move substances across it. Many living membranes move water and other substances by active transport. The kidneys, for example, not only use osmosis and dialysis—they also employ significant active transport to move substances into and out of blood. In fact, it is estimated that at least 25% of the body’s energy is expended on active transport of substances at the cellular level. The study of active transport carries us into the realms of microbiology, biophysics, and biochemistry and it is a fascinating application of the laws of nature to living structures. active transport"

Page 140,"On a cold winter morning, the wood on a porch feels warmer than the metal of your bike. The wood and bicycle are in thermal equilibrium with the outside air, and are thus the same temperature. They feel different because of the difference in the way that they conduct heat away from your skin. The metal conducts heat away from your body faster than the wood does (see more about conductivity in Conduction). This is just one example demonstrating that the human sense of hot and cold is not determined by temperature alone. Another factor that affects our perception of temperature is humidity. Most people feel much hotter on hot, humid days than on hot, dry days. This is because on humid days, sweat does not evaporate from the skin as efficiently as it does on dry days. It is the evaporation of sweat (or water from a sprinkler or pool) that cools us off."
Page 140,"Thermometers are used to measure temperature according to well-defined scales of measurement, which use pre-defined reference points to help compare quantities. The three most common temperature scales are the Fahrenheit, Celsius, and Kelvin scales. A temperature scale can be created by identifying two easily reproducible temperatures. The freezing and boiling temperatures of water at standard atmospheric pressure are commonly used. The Celsius scale (which replaced the slightly different  centigrade scale) has the freezing point of water at 0ºC0ºC and the boiling point at 100ºC100ºC. Its unit is the degree Celsius(ºC)(ºC). On the Fahrenheit scale (still the most frequently used in the United States), the freezing point of water is at 32ºF32ºF and the boiling point is at 212ºF212ºF. The unit of temperature on this scale is the degree Fahrenheit(ºF)(ºF). Note that a temperature difference of one degree Celsius is greater than a temperature difference of one degree Fahrenheit. Only 100 Celsius degrees span the same range as 180 Fahrenheit degrees, thus one degree on the Celsius scale is 1.8 times larger than one degree on the Fahrenheit scale 180/100=9/5.180/100=9/5.

The Kelvin scale is the temperature scale that is commonly used in science. It is an absolute temperature scale defined to have 0 K at the lowest possible temperature, called absolute zero. The official temperature unit on this scale is the kelvin, which is abbreviated K, and is not accompanied by a degree sign. The freezing and boiling points of water are 273.15 K and 373.15 K, respectively. Thus, the magnitude of temperature differences is the same in units of kelvins and degrees Celsius. Unlike other temperature scales, the Kelvin scale is an absolute scale. It is used extensively in scientific work because a number of physical quantities, such as the volume of an ideal gas, are directly related to absolute temperature. The kelvin is the SI unit used in scientific work. Kelvin absolute zero Figure 13.6 Relationships between the Fahrenheit, Celsius, and Kelvin temperature scales, rounded to the nearest degree. The relative sizes of the scales are also shown. The relationships between the three common temperature scales is shown in Figure 13.6. Temperatures on these scales can be converted using the equations in Table 13.1. Table 13.1 Temperature Conversions Notice that the conversions between Fahrenheit and Kelvin look quite complicated. In fact, they are simple combinations of the conversions between Fahrenheit and Celsius, and the conversions between Celsius and Kelvin.

Note that zero on a logarithmic scale would occur off the bottom of the page at infinity. Making Connections: Absolute Zero What is absolute zero? Absolute zero is the temperature at which all molecular motion has ceased. The concept of absolute zero arises from the behavior of gases. Figure 13.9 shows how the pressure of gases at a constant volume decreases as temperature decreases. Various scientists have noted that the pressures of gases extrapolate to zero at the same temperature, –273.15ºC–273.15ºC. This extrapolation implies that there is a lowest temperature. This temperature is called absolute zero. Today we know that most gases first liquefy and then freeze, and it is not actually possible to reach absolute zero. The numerical value of absolute zero temperature is –273.15ºC–273.15ºC or 0 K. –273.15ºC–273.15ºC –273.15ºC–273.15ºC Figure 13.9 Graph of pressure versus temperature for various gases kept at a constant volume. Note that all of the graphs extrapolate to zero pressure at the same temperature. Thermometers actually take their own temperature, not the temperature of the object they are measuring. This raises the question of how we can be certain that a thermometer measures the temperature of the object with which it is in contact. It is based on the fact that any two systems placed in thermal contact (meaning heat transfer can occur between them) will reach the same temperature. That is, heat will flow from the hotter object to the cooler one until they have exactly the same temperature. The objects are then in thermal equilibrium, and no further changes will occur. The systems interact and change because their temperatures differ, and the changes stop once their temperatures are the same. Thus, if enough time is allowed for this transfer of heat to run its course, the temperature a thermometer registers does represent the system with which it is in thermal equilibrium. Thermal equilibrium is established when two bodies are in contact with each other and can freely exchange energy. thermal equilibrium Furthermore, experimentation has shown that if two systems, A and B, are in thermal equilibrium with each another, and B is in thermal equilibrium with a third system C, then A is also in thermal equilibrium with C. This conclusion may seem obvious, because all three have the same temperature, but it is basic to thermodynamics. It is called the zeroth law of thermodynamics. zeroth law of thermodynamics The Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics If two systems, A and B, are in thermal equilibrium with each other, and B is in thermal equilibrium with a third system, C, then A is also in thermal equilibrium with C. This law was postulated in the 1930s, after the first and second laws of thermodynamics had been developed and named. It is called the zeroth law because it comes logically before the first and second laws (discussed in Thermodynamics). Suppose, for example, a cold metal block and a hot metal block are both placed on a metal plate at room temperature. Eventually the cold block and the plate will be in thermal equilibrium. In addition, the hot block and the plate will be in thermal equilibrium. By the zeroth law, we can conclude that the cold block and the hot block are also in thermal equilibrium.

Page 141,"Objects expand in all dimensions, as illustrated in Figure 13.11. That is, their areas and volumes, as well as their lengths, increase with temperature. Holes also get larger with temperature. If you cut a hole in a metal plate, the remaining material will expand exactly as it would if the plug was still in place. The plug would get bigger, and so the hole must get bigger too. (Think of the ring of neighboring atoms or molecules on the wall of the hole as pushing each other farther apart as temperature increases. Obviously, the ring of neighbors must get slightly larger, so the hole gets slightly larger). Thermal Expansion in Two Dimensions For small temperature changes, the change in area ΔAΔA is given by ΔAΔA 13.9 where ΔAΔA is the change in area AA, ΔTΔT is the change in temperature, and αα is the coefficient of linear expansion, which varies slightly with temperature. ΔAΔA AA ΔTΔT αα Figure 13.11 In general, objects expand in all directions as temperature increases. In these drawings, the original boundaries of the objects are shown with solid lines, and the expanded boundaries with dashed lines. (a) Area increases because both length and width increase. The area of a circular plug also increases. (b) If the plug is removed, the hole it leaves becomes larger with increasing temperature, just as if the expanding plug were still in place. (c) Volume also increases, because all three dimensions increase. Thermal Expansion in Three Dimensions The change in volume ΔVΔV is very nearly ΔV=3αVΔTΔV=3αVΔT. This equation is usually written as ΔVΔV ΔV=3αVΔTΔV=3αVΔT 13.10 where ββ is the coefficient of volume expansion and β≈3αβ≈3α. Note that the values of ββ in Table 13.2 are almost exactly equal to 3α3α. ββ coefficient of volume expansion β≈3αβ≈3α ββ 3α3α In general, objects will expand with increasing temperature. Water is the most important exception to this rule. Water expands with increasing temperature (its density decreases) when it is at temperatures greater than 4ºC (40ºF)4ºC (40ºF). However, it expands with decreasing temperature when it is between +4ºC+4ºC and 0ºC0ºC(40ºF(40ºF to 32ºF)32ºF). Water is densest at +4ºC+4ºC. (See Figure 13.12.) Perhaps the most striking effect of this phenomenon is the freezing of water in a pond. When water near the surface cools down to 4ºC4ºC it is denser than the remaining water and thus will sink to the bottom. This “turnover” results in a layer of warmer water near the surface, which is then cooled. Eventually the pond has a uniform temperature of 4ºC4ºC. If the temperature in the surface layer drops below 4ºC4ºC, the water is less dense than the water below, and thus stays near the top. As a result, the pond surface can completely freeze over. The ice on top of liquid water provides an insulating layer from winter’s harsh exterior air temperatures. Fish and other aquatic life can survive in 4ºC4ºC water beneath ice, due to this unusual characteristic of water. It also produces circulation of water in the pond that is necessary for a healthy ecosystem of the body of water. 4ºC (40ºF)4ºC (40ºF) +4ºC+4ºC 0ºC0ºC (40ºF(40ºF 32ºF)32ºF) +4ºC+4ºC 4ºC4ºC 4ºC4ºC 4ºC4ºC 4ºC4ºC Figure 13.12 The density of water as a function of temperature.

Making Connections: Real-World Connections—Filling the Tank Differences in the thermal expansion of materials can lead to interesting effects at the gas station. One example is the dripping of gasoline from a freshly filled tank on a hot day. Gasoline starts out at the temperature of the ground under the gas station, which is cooler than the air temperature above. The gasoline cools the steel tank when it is filled. Both gasoline and steel tank expand as they warm to air temperature, but gasoline expands much more than steel, and so it may overflow. This difference in expansion can also cause problems when interpreting the gasoline gauge. The actual amount (mass) of gasoline left in the tank when the gauge hits “empty” is a lot less in the summer than in the winter. The gasoline has the same volume as it does in the winter when the “add fuel” light goes on, but because the gasoline has expanded, there is less mass. If you are used to getting another 40 miles on “empty” in the winter, beware—you will probably run out much more quickly in the summer. Figure 13.13 Because the gas expands more than the gas tank with increasing temperature, you can’t drive as many miles on “empty” in the summer as you can in the winter. (credit: Hector Alejandro, Flickr) Example 13.4 Suppose your 60.0-L (15.9-gal) steel gasoline tank is full of gas, so both the tank and the gasoline have a temperature of 15.0ºC15.0ºC. How much gasoline has spilled by the time they warm to 35.0ºC35.0ºC? 15.0ºC15.0ºC 35.0ºC35.0ºC The tank and gasoline increase in volume, but the gasoline increases more, so the amount spilled is the difference in their volume changes. (The gasoline tank can be treated as solid steel.) We can use the equation for volume expansion to calculate the change in volume of the gasoline and of the tank. 1. Use the equation for volume expansion to calculate the increase in volume of the steel tank: 13.11 2. The increase in volume of the gasoline is given by this equation: 13.12 3. Find the difference in volume to determine the amount spilled as 13.13 Alternatively, we can combine these three equations into a single equation. (Note that the original volumes are equal.) 13.14 This amount is significant, particularly for a 60.0-L tank. The effect is so striking because the gasoline and steel expand quickly. The rate of change in thermal properties is discussed in Heat and Heat Transfer Methods. If you try to cap the tank tightly to prevent overflow, you will find that it leaks anyway, either around the cap or by bursting the tank. Tightly constricting the expanding gas is equivalent to compressing it, and both liquids and solids resist being compressed with extremely large forces. To avoid rupturing rigid containers, these containers have air gaps, which allow them to expand and contract without stressing them."
Page 141,"Thermal stress is created by thermal expansion or contraction (see Elasticity: Stress and Strain for a discussion of stress and strain). Thermal stress can be destructive, such as when expanding gasoline ruptures a tank. It can also be useful, for example, when two parts are joined together by heating one in manufacturing, then slipping it over the other and allowing the combination to cool. Thermal stress can explain many phenomena, such as the weathering of rocks and pavement by the expansion of ice when it freezes. Thermal stress Example 13.5 What pressure would be created in the gasoline tank considered in Example 13.4, if the gasoline increases in temperature from 15.0ºC15.0ºC to 35.0ºC35.0ºC without being allowed to expand?

We will use the amount spilled in Example 13.4 as the change in volume, ΔVΔV. F/AF/A V0V0 BB ΔVΔV 1. Rearrange the equation for calculating pressure: 13.16 2. Insert the known values. The bulk modulus for gasoline is B=1.00×109 N/m2B=1.00×109 N/m2. In the previous example, the change in volume ΔV=1.10 LΔV=1.10 L is the amount that would spill. Here, V0=60.0 LV0=60.0 L is the original volume of the gasoline. Substituting these values into the equation, we obtain B=1.00×109 N/m2B=1.00×109 N/m2 ΔV=1.10 LΔV=1.10 L V0=60.0 LV0=60.0 L 13.17 This pressure is about 2500lb/in22500lb/in2, much more than a gasoline tank can handle. 2500lb/in22500lb/in2 Forces and pressures created by thermal stress are typically as great as that in the example above. Railroad tracks and roadways can buckle on hot days if they lack sufficient expansion joints. (See Figure 13.14.) Power lines sag more in the summer than in the winter, and will snap in cold weather if there is insufficient slack. Cracks open and close in plaster walls as a house warms and cools. Glass cooking pans will crack if cooled rapidly or unevenly, because of differential contraction and the stresses it creates. (Pyrex® is less susceptible because of its small coefficient of thermal expansion.) Nuclear reactor pressure vessels are threatened by overly rapid cooling, and although none have failed, several have been cooled faster than considered desirable. Biological cells are ruptured when foods are frozen, detracting from their taste. Repeated thawing and freezing accentuate the damage. Even the oceans can be affected. A significant portion of the rise in sea level that is resulting from global warming is due to the thermal expansion of sea water. Figure 13.14 Thermal stress contributes to the formation of potholes. (credit: Editor5807, Wikimedia Commons) Metal is regularly used in the human body for hip and knee implants. Most implants need to be replaced over time because, among other things, metal does not bond with bone. Researchers are trying to find better metal coatings that would allow metal-to-bone bonding. One challenge is to find a coating that has an expansion coefficient similar to that of metal. If the expansion coefficients are too different, the thermal stresses during the manufacturing process lead to cracks at the coating-metal interface. Another example of thermal stress is found in the mouth. Dental fillings can expand differently from tooth enamel. It can give pain when eating ice cream or having a hot drink.

Page 142,"It is sometimes convenient to work with a unit other than molecules when measuring the amount of substance. A mole (abbreviated mol) is defined to be the amount of a substance that contains as many atoms or molecules as there are atoms in exactly 12 grams (0.012 kg) of carbon-12. The actual number of atoms or molecules in one mole is called Avogadro’s number(NA)(NA), in recognition of Italian scientist Amedeo Avogadro (1776–1856). He developed the concept of the mole, based on the hypothesis that equal volumes of gas, at the same pressure and temperature, contain equal numbers of molecules. That is, the number is independent of the type of gas. This hypothesis has been confirmed, and the value of Avogadro’s number is mole Avogadro’s number (NA)(NA) 13.28 Avogadro’s Number One mole always contains 6.02×10236.02×1023 particles (atoms or molecules), independent of the element or substance.

(C8H9NO2)(C8H9NO2) Solution We first need to calculate the molar mass (the mass of one mole) of acetaminophen. To do this, we need to multiply the number of atoms of each element by the element’s atomic mass. 13.30 Then we need to calculate the number of moles in 325 mg. 13.31 Then use Avogadro’s number to calculate the number of molecules. 13.32 Example 13.8 Calculate: (a) the number of moles in 1.00 m31.00 m3 of gas at STP, and (b) the number of liters of gas per mole. 1.00 m31.00 m3 (a) We are asked to find the number of moles per cubic meter, and we know from Example 13.7 that the number of molecules per cubic meter at STP is 2.68×10252.68×1025. The number of moles can be found by dividing the number of molecules by Avogadro’s number. We let nn stand for the number of moles, 2.68×10252.68×1025 nn 13.33 (b) Using the value obtained for the number of moles in a cubic meter, and converting cubic meters to liters, we obtain 13.34 This value is very close to the accepted value of 22.4 L/mol. The slight difference is due to rounding errors caused by using three-digit input. Again this number is the same for all gases. In other words, it is independent of the gas. The (average) molar weight of air (approximately 80% N2N2 and 20% O2O2 is M=28.8 g.M=28.8 g. Thus the mass of one cubic meter of air is 1.28 kg.

(P=1atm(P=1atm T=20ºC)T=20ºC) 1.28 kg/m31.28 kg/m3 0.64 kg/m30.64 kg/m3 Solution The best way to approach this question is to think about what is happening. If the density drops to half its original value and no molecules are lost, then the volume must double. If we look at the equation PV=NkTPV=NkT, we see that when the temperature is constant, the pressure is inversely proportional to volume. Therefore, if the volume doubles, the pressure must drop to half its original value, and Pf=0.50 atm.Pf=0.50 atm. PV=NkTPV=NkT Pf=0.50 atm.Pf=0.50 atm."

Page 142,"A very common expression of the ideal gas law uses the number of moles, nn, rather than the number of atoms and molecules, NN.

Rearrange the equation to solve for nn and substitute known values. nn 13.41 The most convenient choice for RR in this case is 8.31 J/mol⋅K,8.31 J/mol⋅K, because our known quantities are in SI units. The pressure and temperature are obtained from the initial conditions in Example 13.6, but we would get the same answer if we used the final values. RR 8.31 J/mol⋅K,8.31 J/mol⋅K, The ideal gas law can be considered to be another manifestation of the law of conservation of energy (see Conservation of Energy). Work done on a gas results in an increase in its energy, increasing pressure and/or temperature, or decreasing volume. This increased energy can also be viewed as increased internal kinetic energy, given the gas’s atoms and molecules."
Page 142,"Let us now examine the role of energy in the behavior of gases. When you inflate a bike tire by hand, you do work by repeatedly exerting a force through a distance. This energy goes into increasing the pressure of air inside the tire and increasing the temperature of the pump and the air. The ideal gas law is closely related to energy: the units on both sides are joules. The right-hand side of the ideal gas law in PV=NkTPV=NkT is NkTNkT. This term is roughly the amount of translational kinetic energy of NN atoms or molecules at an absolute temperature TT, as we shall see formally in Kinetic Theory: Atomic and Molecular Explanation of Pressure and Temperature. The left-hand side of the ideal gas law is PVPV, which also has the units of joules. We know from our study of fluids that pressure is one type of potential energy per unit volume, so pressure multiplied by volume is energy. The important point is that there is energy in a gas related to both its pressure and its volume. The energy can be changed when the gas is doing work as it expands—something we explore in Heat and Heat Transfer Methods—similar to what occurs in gasoline or steam engines and turbines. PV=NkTPV=NkT NkTNkT NN TT PVPV Problem-Solving Strategy: The Ideal Gas Law Step 1 Examine the situation to determine that an ideal gas is involved. Most gases are nearly ideal. Step 2 Make a list of what quantities are given, or can be inferred from the problem as stated (identify the known quantities). Convert known values into proper SI units (K for temperature, Pa for pressure, m3m3 for volume, molecules for NN, and moles for nn). m3m3 NN nn Step 3 Identify exactly what needs to be determined in the problem (identify the unknown quantities). A written list is useful. Step 4 Determine whether the number of molecules or the number of moles is known, in order to decide which form of the ideal gas law to use. The first form is PV=NkTPV=NkT and involves NN, the number of atoms or molecules. The second form is PV=nRTPV=nRT and involves nn, the number of moles. PV=NkTPV=NkT NN PV=nRTPV=nRT nn Step 5 Solve the ideal gas law for the quantity to be determined (the unknown quantity). You may need to take a ratio of final states to initial states to eliminate the unknown quantities that are kept fixed. Step 6 Substitute the known quantities, along with their units, into the appropriate equation, and obtain numerical solutions complete with units. Be certain to use absolute temperature and absolute pressure. Step 7 Check the answer to see if it is reasonable: Does it make sense? Check Your Understanding Liquids and solids have densities about 1000 times greater than gases. Explain how this implies that the distances between atoms and molecules in gases are about 10 times greater than the size of their atoms and molecules. Solution Atoms and molecules are close together in solids and liquids. In gases they are separated by empty space. Thus gases have lower densities than liquids and solids. Density is mass per unit volume, and volume is related to the size of a body (such as a sphere) cubed. So if the distance between atoms and molecules increases by a factor of 10, then the volume occupied increases by a factor of 1000, and the density decreases by a factor of 1000."

Page 143,"Figure 13.21 shows a box filled with a gas. We know from our previous discussions that putting more gas into the box produces greater pressure, and that increasing the temperature of the gas also produces a greater pressure. But why should increasing the temperature of the gas increase the pressure in the box? A look at the atomic and molecular scale gives us some answers, and an alternative expression for the ideal gas law. The figure shows an expanded view of an elastic collision of a gas molecule with the wall of a container. Calculating the average force exerted by such molecules will lead us to the ideal gas law, and to the connection between temperature and molecular kinetic energy. We assume that a molecule is small compared with the separation of molecules in the gas, and that its interaction with other molecules can be ignored. We also assume the wall is rigid and that the molecule’s direction changes, but that its speed remains constant (and hence its kinetic energy and the magnitude of its momentum remain constant as well). This assumption is not always valid, but the same result is obtained with a more detailed description of the molecule’s exchange of energy and momentum with the wall. Figure 13.21 Gas in a box exerts an outward pressure on its walls. A molecule colliding with a rigid wall has the direction of its velocity and momentum in the xx-direction reversed. This direction is perpendicular to the wall. The components of its velocity momentum in the yy- and zz-directions are not changed, which means there is no force parallel to the wall. If the molecule’s velocity changes in the xx-direction, its momentum changes from –mvx–mvx to +mvx+mvx. Thus, its change in momentum is Δmv= +mvx––mvx=2mvxΔmv= +mvx––mvx=2mvx. The force exerted on the molecule is given by xx –mvx–mvx +mvx+mvx Δmv= +mvx––mvx=2mvxΔmv= +mvx––mvx=2mvx 13.45 There is no force between the wall and the molecule until the molecule hits the wall. During the short time of the collision, the force between the molecule and wall is relatively large. We are looking for an average force; we take ΔtΔt to be the average time between collisions of the molecule with this wall. It is the time it would take the molecule to go across the box and back (a distance 2l)2l) at a speed of vxvx. Thus Δt=2l/vxΔt=2l/vx, and the expression for the force becomes ΔtΔt 2l)2l) vxvx Δt=2l/vxΔt=2l/vx 13.46 This force is due to one molecule. We multiply by the number of molecules NN and use their average squared velocity to find the force NN 13.47 where the bar over a quantity means its average value. We would like to have the force in terms of the speed vv, rather than the xx-component of the velocity. We note that the total velocity squared is the sum of the squares of its components, so that vv xx 13.48 Because the velocities are random, their average components in all directions are the same: 13.49 Thus, 13.50 or 13.51 Substituting 13v¯213v¯2 into the expression for FF gives 13v¯213v¯2 FF 13.52 The pressure is F/A,F/A, so that we obtain F/A,F/A, 13.53 where we used V=AlV=Al for the volume. This gives the important result. V=AlV=Al 13.54 This equation is another expression of the ideal gas law."
Page 143,"The motion of molecules in a gas is random in magnitude and direction for individual molecules, but a gas of many molecules has a predictable distribution of molecular speeds. This distribution is called the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, after its originators, who calculated it based on kinetic theory, and has since been confirmed experimentally. (See Figure 13.23.) The distribution has a long tail, because a few molecules may go several times the rms speed. The most probable speed vpvp is less than the rms speed vrmsvrms. Figure 13.24 shows that the curve is shifted to higher speeds at higher temperatures, with a broader range of speeds. vpvp vrmsvrms Figure 13.23 The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution of molecular speeds in an ideal gas. The most likely speed vpvp is less than the rms speed vrmsvrms. Although very high speeds are possible, only a tiny fraction of the molecules have speeds that are an order of magnitude greater than vrmsvrms. The distribution of thermal speeds depends strongly on temperature. As temperature increases, the speeds are shifted to higher values and the distribution is broadened. Figure 13.24 The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution is shifted to higher speeds and is broadened at higher temperatures. What is the implication of the change in distribution with temperature shown in Figure 13.24 for humans? All other things being equal, if a person has a fever, they are likely to lose more water molecules, particularly from linings along moist cavities such as the lungs and mouth, creating a dry sensation in the mouth. Example 13.11 In order to escape Earth’s gravity, an object near the top of the atmosphere (at an altitude of 100 km) must travel away from Earth at 11.1 km/s. This speed is called the escape velocity. At what temperature would helium atoms have an rms speed equal to the escape velocity? Identify the knowns and unknowns and determine which equations to use to solve the problem. 1. Identify the knowns: vv is the escape velocity, 11.1 km/s. vv 2. Identify the unknowns: We need to solve for temperature, TT. We also need to solve for the mass mm of the helium atom. TT mm 3.

Plug the known values into the equations and solve for the unknowns. 13.66 13.67 This temperature is much higher than atmospheric temperature, which is approximately 250 K (–25ºC(–25ºC or –10ºF)–10ºF) at high altitude. Very few helium atoms are left in the atmosphere, but there were many when the atmosphere was formed. The reason for the loss of helium atoms is that there are a small number of helium atoms with speeds higher than Earth’s escape velocity even at normal temperatures. The speed of a helium atom changes from one instant to the next, so that at any instant, there is a small, but nonzero chance that the speed is greater than the escape speed and the molecule escapes from Earth’s gravitational pull. Heavier molecules, such as oxygen, nitrogen, and water (very little of which reach a very high altitude), have smaller rms speeds, and so it is much less likely that any of them will have speeds greater than the escape velocity. In fact, so few have speeds above the escape velocity that billions of years are required to lose significant amounts of the atmosphere. Figure 13.25 shows the impact of a lack of an atmosphere on the Moon. Because the gravitational pull of the Moon is much weaker, it has lost almost its entire atmosphere. The comparison between Earth and the Moon is discussed in this chapter’s Problems and Exercises. (–25ºC(–25ºC –10ºF)–10ºF) Figure 13.25 This photograph of Apollo 17 Commander Eugene Cernan driving the lunar rover on the Moon in 1972 looks as though it was taken at night with a large spotlight. In fact, the light is coming from the Sun. Because the acceleration due to gravity on the Moon is so low (about 1/6 that of Earth), the Moon’s escape velocity is much smaller. As a result, gas molecules escape very easily from the Moon, leaving it with virtually no atmosphere. Even during the daytime, the sky is black because there is no gas to scatter sunlight.

Schmitt/NASA) Check Your Understanding If you consider a very small object such as a grain of pollen, in a gas, then the number of atoms and molecules striking its surface would also be relatively small. Would the grain of pollen experience any fluctuations in pressure due to statistical fluctuations in the number of gas atoms and molecules striking it in a given amount of time? Solution Yes. Such fluctuations actually occur for a body of any size in a gas, but since the numbers of atoms and molecules are immense for macroscopic bodies, the fluctuations are a tiny percentage of the number of collisions, and the averages spoken of in this section vary imperceptibly. Roughly speaking the fluctuations are proportional to the inverse square root of the number of collisions, so for small bodies they can become significant. This was actually observed in the 19th century for pollen grains in water, and is known as the Brownian effect.

Page 144,"We can examine aspects of the behavior of a substance by plotting a graph of pressure versus volume, called a PV diagram. When the substance behaves like an ideal gas, the ideal gas law describes the relationship between its pressure and volume. That is, PV diagram 13.68 Now, assuming the number of molecules and the temperature are fixed, 13.69 For example, the volume of the gas will decrease as the pressure increases. If you plot the relationship PV=constantPV=constant on a PVPV diagram, you find a hyperbola. Figure 13.27 shows a graph of pressure versus volume. The hyperbolas represent ideal-gas behavior at various fixed temperatures, and are called isotherms. At lower temperatures, the curves begin to look less like hyperbolas—the gas is not behaving ideally and may even contain liquid. There is a critical point—that is, a critical temperature—above which liquid cannot exist. At sufficiently high pressure above the critical point, the gas will have the density of a liquid but will not condense. Carbon dioxide, for example, cannot be liquefied at a temperature above 31.0ºC31.0ºC. Critical pressure is the minimum pressure needed for liquid to exist at the critical temperature. Table 13.3 lists representative critical temperatures and pressures. PV=constantPV=constant PVPV critical point critical temperature 31.0ºC31.0ºC Critical pressure Figure 13.27 PVPV diagrams.

The lower curves are not hyperbolas, because the gas is no longer an ideal gas. (b) An expanded portion of the PVPV diagram for low temperatures, where the phase can change from a gas to a liquid. The term “vapor” refers to the gas phase when it exists at a temperature below the boiling temperature. Table 13.3 Critical Temperatures and Pressures"
Page 144,"The plots of pressure versus temperatures provide considerable insight into thermal properties of substances. There are well-defined regions on these graphs that correspond to various phases of matter, so PTPT graphs are called phase diagrams. Figure 13.28 shows the phase diagram for water. Using the graph, if you know the pressure and temperature you can determine the phase of water. The solid lines—boundaries between phases—indicate temperatures and pressures at which the phases coexist (that is, they exist together in ratios, depending on pressure and temperature). For example, the boiling point of water is 100ºC100ºC at 1.00 atm. As the pressure increases, the boiling temperature rises steadily to 374ºC374ºC at a pressure of 218 atm. A pressure cooker (or even a covered pot) will cook food faster because the water can exist as a liquid at temperatures greater than 100ºC100ºC without all boiling away. The curve ends at a point called the critical point, because at higher temperatures the liquid phase does not exist at any pressure. The critical point occurs at the critical temperature, as you can see for water from Table 13.3. The critical temperature for oxygen is –118ºC–118ºC, so oxygen cannot be liquefied above this temperature.

This graph is simplified—there are several other exotic phases of ice at higher pressures. Similarly, the curve between the solid and liquid regions in Figure 13.28 gives the melting temperature at various pressures. For example, the melting point is 0ºC0ºC at 1.00 atm, as expected. Note that, at a fixed temperature, you can change the phase from solid (ice) to liquid (water) by increasing the pressure. Ice melts from pressure in the hands of a snowball maker. From the phase diagram, we can also say that the melting temperature of ice falls with increased pressure. When a car is driven over snow, the increased pressure from the tires melts the snowflakes; afterwards the water refreezes and forms an ice layer. 0ºC0ºC At sufficiently low pressures there is no liquid phase, but the substance can exist as either gas or solid. For water, there is no liquid phase at pressures below 0.00600 atm. The phase change from solid to gas is called sublimation. It accounts for large losses of snow pack that never make it into a river, the routine automatic defrosting of a freezer, and the freeze-drying process applied to many foods. Carbon dioxide, on the other hand, sublimates at standard atmospheric pressure of 1 atm. (The solid form of CO2CO2 is known as dry ice because it does not melt. Instead, it moves directly from the solid to the gas state.) sublimation CO2CO2 All three curves on the phase diagram meet at a single point, the triple point, where all three phases exist in equilibrium. For water, the triple point occurs at 273.16 K (0.01ºC)(0.01ºC), and is a more accurate calibration temperature than the melting point of water at 1.00 atm, or 273.15 K (0.0ºC)(0.0ºC).

Page 144,"Liquid and gas phases are in equilibrium at the boiling temperature. (See Figure 13.29.) If a substance is in a closed container at the boiling point, then the liquid is boiling and the gas is condensing at the same rate without net change in their relative amount. Molecules in the liquid escape as a gas at the same rate at which gas molecules stick to the liquid, or form droplets and become part of the liquid phase. The combination of temperature and pressure has to be “just right”; if the temperature and pressure are increased, equilibrium is maintained by the same increase of boiling and condensation rates. Figure 13.29 Equilibrium between liquid and gas at two different boiling points inside a closed container. (a) The rates of boiling and condensation are equal at this combination of temperature and pressure, so the liquid and gas phases are in equilibrium. (b) At a higher temperature, the boiling rate is faster and the rates at which molecules leave the liquid and enter the gas are also faster. Because there are more molecules in the gas, the gas pressure is higher and the rate at which gas molecules condense and enter the liquid is faster. As a result the gas and liquid are in equilibrium at this higher temperature. Table 13.4 Triple Point Temperatures and Pressures One example of equilibrium between liquid and gas is that of water and steam at 100ºC100ºC and 1.00 atm. This temperature is the boiling point at that pressure, so they should exist in equilibrium. Why does an open pot of water at 100ºC100ºC boil completely away? The gas surrounding an open pot is not pure water: it is mixed with air. If pure water and steam are in a closed container at 100ºC100ºC and 1.00 atm, they would coexist—but with air over the pot, there are fewer water molecules to condense, and water boils. What about water at 20.0ºC20.0ºC and 1.00 atm? This temperature and pressure correspond to the liquid region, yet an open glass of water at this temperature will completely evaporate. Again, the gas around it is air and not pure water vapor, so that the reduced evaporation rate is greater than the condensation rate of water from dry air. If the glass is sealed, then the liquid phase remains.

Page 144,"Vapor pressure is defined as the pressure at which a gas coexists with its solid or liquid phase. Vapor pressure is created by faster molecules that break away from the liquid or solid and enter the gas phase. The vapor pressure of a substance depends on both the substance and its temperature—an increase in temperature increases the vapor pressure. Vapor pressure Partial pressure is defined as the pressure a gas would create if it occupied the total volume available. In a mixture of gases, the total pressure is the sum of partial pressures of the component gases, assuming ideal gas behavior and no chemical reactions between the components. This law is known as Dalton’s law of partial pressures, after the English scientist John Dalton (1766–1844), who proposed it. Dalton’s law is based on kinetic theory, where each gas creates its pressure by molecular collisions, independent of other gases present. It is consistent with the fact that pressures add according to Pascal’s Principle. Thus water evaporates and ice sublimates when their vapor pressures exceed the partial pressure of water vapor in the surrounding mixture of gases. If their vapor pressures are less than the partial pressure of water vapor in the surrounding gas, liquid droplets or ice crystals (frost) form. Partial pressure Dalton’s law of partial pressures Check Your Understanding Is energy transfer involved in a phase change? If so, will energy have to be supplied to change phase from solid to liquid and liquid to gas? What about gas to liquid and liquid to solid? Why do they spray the orange trees with water in Florida when the temperatures are near or just below freezing? Solution Yes, energy transfer is involved in a phase change. We know that atoms and molecules in solids and liquids are bound to each other because we know that force is required to separate them. So in a phase change from solid to liquid and liquid to gas, a force must be exerted, perhaps by collision, to separate atoms and molecules. Force exerted through a distance is work, and energy is needed to do work to go from solid to liquid and liquid to gas. This is intuitively consistent with the need for energy to melt ice or boil water. The converse is also true. Going from gas to liquid or liquid to solid involves atoms and molecules pushing together, doing work and releasing energy.

Page 145,"Table 13.5 gives the vapor pressure of water at 20.0ºC20.0ºC as 2.33×103 Pa.2.33×103 Pa. Use the ideal gas law to calculate the density of water vapor in g/m3g/m3 that would create a partial pressure equal to this vapor pressure. Compare the result with the saturation vapor density given in the table. 20.0ºC20.0ºC 2.33×103 Pa.2.33×103 Pa. g/m3g/m3 To solve this problem, we need to break it down into a two steps. The partial pressure follows the ideal gas law, 13.70 where nn is the number of moles. If we solve this equation for n/Vn/V to calculate the number of moles per cubic meter, we can then convert this quantity to grams per cubic meter as requested. To do this, we need to use the molecular mass of water, which is given in the periodic table. nn n/Vn/V 1. Identify the knowns and convert them to the proper units: 2. Solve the ideal gas law for n/Vn/V. n/Vn/V 13.71 3. Substitute known values into the equation and solve for n/Vn/V. n/Vn/V 13.72 4. Convert the density in moles per cubic meter to grams per cubic meter. 13.73 The density is obtained by assuming a pressure equal to the vapor pressure of water at 20.0ºC20.0ºC. The density found is identical to the value in Table 13.5,  which means that a vapor density of 17.2 g/m317.2 g/m3 at 20.0ºC20.0ºC creates a partial pressure of 2.33×103 Pa,2.33×103 Pa, equal to the vapor pressure of water at that temperature. If the partial pressure is equal to the vapor pressure, then the liquid and vapor phases are in equilibrium, and the relative humidity is 100%. Thus, there can be no more than 17.2 g of water vapor per m3m3 at 20.0ºC20.0ºC, so that this value is the saturation vapor density at that temperature. This example illustrates how water vapor behaves like an ideal gas: the pressure and density are consistent with the ideal gas law (assuming the density in the table is correct). The saturation vapor densities listed in Table 13.5 are the maximum amounts of water vapor that air can hold at various temperatures. 20.0ºC20.0ºC 17.2 g/m317.2 g/m3 20.0ºC20.0ºC 2.33×103 Pa,2.33×103 Pa, m3m3 20.0ºC20.0ºC"
Page 145,"Solution Decreased the atmospheric pressure results in decreased partial pressure of water, hence a lower humidity. So evaporation of water from food, for example, will be enhanced. The molecules of water most likely to break away from the food will be those with the greatest velocities. Those remaining thus have a lower average velocity and a lower temperature. This can (and does) result in the freezing and drying of the food; hence the process is aptly named freeze drying."

Page 151,"It is also possible to change the temperature of a substance by doing work. Work can transfer energy into or out of a system. This realization helped establish the fact that heat is a form of energy. James Prescott Joule (1818–1889) performed many experiments to establish the mechanical equivalent of heat—the work needed to produce the same effects as heat transfer. In terms of the units used for these two terms, the best modern value for this equivalence is mechanical equivalent of heat 14.1 We consider this equation as the conversion between two different units of energy. Figure 14.3 Schematic depiction of Joule’s experiment that established the equivalence of heat and work. The figure above shows one of Joule’s most famous experimental setups for demonstrating the mechanical equivalent of heat. It demonstrated that work and heat can produce the same effects, and helped establish the principle of conservation of energy. Gravitational potential energy (PE) (work done by the gravitational force) is converted into kinetic energy (KE), and then randomized by viscosity and turbulence into increased average kinetic energy of atoms and molecules in the system, producing a temperature increase. His contributions to the field of thermodynamics were so significant that the SI unit of energy was named after him. Heat added or removed from a system changes its internal energy and thus its temperature. Such a temperature increase is observed while cooking. However, adding heat does not necessarily increase the temperature. An example is melting of ice; that is, when a substance changes from one phase to another. Work done on the system or by the system can also change the internal energy of the system. Joule demonstrated that the temperature of a system can be increased by stirring. If an ice cube is rubbed against a rough surface, work is done by the frictional force. A system has a well-defined internal energy, but we cannot say that it has a certain “heat content” or “work content”. We use the phrase “heat transfer” to emphasize its nature. Check Your Understanding Two samples (A and B) of the same substance are kept in a lab. Someone adds 10 kilojoules (kJ) of heat to one sample, while 10 kJ of work is done on the other sample. How can you tell to which sample the heat was added? Solution Heat and work both change the internal energy of the substance. However, the properties of the sample only depend on the internal energy so that it is impossible to tell whether heat was added to sample A or B."

Heat is transferred from the soda to the ice for melting. Melting of ice occurs in two steps: first the phase change occurs and solid (ice) transforms into liquid water at the melting temperature, then the temperature of this water rises. Melting yields water at 0ºC0ºC, so more heat is transferred from the soda to this water until the water plus soda system reaches thermal equilibrium, 0ºC0ºC 0ºC0ºC 14.19 The heat transferred to the ice is Qice=miceLf+micecW(Tf−0ºC)Qice=miceLf+micecW(Tf−0ºC).

You may assume most of the kinetic energy of the airplane is converted to thermal energy in the brakes and surrounding materials, and that little escapes. Note that the brakes are expected to become so hot in this procedure that they ignite and, in order to pass the test, the airplane must be able to withstand the fire for some time without a general conflagration. 81 .

Make the initial circumstances such that at rest the person will have a net heat transfer and then decide how much physical activity of a chosen type is necessary to balance the rate of heat transfer. Among the things to consider are the size of the person, type of clothing, initial metabolic rate, sky conditions, amount of water evaporated, and volume of air breathed.

Page 163,"The first law of thermodynamics is actually the law of conservation of energy stated in a form most useful in thermodynamics. The first law gives the relationship between heat transfer, work done, and the change in internal energy of a system."
Page 163,"Heat transfer (QQ) and doing work (WW) are the two everyday means of bringing energy into or taking energy out of a system. The processes are quite different. Heat transfer, a less organized process, is driven by temperature differences. Work, a quite organized process, involves a macroscopic force exerted through a distance. Nevertheless, heat and work can produce identical results.For example, both can cause a temperature increase. Heat transfer into a system, such as when the Sun warms the air in a bicycle tire, can increase its temperature, and so can work done on the system, as when the bicyclist pumps air into the tire. Once the temperature increase has occurred, it is impossible to tell whether it was caused by heat transfer or by doing work. This uncertainty is an important point. Heat transfer and work are both energy in transit—neither is stored as such in a system. However, both can change the internal energy UU of a system. Internal energy is a form of energy completely different from either heat or work. QQ WW UU"
Page 163,"We can think about the internal energy of a system in two different but consistent ways. The first is the atomic and molecular view, which examines the system on the atomic and molecular scale. The internal energy UU of a system is the sum of the kinetic and potential energies of its atoms and molecules. Recall that kinetic plus potential energy is called mechanical energy. Thus internal energy is the sum of atomic and molecular mechanical energy. Because it is impossible to keep track of all individual atoms and molecules, we must deal with averages and distributions. A second way to view the internal energy of a system is in terms of its macroscopic characteristics, which are very similar to atomic and molecular average values. internal energy UU Macroscopically, we define the change in internal energy ΔUΔU to be that given by the first law of thermodynamics: ΔUΔU 15.2 Many detailed experiments have verified that ΔU=Q−WΔU=Q−W, where ΔUΔU is the change in total kinetic and potential energy of all atoms and molecules in a system. It has also been determined experimentally that the internal energy UU of a system depends only on the state of the system and not how it reached that state. More specifically, UU is found to be a function of a few macroscopic quantities (pressure, volume, and temperature, for example), independent of past history such as whether there has been heat transfer or work done. This independence means that if we know the state of a system, we can calculate changes in its internal energy UU from a few macroscopic variables. ΔU=Q−WΔU=Q−W ΔUΔU UU UU UU Making Connections: Macroscopic and Microscopic In thermodynamics, we often use the macroscopic picture when making calculations of how a system behaves, while the atomic and molecular picture gives underlying explanations in terms of averages and distributions. We shall see this again in later sections of this chapter. For example, in the topic of entropy, calculations will be made using the atomic and molecular view. To get a better idea of how to think about the internal energy of a system, let us examine a system going from State 1 to State 2. The system has internal energy U1U1 in State 1, and it has internal energy U2U2 in State 2, no matter how it got to either state. So the change in internal energy ΔU=U2−U1ΔU=U2−U1 is independent of what caused the change. In other words, ΔUΔU is independent of path. By path, we mean the method of getting from the starting point to the ending point. Why is this independence important? Note that ΔU=Q−WΔU=Q−W. Both QQ and WWdepend on path, but ΔUΔU does not. This path independence means that internal energy UU is easier to consider than either heat transfer or work done. U1U1 U2U2 ΔU=U2−U1ΔU=U2−U1 ΔUΔU ΔU=Q−WΔU=Q−W QQ WW ΔUΔU UU Example 15.1 (a) Suppose there is heat transfer of 40.00 J to a system, while the system does 10.00 J of work. Later, there is heat transfer of 25.00 J out of the system while 4.00 J of work is done on the system. What is the net change in internal energy of the system? (b) What is the change in internal energy of a system when a total of 150.00 J of heat transfer occurs out of (from) the system and 159.00 J of work is done on the system? (See Figure 15.4). In part (a), we must first find the net heat transfer and net work done from the given information. Then the first law of thermodynamics (ΔU=Q−W)(ΔU=Q−W) can be used to find the change in internal energy. In part (b), the net heat transfer and work done are given, so the equation can be used directly. (ΔU=Q−W)(ΔU=Q−W) The net heat transfer is the heat transfer into the system minus the heat transfer out of the system, or 15.3 Similarly, the total work is the work done by the system minus the work done on the system, or 15.4 Thus the change in internal energy is given by the first law of thermodynamics: 15.5 We can also find the change in internal energy for each of the two steps. First, consider 40.00 J of heat transfer in and 10.00 J of work out, or 15.6 Now consider 25.00 J of heat transfer out and 4.00 J of work in, or 15.7 The total change is the sum of these two steps, or 15.8 No matter whether you look at the overall process or break it into steps, the change in internal energy is the same. Here the net heat transfer and total work are given directly to be Q=–150.00 JQ=–150.00 J and W=–159.00 JW=–159.00 J, so that Q=–150.00 JQ=–150.00 J W=–159.00 JW=–159.00 J 15.9 A very different process in part (b) produces the same 9.00-J change in internal energy as in part (a). Note that the change in the system in both parts is related to ΔUΔU and not to the individual QQs or WWs involved. The system ends up in the same state in both (a) and (b). Parts (a) and (b) present two different paths for the system to follow between the same starting and ending points, and the change in internal energy for each is the same—it is independent of path. ΔUΔU QQ WW Figure 15.4 Two different processes produce the same change in a system. (a) A total of 15.00 J of heat transfer occurs into the system, while work takes out a total of 6.00 J. The change in internal energy is ΔU=Q−W=9.00 JΔU=Q−W=9.00 J. (b) Heat transfer removes 150.00 J from the system while work puts 159.00 J into it, producing an increase of 9.00 J in internal energy. If the system starts out in the same state in (a) and (b), it will end up in the same final state in either case—its final state is related to internal energy, not how that energy was acquired. Human metabolism is the conversion of food into heat transfer, work, and stored fat. Metabolism is an interesting example of the first law of thermodynamics in action. We now take another look at these topics via the first law of thermodynamics. Considering the body as the system of interest, we can use the first law to examine heat transfer, doing work, and internal energy in activities ranging from sleep to heavy exercise. What are some of the major characteristics of heat transfer, doing work, and energy in the body? For one, body temperature is normally kept constant by heat transfer to the surroundings. This means QQ is negative. Another fact is that the body usually does work on the outside world. This means WW is positive. In such situations, then, the body loses internal energy, since ΔU=Q−WΔU=Q−W is negative. Human metabolism QQ WW ΔU=Q−WΔU=Q−W Now consider the effects of eating. Eating increases the internal energy of the body by adding chemical potential energy (this is an unromantic view of a good steak). The body metabolizes all the food we consume. Basically, metabolism is an oxidation process in which the chemical potential energy of food is released. This implies that food input is in the form of work. Food energy is reported in a special unit, known as the Calorie. This energy is measured by burning food in a calorimeter, which is how the units are determined. In chemistry and biochemistry, one calorie (spelled with a lowercase c) is defined as the energy (or heat transfer) required to raise the temperature of one gram of pure water by one degree Celsius.  Nutritionists and weight-watchers tend to use the dietary calorie, which is frequently called a Calorie (spelled with a capital C). One food Calorie is the energy needed to raise the temperature of one kilogram of water by one degree Celsius. This means that one dietary Calorie is equal to one kilocalorie for the chemist, and one must be careful to avoid confusion between the two. Again, consider the internal energy the body has lost. There are three places this internal energy can go—to heat transfer, to doing work, and to stored fat (a tiny fraction also goes to cell repair and growth). Heat transfer and doing work take internal energy out of the body, and food puts it back. If you eat just the right amount of food, then your average internal energy remains constant. Whatever you lose to heat transfer and doing work is replaced by food, so that, in the long run, ΔU=0ΔU=0. If you overeat repeatedly, then ΔUΔU is always positive, and your body stores this extra internal energy as fat. The reverse is true if you eat too little. If ΔUΔU is negative for a few days, then the body metabolizes its own fat to maintain body temperature and do work that takes energy from the body. This process is how dieting produces weight loss. ΔU=0ΔU=0 ΔUΔU ΔUΔU Life is not always this simple, as any dieter knows. The body stores fat or metabolizes it only if energy intake changes for a period of several days. Once you have been on a major diet, the next one is less successful because your body alters the way it responds to low energy intake. Your basal metabolic rate (BMR) is the rate at which food is converted into heat transfer and work done while the body is at complete rest. The body adjusts its basal metabolic rate to partially compensate for over-eating or under-eating. The body will decrease the metabolic rate rather than eliminate its own fat to replace lost food intake. You will chill more easily and feel less energetic as a result of the lower metabolic rate, and you will not lose weight as fast as before. Exercise helps to lose weight, because it produces both heat transfer from your body and work, and raises your metabolic rate even when you are at rest. Weight loss is also aided by the quite low efficiency of the body in converting internal energy to work, so that the loss of internal energy resulting from doing work is much greater than the work done.It should be noted, however, that living systems are not in thermalequilibrium. The body provides us with an excellent indication that many thermodynamic processes are irreversible. An irreversible process can go in one direction but not the reverse, under a given set of conditions. For example, although body fat can be converted to do work and produce heat transfer, work done on the body and heat transfer into it cannot be converted to body fat. Otherwise, we could skip lunch by sunning ourselves or by walking down stairs. Another example of an irreversible thermodynamic process is photosynthesis. This process is the intake of one form of energy—light—by plants and its conversion to chemical potential energy. Both applications of the first law of thermodynamics are illustrated in Figure 15.5. One great advantage of conservation laws such as the first law of thermodynamics is that they accurately describe the beginning and ending points of complex processes, such as metabolism and photosynthesis, without regard to the complications in between. Table 15.1 presents a summary of terms relevant to the first law of thermodynamics. Figure 15.5 (a) The first law of thermodynamics applied to metabolism. Heat transferred out of the body (QQ) and work done by the body (WW) remove internal energy, while food intake replaces it. (Food intake may be considered as work done on the body.)

W It is not surprising that W=PΔVW=PΔV, since we have already noted in our treatment of fluids that pressure is a type of potential energy per unit volume and that pressure in fact has units of energy divided by volume. We also noted in our discussion of the ideal gas law that PVPV has units of energy. In this case, some of the energy associated with pressure becomes work. W=PΔVW=PΔV PVPV Figure 15.10 shows a graph of pressure versus volume (that is, a PVPV diagram for an isobaric process. You can see in the figure that the work done is the area under the graph. This property of PVPV diagrams is very useful and broadly applicable: the work done on or by a system in going from one state to another equals the area under the curve on a PVPV diagram. PVPV PVPV PVPV Figure 15.10 A graph of pressure versus volume for a constant-pressure, or isobaric, process, such as the one shown in Figure 15.9. The area under the curve equals the work done by the gas, since W=PΔVW=PΔV. Figure 15.11 (a) A PVPV diagram in which pressure varies as well as volume. The work done for each interval is its average pressure times the change in volume, or the area under the curve over that interval. Thus the total area under the curve equals the total work done. (b) Work must be done on the system to follow the reverse path. This is interpreted as a negative area under the curve. We can see where this leads by considering Figure 15.11(a), which shows a more general process in which both pressure and volume change. The area under the curve is closely approximated by dividing it into strips, each having an average constant pressure Pi(ave)Pi(ave). The work done is Wi=Pi(ave)ΔViWi=Pi(ave)ΔVi for each strip, and the total work done is the sum of the WiWi. Thus the total work done is the total area under the curve. If the path is reversed, as in Figure 15.11(b), then work is done on the system. The area under the curve in that case is negative, because ΔVΔV is negative. Pi(ave)Pi(ave) Wi=Pi(ave)ΔViWi=Pi(ave)ΔVi WiWi ΔVΔV PVPV diagrams clearly illustrate that the work done depends on the path taken and not just the endpoints. This path dependence is seen in Figure 15.12(a), where more work is done in going from A to C by the path via point B than by the path via point D. The vertical paths, where volume is constant, are called isochoric processes. Since volume is constant, ΔV=0ΔV=0, and no work is done in an isochoric process. Now, if the system follows the cyclical path ABCDA, as in Figure 15.12(b), then the total work done is the area inside the loop. The negative area below path CD subtracts, leaving only the area inside the rectangle. In fact, the work done in any cyclical process (one that returns to its starting point) is the area inside the loop it forms on a PVPV diagram, as Figure 15.12(c) illustrates for a general cyclical process. Note that the loop must be traversed in the clockwise direction for work to be positive—that is, for there to be a net work output. PVPV isochoric ΔV=0ΔV=0 PVPV Figure 15.12 (a) The work done in going from A to C depends on path. The work is greater for the path ABC than for the path ADC, because the former is at higher pressure. In both cases, the work done is the area under the path. This area is greater for path ABC. (b) The total work done in the cyclical process ABCDA is the area inside the loop, since the negative area below CD subtracts out, leaving just the area inside the rectangle. (The values given for the pressures and the change in volume are intended for use in the example below.)  (c) The area inside any closed loop is the work done in the cyclical process. If the loop is traversed in a clockwise direction, WW is positive—it is work done on the outside environment. If the loop is traveled in a counter-clockwise direction, WW is negative—it is work that is done to the system."
Page 164,"Calculate the total work done in the cyclical process ABCDA shown in Figure 15.12(b) by the following two methods to verify that work equals the area inside the closed loop on the PVPV diagram. (Take the data in the figure to be precise to three significant figures.) (a) Calculate the work done along each segment of the path and add these values to get the total work. (b) Calculate the area inside the rectangle ABCDA. PVPV To find the work along any path on a PVPV diagram, you use the fact that work is pressure times change in volume, or W=PΔVW=PΔV. So in part (a), this value is calculated for each leg of the path around the closed loop. PVPV W=PΔVW=PΔV The work along path AB is 15.14 Since the path BC is isochoric, ΔVBC=0ΔVBC=0, and so WBC=0WBC=0. The work along path CD is negative, since ΔVCDΔVCD is negative (the volume decreases). The work is ΔVBC=0ΔVBC=0 WBC=0WBC=0 ΔVCDΔVCD 15.15 Again, since the path DA is isochoric, ΔVDA=0ΔVDA=0, and so WDA=0WDA=0. Now the total work is ΔVDA=0ΔVDA=0 WDA=0WDA=0 15.16 The area inside the rectangle is its height times its width, or 15.17 Thus, 15.18 The result, as anticipated, is that the area inside the closed loop equals the work done. The area is often easier to calculate than is the work done along each path. It is also convenient to visualize the area inside different curves on PVPV diagrams in order to see which processes might produce the most work. Recall that work can be done to the system, or by the system, depending on the sign of WW. A positive WW is work that is done by the system on the outside environment; a negative WW represents work done by the environment on the system. PVPV WW WW WW Figure 15.13(a) shows two other important processes on a PVPV diagram. For comparison, both are shown starting from the same point A. The upper curve ending at point B is an isothermal process—that is, one in which temperature is kept constant. If the gas behaves like an ideal gas, as is often the case, and if no phase change occurs, then PV=nRTPV=nRT. Since TT is constant, PVPV is a constant for an isothermal process. We ordinarily expect the temperature of a gas to decrease as it expands, and so we correctly suspect that heat transfer must occur from the surroundings to the gas to keep the temperature constant during an isothermal expansion. To show this more rigorously for the special case of a monatomic ideal gas, we note that the average kinetic energy of an atom in such a gas is given by PVPV isothermal PV=nRTPV=nRT TT PVPV 15.19 The kinetic energy of the atoms in a monatomic ideal gas is its only form of internal energy, and so its total internal energy UU is UU 15.20 where NN is the number of atoms in the gas. This relationship means that the internal energy of an ideal monatomic gas is constant during an isothermal process—that is, ΔU=0ΔU=0. If the internal energy does not change, then the net heat transfer into the gas must equal the net work done by the gas. That is, because ΔU=Q−W=0ΔU=Q−W=0 here, Q=WQ=W. We must have just enough heat transfer to replace the work done. An isothermal process is inherently slow, because heat transfer occurs continuously to keep the gas temperature constant at all times and must be allowed to spread through the gas so that there are no hot or cold regions. NN ΔU=0ΔU=0 ΔU=Q−W=0ΔU=Q−W=0 Q=WQ=W Note that diatomic gases, such as those in air, have different formulas for average kinetic energy of an atom and total internal energy. Also shown in Figure 15.13(a) is a curve AC for an adiabatic process, defined to be one in which there is no heat transfer—that is, Q=0Q=0. Processes that are nearly adiabatic can be achieved either by using very effective insulation or by performing the process so fast that there is little time for heat transfer. Temperature must decrease during an adiabatic expansion process, since work is done at the expense of internal energy: adiabatic Q=0Q=0 15.21 (You might have noted that a gas released into atmospheric pressure from a pressurized cylinder is substantially colder than the gas in the cylinder.) In fact, because Q=0, ΔU=–WQ=0, ΔU=–W for an adiabatic process. Lower temperature results in lower pressure along the way, so that curve AC is lower than curve AB, and less work is done. If the path ABCA could be followed by cooling the gas from B to C at constant volume (isochorically), Figure 15.13(b), there would be a net work output. Q=0, ΔU=–WQ=0, ΔU=–W Figure 15.13 (a) The upper curve is an isothermal process (ΔT=0ΔT=0), whereas the lower curve is an adiabatic process (Q=0Q=0). Both start from the same point A, but the isothermal process does more work than the adiabatic because heat transfer into the gas takes place to keep its temperature constant. This keeps the pressure higher all along the isothermal path than along the adiabatic path, producing more work. The adiabatic path thus ends up with a lower pressure and temperature at point C, even though the final volume is the same as for the isothermal process. (b) The cycle ABCA produces a net work output."
Page 164,"Both isothermal and adiabatic processes such as shown in Figure 15.13 are reversible in principle. A reversible process is one in which both the system and its environment can return to exactly the states they were in by following the reverse path. The reverse isothermal and adiabatic paths are BA and CA, respectively. Real macroscopic processes are never exactly reversible. In the previous examples, our system is a gas (like that in Figure 15.9), and its environment is the piston, cylinder, and the rest of the universe. If there are any energy-dissipating mechanisms, such as friction or turbulence, then heat transfer to the environment occurs for either direction of the piston. So, for example, if the path BA is followed and there is friction, then the gas will be returned to its original state but the environment will not—it will have been heated in both directions. Reversibility requires the direction of heat transfer to reverse for the reverse path. Since dissipative mechanisms cannot be completely eliminated, real processes cannot be reversible. reversible process There must be reasons that real macroscopic processes cannot be reversible. We can imagine them going in reverse. For example, heat transfer occurs spontaneously from hot to cold and never spontaneously the reverse. Yet it would not violate the first law of thermodynamics for this to happen. In fact, all spontaneous processes, such as bubbles bursting, never go in reverse. There is a second thermodynamic law that forbids them from going in reverse. When we study this law, we will learn something about nature and also find that such a law limits the efficiency of heat engines. We will find that heat engines with the greatest possible theoretical efficiency would have to use reversible processes, and even they cannot convert all heat transfer into doing work. Table 15.2 summarizes the simpler thermodynamic processes and their definitions. Table 15.2 Summary of Simple Thermodynamic Processes"
Page 165,"By the end of this section, you will be able to:"
Page 165,Heat transfer occurs spontaneously from higher- to lower-temperature bodies but never spontaneously in the reverse direction.
Page 165,"Now let us consider a device that uses heat transfer to do work. As noted in the previous section, such a device is called a heat engine, and one is shown schematically in Figure 15.16(b). Gasoline and diesel engines, jet engines, and steam turbines are all heat engines that do work by using part of the heat transfer from some source. Heat transfer from the hot object (or hot reservoir) is denoted as QhQh, while heat transfer into the cold object (or cold reservoir) is QcQc, and the work done by the engine is WW. The temperatures of the hot and cold reservoirs are ThTh and TcTc, respectively. QhQh QcQc WW ThTh TcTc Figure 15.16 (a) Heat transfer occurs spontaneously from a hot object to a cold one, consistent with the second law of thermodynamics. (b) A heat engine, represented here by a circle, uses part of the heat transfer to do work. The hot and cold objects are called the hot and cold reservoirs. QhQh is the heat transfer out of the hot reservoir, WW is the work output, and QcQc is the heat transfer into the cold reservoir. Because the hot reservoir is heated externally, which is energy intensive, it is important that the work is done as efficiently as possible. In fact, we would like WW to equal QhQh, and for there to be no heat transfer to the environment (Qc=0Qc=0). Unfortunately, this is impossible. The second law of thermodynamics also states, with regard to using heat transfer to do work (the second expression of the second law): WW QhQh Qc=0Qc=0 second law of thermodynamics The Second Law of Thermodynamics (second expression) It is impossible in any system for heat transfer from a reservoir to completely convert to work in a cyclical process in which the system returns to its initial state. A cyclical process brings a system, such as the gas in a cylinder, back to its original state at the end of every cycle. Most heat engines, such as reciprocating piston engines and rotating turbines, use cyclical processes. The second law, just stated in its second form, clearly states that such engines cannot have perfect conversion of heat transfer into work done. Before going into the underlying reasons for the limits on converting heat transfer into work, we need to explore the relationships among WW, QhQh, and QcQc, and to define the efficiency of a cyclical heat engine. As noted, a cyclical process brings the system back to its original condition at the end of every cycle. Such a system’s internal energy UU is the same at the beginning and end of every cycle—that is, ΔU=0ΔU=0. The first law of thermodynamics states that cyclical process WW QhQh QcQc UU ΔU=0ΔU=0 15.22 where QQ is the net heat transfer during the cycle (Q=Qh−QcQ=Qh−Qc) and WW is the net work done by the system. Since ΔU=0ΔU=0 for a complete cycle, we have QQ Q=Qh−QcQ=Qh−Qc WW ΔU=0ΔU=0 15.23 so that 15.24 Thus the net work done by the system equals the net heat transfer into the system, or 15.25 just as shown schematically in Figure 15.16(b). The problem is that in all processes, there is some heat transfer QcQc to the environment—and usually a very significant amount at that. QcQc In the conversion of energy to work, we are always faced with the problem of getting less out than we put in. We define conversion efficiency EffEff to be the ratio of useful work output to the energy input (or, in other words, the ratio of what we get to what we spend). In that spirit, we define the efficiency of a heat engine to be its net work output WW divided by heat transfer to the engine QhQh; that is, EffEff WW QhQh 15.26 Since W=Qh−QcW=Qh−Qc in a cyclical process, we can also express this as W=Qh−QcW=Qh−Qc 15.27 making it clear that an efficiency of 1, or 100%, is possible only if there is no heat transfer to the environment (Qc=0Qc=0). Note that all QQs are positive. The direction of heat transfer is indicated by a plus or minus sign. For example, QcQc is out of the system and so is preceded by a minus sign. Qc=0Qc=0 QQ QcQc Example 15.3 A coal-fired power station is a huge heat engine. It uses heat transfer from burning coal to do work to turn turbines, which are used to generate electricity. In a single day, a large coal power station has 2.50×1014J2.50×1014J of heat transfer from coal and 1.48×1014J1.48×1014J of heat transfer into the environment. (a) What is the work done by the power station? (b) What is the efficiency of the power station? (c) In the combustion process, the following chemical reaction occurs: C+O2→CO2C+O2→CO2. This implies that every 12 kg of coal puts 12 kg + 16 kg + 16 kg = 44 kg of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Assuming that 1 kg of coal can provide 2.5×106J2.5×106J of heat transfer upon combustion, how much CO2CO2 is emitted per day by this power plant? 2.50×1014J2.50×1014J 1.48×1014J1.48×1014J C+O2→CO2C+O2→CO2 2.5×106J2.5×106J CO2CO2 We can use W=Qh−QcW=Qh−Qc to find the work output WW, assuming a cyclical process is used in the power station. In this process, water is boiled under pressure to form high-temperature steam, which is used to run steam turbine-generators, and then condensed back to water to start the cycle again. W=Qh−QcW=Qh−Qc WW Work output is given by: 15.28 Substituting the given values: 15.29 The efficiency can be calculated with Eff=WQhEff=WQh since QhQh is given and work WW was found in the first part of this example.

J QhQh 15.30 The daily consumption of coal is calculated using the information that each day there is 2.50×1014 J2.50×1014 J of heat transfer from coal. In the combustion process, we have C+O2→CO2C+O2→CO2. So every 12 kg of coal puts 12 kg + 16 kg + 16 kg = 44 kg of CO2CO2 into the atmosphere. 2.50×1014 J2.50×1014 J C+O2→CO2C+O2→CO2 CO2CO2 The daily coal consumption is 15.31 Assuming that the coal is pure and that all the coal goes toward producing carbon dioxide, the carbon dioxide produced per day is 15.32 This is 370,000 metric tons of CO2CO2 produced every day. CO2CO2 If all the work output is converted to electricity in a period of one day, the average power output is 1180 MW (this is left to you as an end-of-chapter problem). This value is about the size of a large-scale conventional power plant. The efficiency found is acceptably close to the value of 42% given for coal power stations. It means that fully 59.2% of the energy is heat transfer to the environment, which usually results in warming lakes, rivers, or the ocean near the power station, and is implicated in a warming planet generally. While the laws of thermodynamics limit the efficiency of such plants—including plants fired by nuclear fuel, oil, and natural gas—the heat transfer to the environment could be, and sometimes is, used for heating homes or for industrial processes. The generally low cost of energy has not made it economical to make better use of the waste heat transfer from most heat engines. Coal-fired power plants produce the greatest amount of CO2CO2 per unit energy output (compared to natural gas or oil), making coal the least efficient fossil fuel. CO2CO2 With the information given in Example 15.3, we can find characteristics such as the efficiency of a heat engine without any knowledge of how the heat engine operates, but looking further into the mechanism of the engine will give us greater insight. Figure 15.17 illustrates the operation of the common four-stroke gasoline engine. The four steps shown complete this heat engine’s cycle, bringing the gasoline-air mixture back to its original condition. The Otto cycle shown in Figure 15.18(a) is used in four-stroke internal combustion engines, although in fact the true Otto cycle paths do not correspond exactly to the strokes of the engine. Otto cycle The adiabatic process AB corresponds to the nearly adiabatic compression stroke of the gasoline engine. In both cases, work is done on the system (the gas mixture in the cylinder), increasing its temperature and pressure. Along path BC of the Otto cycle, heat transfer QhQh into the gas occurs at constant volume, causing a further increase in pressure and temperature. This process corresponds to burning fuel in an internal combustion engine, and takes place so rapidly that the volume is nearly constant. Path CD in the Otto cycle is an adiabatic expansion that does work on the outside world, just as the power stroke of an internal combustion engine does in its nearly adiabatic expansion. The work done by the system along path CD is greater than the work done on the system along path AB, because the pressure is greater, and so there is a net work output. Along path DA in the Otto cycle, heat transfer QcQc from the gas at constant volume reduces its temperature and pressure, returning it to its original state. In an internal combustion engine, this process corresponds to the exhaust of hot gases and the intake of an air-gasoline mixture at a considerably lower temperature. In both cases, heat transfer into the environment occurs along this final path. QhQh QcQc The net work done by a cyclical process is the area inside the closed path on a PVPV diagram, such as that inside path ABCDA in Figure 15.18. Note that in every imaginable cyclical process, it is absolutely necessary for heat transfer from the system to occur in order to get a net work output. In the Otto cycle, heat transfer occurs along path DA. If no heat transfer occurs, then the return path is the same, and the net work output is zero. The lower the temperature on the path AB, the less work has to be done to compress the gas. The area inside the closed path is then greater, and so the engine does more work and is thus more efficient. Similarly, the higher the temperature along path CD, the more work output there is. (See Figure 15.19.) So efficiency is related to the temperatures of the hot and cold reservoirs. In the next section, we shall see what the absolute limit to the efficiency of a heat engine is, and how it is related to temperature. PVPV Figure 15.17 In the four-stroke internal combustion gasoline engine, heat transfer into work takes place in the cyclical process shown here. The piston is connected to a rotating crankshaft, which both takes work out of and does work on the gas in the cylinder. (a) Air is mixed with fuel during the intake stroke. (b) During the compression stroke, the air-fuel mixture is rapidly compressed in a nearly adiabatic process, as the piston rises with the valves closed. Work is done on the gas. (c) The power stroke has two distinct parts. First, the air-fuel mixture is ignited, converting chemical potential energy into thermal energy almost instantaneously, which leads to a great increase in pressure. Then the piston descends, and the gas does work by exerting a force through a distance in a nearly adiabatic process. (d) The exhaust stroke expels the hot gas to prepare the engine for another cycle, starting again with the intake stroke. Figure 15.18 PVPV diagram for a simplified Otto cycle, analogous to that employed in an internal combustion engine. Point A corresponds to the start of the compression stroke of an internal combustion engine. Paths AB and CD are adiabatic and correspond to the compression and power strokes of an internal combustion engine, respectively. Paths BC and DA are isochoric and accomplish similar results to the ignition and exhaust-intake portions, respectively, of the internal combustion engine’s cycle. Work is done on the gas along path AB, but more work is done by the gas along path CD, so that there is a net work output. Figure 15.19 This Otto cycle produces a greater work output than the one in Figure 15.18, because the starting temperature of path CD is higher and the starting temperature of path AB is lower. The area inside the loop is greater, corresponding to greater net work output."

Page 167,"The great advantage of using a heat pump to keep your home warm, rather than just burning fuel, is that a heat pump supplies Qh=Qc+WQh=Qc+W. Heat transfer is from the outside air, even at a temperature below freezing, to the indoor space. You only pay for WW, and you get an additional heat transfer of QcQc from the outside at no cost; in many cases, at least twice as much energy is transferred to the heated space as is used to run the heat pump. When you burn fuel to keep warm, you pay for all of it. The disadvantage is that the work input (required by the second law of thermodynamics) is sometimes more expensive than simply burning fuel, especially if the work is done by electrical energy. Qh=Qc+WQh=Qc+W WW QcQc The basic components of a heat pump in its heating mode are shown in Figure 15.27. A working fluid such as a non-CFC refrigerant is used. In the outdoor coils (the evaporator), heat transfer QcQc occurs to the working fluid from the cold outdoor air, turning it into a gas. QcQc Figure 15.27 A simple heat pump has four basic components: (1) condenser, (2) expansion valve, (3) evaporator, and (4) compressor. In the heating mode, heat transfer QcQc occurs to the working fluid in the evaporator (3) from the colder outdoor air, turning it into a gas. The electrically driven compressor (4) increases the temperature and pressure of the gas and forces it into the condenser coils (1) inside the heated space. Because the temperature of the gas is higher than the temperature in the room, heat transfer from the gas to the room occurs as the gas condenses to a liquid. The working fluid is then cooled as it flows back through an expansion valve (2) to the outdoor evaporator coils. The electrically driven compressor (work input WW) raises the temperature and pressure of the gas and forces it into the condenser coils that are inside the heated space. Because the temperature of the gas is higher than the temperature inside the room, heat transfer to the room occurs and the gas condenses to a liquid. The liquid then flows back through a pressure-reducing valve to the outdoor evaporator coils, being cooled through expansion. (In a cooling cycle, the evaporator and condenser coils exchange roles and the flow direction of the fluid is reversed.) WW The quality of a heat pump is judged by how much heat transfer QhQh occurs into the warm space compared with how much work input WW is required. In the spirit of taking the ratio of what you get to what you spend, we define a heat pump’s coefficient of performance (COPhpCOPhp) to be QhQh WW heat pump’s coefficient of performance COPhpCOPhp 15.37 Since the efficiency of a heat engine is Eff=W/QhEff=W/Qh, we see that COPhp=1/EffCOPhp=1/Eff, an important and interesting fact. First, since the efficiency of any heat engine is less than 1, it means that COPhpCOPhp is always greater than 1—that is, a heat pump always has more heat transfer QhQh than work put into it. Second, it means that heat pumps work best when temperature differences are small. The efficiency of a perfect, or Carnot, engine is EffC=1−Tc/ThEffC=1−Tc/Th; thus, the smaller the temperature difference, the smaller the efficiency and the greater the COPhpCOPhp (because COPhp=1/EffCOPhp=1/Eff). In other words, heat pumps do not work as well in very cold climates as they do in more moderate climates. Eff=W/QhEff=W/Qh COPhp=1/EffCOPhp=1/Eff COPhpCOPhp QhQh EffC=1−Tc/ThEffC=1−Tc/Th COPhpCOPhp COPhp=1/EffCOPhp=1/Eff Friction and other irreversible processes reduce heat engine efficiency, but they do not benefit the operation of a heat pump—instead, they reduce the work input by converting part of it to heat transfer back into the cold reservoir before it gets into the heat pump.

  to the cold reservoir. If all of WW had gone into the heat pump, then QhQh would have been greater. The best heat pump uses adiabatic and isothermal processes, since, in theory, there would be no dissipative processes to reduce the heat transfer to the hot reservoir. Example 15.5 A heat pump used to warm a home must employ a cycle that produces a working fluid at temperatures greater than typical indoor temperature so that heat transfer to the inside can take place. Similarly, it must produce a working fluid at temperatures that are colder than the outdoor temperature so that heat transfer occurs from outside. Its hot and cold reservoir temperatures therefore cannot be too close, placing a limit on its COPhpCOPhp. (See Figure 15.29.) What is the best coefficient of performance possible for such a heat pump, if it has a hot reservoir temperature of 45.0ºC45.0ºC and a cold reservoir temperature of −15.0ºC−15.0ºC? COPhpCOPhp 45.0ºC45.0ºC −15.0ºC−15.0ºC A Carnot engine reversed will give the best possible performance as a heat pump. As noted above, COPhp=1/EffCOPhp=1/Eff, so that we need to first calculate the Carnot efficiency to solve this problem. COPhp=1/EffCOPhp=1/Eff Carnot efficiency in terms of absolute temperature is given by: 15.38 The temperatures in kelvins are Th=318 KTh=318 K and Tc=258 KTc=258 K, so that Th=318 KTh=318 K Tc=258 KTc=258 K 15.39 Thus, from the discussion above, 15.40 or 15.41 so that 15.42 This result means that the heat transfer by the heat pump is 5.30 times as much as the work put into it. It would cost 5.30 times as much for the same heat transfer by an electric room heater as it does for that produced by this heat pump. This is not a violation of conservation of energy. Cold ambient air provides 4.3 J per 1 J of work from the electrical outlet. Figure 15.29 Heat transfer from the outside to the inside, along with work done to run the pump, takes place in the heat pump of the example above. Note that the cold temperature produced by the heat pump is lower than the outside temperature, so that heat transfer into the working fluid occurs. The pump’s compressor produces a temperature greater than the indoor temperature in order for heat transfer into the house to occur. Real heat pumps do not perform quite as well as the ideal one in the previous example; their values of COPhpCOPhp range from about 2 to 4. This range means that the heat transfer QhQh from the heat pumps is 2 to 4 times as great as the work WW put into them. Their economical feasibility is still limited, however, since WW is usually supplied by electrical energy that costs more per joule than heat transfer by burning fuels like natural gas. Furthermore, the initial cost of a heat pump is greater than that of many furnaces, so that a heat pump must last longer for its cost to be recovered. Heat pumps are most likely to be economically superior where winter temperatures are mild, electricity is relatively cheap, and other fuels are relatively expensive. Also, since they can cool as well as heat a space, they have advantages where cooling in summer months is also desired. Thus some of the best locations for heat pumps are in warm summer climates with cool winters. Figure 15.30 shows a heat pump, called a “reverse cycle” or “split-system cooler”  in some countries. COPhpCOPhp QhQh WW WW Figure 15.30 In hot weather, heat transfer occurs from air inside the room to air outside, cooling the room. In cool weather, heat transfer occurs from air outside to air inside, warming the room. This switching is achieved by reversing the direction of flow of the working fluid."

Page 167,"Air conditioners and refrigerators are designed to cool something down in a warm environment. As with heat pumps, work input is required for heat transfer from cold to hot, and this is expensive. The quality of air conditioners and refrigerators is judged by how much heat transfer QcQc occurs from a cold environment compared with how much work input WW is required. What is considered the benefit in a heat pump is considered waste heat in a refrigerator. We thus define the coefficient of performance (COPref)(COPref) of an air conditioner or refrigerator to be QcQc WW coefficient of performance (COPref)(COPref) 15.43 Noting again that Qh=Qc+WQh=Qc+W, we can see that an air conditioner will have a lower coefficient of performance than a heat pump, because COPhp=Qh/WCOPhp=Qh/W and QhQh is greater than QcQc. In this module’s Problems and Exercises, you will show that Qh=Qc+WQh=Qc+W COPhp=Qh/WCOPhp=Qh/W QhQh QcQc 15.44 for a heat engine used as either an air conditioner or a heat pump operating between the same two temperatures. Real air conditioners and refrigerators typically do remarkably well, having values of COPrefCOPref ranging from 2 to 6.

Page 168,"Recall that the simple definition of energy is the ability to do work. Entropy is a measure of how much energy is not available to do work. Although all forms of energy are interconvertible, and all can be used to do work, it is not always possible, even in principle, to convert the entire available energy into work. That unavailable energy is of interest in thermodynamics, because the field of thermodynamics arose from efforts to convert heat to work."
Page 168,"What does a change in entropy mean, and why should we be interested in it? One reason is that entropy is directly related to the fact that not all heat transfer can be converted into work. The next example gives some indication of how an increase in entropy results in less heat transfer into work. Example 15.7 (a) Calculate the work output of a Carnot engine operating between temperatures of 600 K and 100 K for 4000 J of heat transfer to the engine. (b) Now suppose that the 4000 J of heat transfer occurs first from the 600 K reservoir to a 250 K reservoir (without doing any work, and this produces the increase in entropy calculated above) before transferring into a Carnot engine operating between 250 K and 100 K. What work output is produced? (See Figure 15.34.) In both parts, we must first calculate the Carnot efficiency and then the work output. The Carnot efficiency is given by 15.53 Substituting the given temperatures yields 15.54 Now the work output can be calculated using the definition of efficiency for any heat engine as given by 15.55 Solving for WW and substituting known terms gives WW 15.56 Similarly, 15.57 so that 15.58 There is 933 J less work from the same heat transfer in the second process. This result is important. The same heat transfer into two perfect engines produces different work outputs, because the entropy change differs in the two cases. In the second case, entropy is greater and less work is produced. Entropy is associated with the unavailability of energy to do work. Figure 15.34 (a) A Carnot engine working at between 600 K and 100 K has 4000 J of heat transfer and performs 3333 J of work. (b) The 4000 J of heat transfer occurs first irreversibly to a 250 K reservoir and then goes into a Carnot engine. The increase in entropy caused by the heat transfer to a colder reservoir results in a smaller work output of 2400 J. There is a permanent loss of 933 J of energy for the purpose of doing work. When entropy increases, a certain amount of energy becomes permanently unavailable to do work. The energy is not lost, but its character is changed, so that some of it can never be converted to doing work—that is, to an organized force acting through a distance. For instance, in the previous example, 933 J less work was done after an increase in entropy of 9.33 J/K occurred in the 4000 J heat transfer from the 600 K reservoir to the 250 K reservoir. It can be shown that the amount of energy that becomes unavailable for work is 15.59 where T0T0 is the lowest temperature utilized. In the previous example, T0T0 15.60 as found."
Page 168,"In the early, energetic universe, all matter and energy were easily interchangeable and identical in nature. Gravity played a vital role in the young universe. Although it may have seemed disorderly, and therefore, superficially entropic, in fact, there was enormous potential energy available to do work—all the future energy in the universe. As the universe matured, temperature differences arose, which created more opportunity for work. Stars are hotter than planets, for example, which are warmer than icy asteroids, which are warmer still than the vacuum of the space between them. Most of these are cooling down from their usually violent births, at which time they were provided with energy of their own—nuclear energy in the case of stars, volcanic energy on Earth and other planets, and so on. Without additional energy input, however, their days are numbered. As entropy increases, less and less energy in the universe is available to do work. On Earth, we still have great stores of energy such as fossil and nuclear fuels; large-scale temperature differences, which can provide wind energy; geothermal energies due to differences in temperature in Earth’s layers; and tidal energies owing to our abundance of liquid water. As these are used, a certain fraction of the energy they contain can never be converted into doing work. Eventually, all fuels will be exhausted, all temperatures will equalize, and it will be impossible for heat engines to function, or for work to be done. Entropy increases in a closed system, such as the universe. But in parts of the universe, for instance, in the Solar system, it is not a locally closed system. Energy flows from the Sun to the planets, replenishing Earth’s stores of energy. The Sun will continue to supply us with energy for about another five billion years. We will enjoy direct solar energy, as well as side effects of solar energy, such as wind power and biomass energy from photosynthetic plants. The energy from the Sun will keep our water at the liquid state, and the Moon’s gravitational pull will continue to provide tidal energy. But Earth’s geothermal energy will slowly run down and won’t be replenished. But in terms of the universe, and the very long-term, very large-scale picture, the entropy of the universe is increasing, and so the availability of energy to do work is constantly decreasing. Eventually, when all stars have died, all forms of potential energy have been utilized, and all temperatures have equalized (depending on the mass of the universe, either at a very high temperature following a universal contraction, or a very low one, just before all activity ceases) there will be no possibility of doing work. Either way, the universe is destined for thermodynamic equilibrium—maximum entropy. This is often called the heat death of the universe, and will mean the end of all activity. However, whether the universe contracts and heats up, or continues to expand and cools down, the end is not near. Calculations of black holes suggest that entropy can easily continue for at least 1010010100 years. 1010010100"
Page 168,"Entropy is related not only to the unavailability of energy to do work—it is also a measure of disorder. This notion was initially postulated by Ludwig Boltzmann in the 1800s. For example, melting a block of ice means taking a highly structured and orderly system of water molecules and converting it into a disorderly liquid in which molecules have no fixed positions. (See Figure 15.35.) There is a large increase in entropy in the process, as seen in the following example. Example 15.8 Find the increase in entropy of 1.00 kg of ice originally at 0º C0º C that is melted to form water at 0º C0º C. 0º C0º C 0º C0º C As before, the change in entropy can be calculated from the definition of ΔSΔS once we find the energy QQ needed to melt the ice. ΔSΔS QQ The change in entropy is defined as: 15.61 Here QQ is the heat transfer necessary to melt 1.00 kg of ice and is given by QQ 15.62 where mm is the mass and LfLf is the latent heat of fusion. Lf=334 kJ/kgLf=334 kJ/kg for water, so that mm LfLf Lf=334 kJ/kgLf=334 kJ/kg 15.63 Now the change in entropy is positive, since heat transfer occurs into the ice to cause the phase change; thus, 15.64 TT is the melting temperature of ice. That is, T=0ºC=273 KT=0ºC=273 K. So the change in entropy is TT T=0ºC=273 KT=0ºC=273 K 15.65 This is a significant increase in entropy accompanying an increase in disorder. Figure 15.35 When ice melts, it becomes more disordered and less structured. The systematic arrangement of molecules in a crystal structure is replaced by a more random and less orderly movement of molecules without fixed locations or orientations. Its entropy increases because heat transfer occurs into it. Entropy is a measure of disorder. In another easily imagined example, suppose we mix equal masses of water originally at two different temperatures, say 20.0º C20.0º C and 40.0º C40.0º C. The result is water at an intermediate temperature of 30.0º C30.0º C. Three outcomes have resulted: entropy has increased, some energy has become unavailable to do work, and the system has become less orderly. Let us think about each of these results. 20.0º C20.0º C 40.0º C40.0º C 30.0º C30.0º C First, entropy has increased for the same reason that it did in the example above. Mixing the two bodies of water has the same effect as heat transfer from the hot one and the same heat transfer into the cold one. The mixing decreases the entropy of the hot water but increases the entropy of the cold water by a greater amount, producing an overall increase in entropy. Second, once the two masses of water are mixed, there is only one temperature—you cannot run a heat engine with them. The energy that could have been used to run a heat engine is now unavailable to do work. Third, the mixture is less orderly, or to use another term, less structured. Rather than having two masses at different temperatures and with different distributions of molecular speeds, we now have a single mass with a uniform temperature. These three results—entropy, unavailability of energy, and disorder—are not only related but are in fact essentially equivalent."
Page 168,"Some people misunderstand the second law of thermodynamics, stated in terms of entropy, to say that the process of the evolution of life violates this law. Over time, complex organisms evolved from much simpler ancestors, representing a large decrease in entropy of the Earth’s biosphere. It is a fact that living organisms have evolved to be highly structured, and much lower in entropy than the substances from which they grow. But it is always possible for the entropy of one part of the universe to decrease, provided the total change in entropy of the universe increases. In equation form, we can write this as 15.66 Thus ΔSsystΔSsyst can be negative as long as ΔSenvirΔSenvir is positive and greater in magnitude. ΔSsystΔSsyst ΔSenvirΔSenvir How is it possible for a system to decrease its entropy? Energy transfer is necessary. If I pick up marbles that are scattered about the room and put them into a cup, my work has decreased the entropy of that system. If I gather iron ore from the ground and convert it into steel and build a bridge, my work has decreased the entropy of that system. Energy coming from the Sun can decrease the entropy of local systems on Earth—that is, ΔSsystΔSsyst is negative. But the overall entropy of the rest of the universe increases by a greater amount—that is, ΔSenvirΔSenvir is positive and greater in magnitude. Thus, ΔStot=ΔSsyst+ΔSenvir>0ΔStot=ΔSsyst+ΔSenvir>0, and the second law of thermodynamics is not violated. ΔSsystΔSsyst ΔSenvirΔSenvir ΔStot=ΔSsyst+ΔSenvir>0ΔStot=ΔSsyst+ΔSenvir>0 Every time a plant stores some solar energy in the form of chemical potential energy, or an updraft of warm air lifts a soaring bird, the Earth can be viewed as a heat engine operating between a hot reservoir supplied by the Sun and a cold reservoir supplied by dark outer space—a heat engine of high complexity, causing local decreases in entropy as it uses part of the heat transfer from the Sun into deep space. There is a large total increase in entropy resulting from this massive heat transfer. A small part of this heat transfer is stored in structured systems on Earth, producing much smaller local decreases in entropy. (See Figure 15.36.) Figure 15.36 Earth’s entropy may decrease in the process of intercepting a small part of the heat transfer from the Sun into deep space. Entropy for the entire process increases greatly while Earth becomes more structured with living systems and stored energy in various forms."

Page 169,"What are the possible outcomes of tossing 5 coins? Each coin can land either heads or tails. On the large scale, we are concerned only with the total heads and tails and not with the order in which heads and tails appear. The following possibilities exist: 15.67 These are what we call macrostates. A macrostate is an overall property of a system. It does not specify the details of the system, such as the order in which heads and tails occur or which coins are heads or tails. macrostate Using this nomenclature, a system of 5 coins has the 6 possible macrostates just listed. Some macrostates are more likely to occur than others. For instance, there is only one way to get 5 heads, but there are several ways to get 3 heads and 2 tails, making the latter macrostate more probable. Table 15.3 lists of all the ways in which 5 coins can be tossed, taking into account the order in which heads and tails occur. Each sequence is called a microstate—a detailed description of every element of a system. microstate Table 15.3 5-Coin Toss The macrostate of 3 heads and 2 tails can be achieved in 10 ways and is thus 10 times more probable than the one having 5 heads. Not surprisingly, it is equally probable to have the reverse, 2 heads and 3 tails. Similarly, it is equally probable to get 5 tails as it is to get 5 heads. Note that all of these conclusions are based on the crucial assumption that each microstate is equally probable. With coin tosses, this requires that the coins not be asymmetric in a way that favors one side over the other, as with loaded dice. With any system, the assumption that all microstates are equally probable must be valid, or the analysis will be erroneous. The two most orderly possibilities are 5 heads or 5 tails. (They are more structured than the others.) They are also the least likely, only 2 out of 32 possibilities. The most disorderly possibilities are 3 heads and 2 tails and its reverse. (They are the least structured.) The most disorderly possibilities are also the most likely, with 20 out of 32 possibilities for the 3 heads and 2 tails and its reverse. If we start with an orderly array like 5 heads and toss the coins, it is very likely that we will get a less orderly array as a result, since 30 out of the 32 possibilities are less orderly. So even if you start with an orderly state, there is a strong tendency to go from order to disorder, from low entropy to high entropy. The reverse can happen, but it is unlikely. Table 15.4 100-Coin Toss This result becomes dramatic for larger systems. Consider what happens if you have 100 coins instead of just 5. The most orderly arrangements (most structured) are 100 heads or 100 tails. The least orderly (least structured) is that of 50 heads and 50 tails. There is only 1 way (1 microstate) to get the most orderly arrangement of 100 heads. There are 100 ways (100 microstates) to get the next most orderly arrangement of 99 heads and 1 tail (also 100 to get its reverse). And there are 1.0×10291.0×1029 ways to get 50 heads and 50 tails, the least orderly arrangement. Table 15.4 is an abbreviated list of the various macrostates and the number of microstates for each macrostate. The total number of microstates—the total number of different ways 100 coins can be tossed—is an impressively large 1.27×10301.27×1030. Now, if we start with an orderly macrostate like 100 heads and toss the coins, there is a virtual certainty that we will get a less orderly macrostate. If we keep tossing the coins, it is possible, but exceedingly unlikely, that we will ever get back to the most orderly macrostate. If you tossed the coins once each second, you could expect to get either 100 heads or 100 tails once in 2×10222×1022 years! This period is 1 trillion (10121012) times longer than the age of the universe, and so the chances are essentially zero. In contrast, there is an 8% chance of getting 50 heads, a 73% chance of getting from 45 to 55 heads, and a 96% chance of getting from 40 to 60 heads. Disorder is highly likely. 1.0×10291.0×1029 1.27×10301.27×1030 2×10222×1022 10121012"
Page 169,"The fantastic growth in the odds favoring disorder that we see in going from 5 to 100 coins continues as the number of entities in the system increases. Let us now imagine applying this approach to perhaps a small sample of gas. Because counting microstates and macrostates involves statistics, this is called statistical analysis. The macrostates of a gas correspond to its macroscopic properties, such as volume, temperature, and pressure; and its microstates correspond to the detailed description of the positions and velocities of its atoms. Even a small amount of gas has a huge number of atoms: 1.0 cm31.0 cm3 of an ideal gas at 1.0 atm and 0º C0º C has 2.7×10192.7×1019 atoms. So each macrostate has an immense number of microstates. In plain language, this means that there are an immense number of ways in which the atoms in a gas can be arranged, while still having the same pressure, temperature, and so on. statistical analysis 1.0 cm31.0 cm3 0º C0º C 2.7×10192.7×1019 The most likely conditions (or macrostates) for a gas are those we see all the time—a random distribution of atoms in space with a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution of speeds in random directions, as predicted by kinetic theory. This is the most disorderly and least structured condition we can imagine. In contrast, one type of very orderly and structured macrostate has all of the atoms in one corner of a container with identical velocities. There are very few ways to accomplish this (very few microstates corresponding to it), and so it is exceedingly unlikely ever to occur. (See Figure 15.38(b).) Indeed, it is so unlikely that we have a law saying that it is impossible, which has never been observed to be violated—the second law of thermodynamics. Figure 15.38 (a) The ordinary state of gas in a container is a disorderly, random distribution of atoms or molecules with a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution of speeds. It is so unlikely that these atoms or molecules would ever end up in one corner of the container that it might as well be impossible. (b) With energy transfer, the gas can be forced into one corner and its entropy greatly reduced. But left alone, it will spontaneously increase its entropy and return to the normal conditions, because they are immensely more likely. The disordered condition is one of high entropy, and the ordered one has low entropy. With a transfer of energy from another system, we could force all of the atoms into one corner and have a local decrease in entropy, but at the cost of an overall increase in entropy of the universe. If the atoms start out in one corner, they will quickly disperse and become uniformly distributed and will never return to the orderly original state (Figure 15.38(b)). Entropy will increase. With such a large sample of atoms, it is possible—but unimaginably unlikely—for entropy to decrease. Disorder is vastly more likely than order. The arguments that disorder and high entropy are the most probable states are quite convincing. The great Austrian physicist Ludwig Boltzmann (1844–1906)—who, along with Maxwell, made so many contributions to kinetic theory—proved that the entropy of a system in a given state (a macrostate) can be written as 15.68 where k=1.38×10−23J/Kk=1.38×10−23J/K is Boltzmann’s constant, and lnWlnW is the natural logarithm of the number of microstates WW corresponding to the given macrostate. WW is proportional to the probability that the macrostate will occur. Thus entropy is directly related to the probability of a state—the more likely the state, the greater its entropy. Boltzmann proved that this expression for ss is equivalent to the definition ΔS=Q/TΔS=Q/T, which we have used extensively. k=1.38×10−23J/Kk=1.38×10−23J/K lnWlnW WW WW ss ΔS=Q/TΔS=Q/T Thus the second law of thermodynamics is explained on a very basic level: entropy either remains the same or increases in every process. This phenomenon is due to the extraordinarily small probability of a decrease, based on the extraordinarily larger number of microstates in systems with greater entropy. Entropy can decrease, but for any macroscopic system, this outcome is so unlikely that it will never be observed."
Page 169,"Suppose you toss 100 coins starting with 60 heads and 40 tails, and you get the most likely result, 50 heads and 50 tails. What is the change in entropy? Noting that the number of microstates is labeled WW in Table 15.4 for the 100-coin toss, we can use ΔS=Sf−Si=k lnWf-klnWiΔS=Sf−Si=k lnWf-klnWi to calculate the change in entropy. WW ΔS=Sf−Si=k lnWf-klnWiΔS=Sf−Si=k lnWf-klnWi The change in entropy is 15.69 where the subscript i stands for the initial 60 heads and 40 tails state, and the subscript f for the final 50 heads and 50 tails state. Substituting the values for WW from Table 15.4 gives WW 15.70 This increase in entropy means we have moved to a less orderly situation. It is not impossible for further tosses to produce the initial state of 60 heads and 40 tails, but it is less likely. There is about a 1 in 90 chance for that decrease in entropy (–2.7×10–23 J/K–2.7×10–23 J/K) to occur. If we calculate the decrease in entropy to move to the most orderly state, we get ΔS=–92×10–23 J/KΔS=–92×10–23 J/K. There is about a 1 in 10301 in 1030 chance of this change occurring. So while very small decreases in entropy are unlikely, slightly greater decreases are impossibly unlikely. These probabilities imply, again, that for a macroscopic system, a decrease in entropy is impossible. For example, for heat transfer to occur spontaneously from 1.00 kg of 0ºC0ºC ice to its 0ºC0ºC environment, there would be a decrease in entropy of 1.22×103 J/K1.22×103 J/K. Given that a ΔS of 10–21 J/KΔS of 10–21 J/K corresponds to about a 1 in 10301 in 1030 chance, a decrease of this size (103 J/K103 J/K) is an utter impossibility. Even for a milligram of melted ice to spontaneously refreeze is impossible. –2.7×10–23 J/K–2.7×10–23 J/K ΔS=–92×10–23 J/KΔS=–92×10–23 J/K 1 in 10301 in 1030 0ºC0ºC 0ºC0ºC 1.22×103 J/K1.22×103 J/K ΔS of 10–21 J/KΔS of 10–21 J/K 1 in 10301 in 1030 103 J/K103 J/K"

A great deal of effort, time, and money has been spent in the quest for the so-called perpetual-motion machine, which is defined as a hypothetical machine that operates or produces useful work indefinitely and/or a hypothetical machine that produces more work or energy than it consumes. Explain, in terms of heat engines and the first law of thermodynamics, why or why not such a machine is likely to be constructed. 9 . One method of converting heat transfer into doing work is for heat transfer into a gas to take place, which expands, doing work on a piston, as shown in the figure below.

Page 175,"Figure 16.5 The mass of a car increases due to the introduction of a passenger. This affects the displacement of the car on its suspension system. (credit: exfordy on Flickr) What is the force constant for the suspension system of a car that settles 1.20 cm when an 80.0-kg person gets in? Consider the car to be in its equilibrium position x=0x=0 before the person gets in. The car then settles down 1.20 cm, which means it is displaced to a position x=−1.20×10−2mx=−1.20×10−2m. At that point, the springs supply a restoring force FF equal to the person’s weight w=mg=80.0 kg9.80m/s2=784Nw=mg=80.0 kg9.80m/s2=784N. We take this force to be FF in Hooke’s law. Knowing FF and xx, we can then solve the force constant kk. x=0x=0 x=−1.20×10−2mx=−1.20×10−2m FF w=mg=80.0 kg9.80m/s2=784Nw=mg=80.0 kg9.80m/s2=784N FF FF xx kk 16.2 Substitute known values and solve kk: kk 16.3 Note that FF and xx have opposite signs because they are in opposite directions—the restoring force is up, and the displacement is down. Also, note that the car would oscillate up and down when the person got in if it were not for damping (due to frictional forces) provided by shock absorbers. Bouncing cars are a sure sign of bad shock absorbers. FF xx"
Page 175,"In order to produce a deformation, work must be done. That is, a force must be exerted through a distance, whether you pluck a guitar string or compress a car spring. If the only result is deformation, and no work goes into thermal, sound, or kinetic energy, then all the work is initially stored in the deformed object as some form of potential energy. The potential energy stored in a spring is PEel=12kx2PEel=12kx2. Here, we generalize the idea to elastic potential energy for a deformation of any system that can be described by Hooke’s law. Hence, PEel=12kx2PEel=12kx2 16.4 where PEelPEel is the elastic potential energy stored in any deformed system that obeys Hooke’s law and has a displacement xx from equilibrium and a force constant kk. PEelPEel elastic potential energy xx kk It is possible to find the work done in deforming a system in order to find the energy stored. This work is performed by an applied force FappFapp. The applied force is exactly opposite to the restoring force (action-reaction), and so Fapp=kxFapp=kx. Figure 16.6 shows a graph of the applied force versus deformation xx for a system that can be described by Hooke’s law. Work done on the system is force multiplied by distance, which equals the area under the curve or (1/2)kx2(1/2)kx2(Method A in the figure). Another way to determine the work is to note that the force increases linearly from 0 to kxkx, so that the average force is (1/2)kx(1/2)kx, the distance moved is xx, and thus W=Fappd=[(1/2)kx](x)=(1/2)kx2W=Fappd=[(1/2)kx](x)=(1/2)kx2 (Method B in the figure). FappFapp Fapp=kxFapp=kx xx (1/2)kx2(1/2)kx2 kxkx (1/2)kx(1/2)kx xx W=Fappd=[(1/2)kx](x)=(1/2)kx2W=Fappd=[(1/2)kx](x)=(1/2)kx2 Figure 16.6 A graph of applied force versus distance for the deformation of a system that can be described by Hooke’s law is displayed. The work done on the system equals the area under the graph or the area of the triangle, which is half its base multiplied by its height, or W=(1/2)kx2W=(1/2)kx2. Example 16.2 We can use a toy gun’s spring mechanism to ask and answer two simple questions: (a) How much energy is stored in the spring of a toy gun that has a force constant of 50.0 N/m and is compressed 0.150 m? (b) If you neglect friction and the mass of the spring, at what speed will a 2.00-g projectile be ejected from the gun? Figure 16.7 (a) In this image of the gun, the spring is uncompressed before being cocked. (b) The spring has been compressed a distance xx, and the projectile is in place. (c) When released, the spring converts elastic potential energy PEelPEel into kinetic energy. (a): The energy stored in the spring can be found directly from elastic potential energy equation, because kk and xx are given. kk xx Entering the given values for kk and xx yields kk xx 16.5 Because there is no friction, the potential energy is converted entirely into kinetic energy. The expression for kinetic energy can be solved for the projectile’s speed. 16.6 16.7 (a) and (b): This projectile speed is impressive for a toy gun (more than 80 km/h). The numbers in this problem seem reasonable. The force needed to compress the spring is small enough for an adult to manage, and the energy imparted to the dart is small enough to limit the damage it might do, especially because the darts in many of these guns are made of soft material with a rubber tip. Yet, the speed of the dart is great enough for it to travel an acceptable distance. Check Your Understanding Envision holding the end of a ruler with one hand and deforming it with the other.

Page 177,"If a time-exposure photograph of the bouncing car were taken as it drove by, the headlight would make a wavelike streak, as shown in Figure 16.10. Similarly, Figure 16.11 shows an object bouncing on a spring as it leaves a wavelike ""trace"" of its position on a moving strip of paper. Both waves are sine functions. All simple harmonic motion is intimately related to sine and cosine waves. Figure 16.10 The bouncing car makes a wavelike motion. If the restoring force in the suspension system can be described only by Hooke’s law, then the wave is a sine function. (The wave is the trace produced by the headlight as the car moves to the right.) Figure 16.11 The vertical position of an object bouncing on a spring is recorded on a strip of moving paper, leaving a sine wave. The displacement as a function of time t in any simple harmonic motion—that is, one in which the net restoring force can be described by Hooke’s law, is given by 16.20 where XX is amplitude. At t=0t=0, the initial position is x0=Xx0=X, and the displacement oscillates back and forth with a period TT. (When t=Tt=T, we get x=Xx=X again because cos2π=1cos2π=1.). Furthermore, from this expression for xx, the velocity vv as a function of time is given by: XX t=0t=0 x0=Xx0=X TT t=Tt=T x=Xx=X cos2π=1cos2π=1 xx vv 16.21 where vmax=2πX/T=Xk/mvmax=2πX/T=Xk/m. The object has zero velocity at maximum displacement—for example, v=0v=0 when t=0t=0, and at that time x=Xx=X. The minus sign in the first equation for v(t)v(t) gives the correct direction for the velocity. Just after the start of the motion, for instance, the velocity is negative because the system is moving back toward the equilibrium point. Finally, we can get an expression for acceleration using Newton’s second law. [Then we have x(t), v(t), t,x(t), v(t), t, and a(t)a(t), the quantities needed for kinematics and a description of simple harmonic motion.] According to Newton’s second law, the acceleration is a=F/m=kx/ma=F/m=kx/m. So, a(t)a(t) is also a cosine function: vmax=2πX/T=Xk/mvmax=2πX/T=Xk/m v=0v=0 t=0t=0 x=Xx=X v(t)v(t) x(t), v(t), t,x(t), v(t), t, a(t)a(t) a=F/m=kx/ma=F/m=kx/m a(t)a(t) 16.22 Hence, a(t)a(t) is directly proportional to and in the opposite direction to x(t)x(t). a(t)a(t) x(t)x(t) Figure 16.12 shows the simple harmonic motion of an object on a spring and presents graphs of  x(t), v(t), x(t), v(t), and a(t)a(t) versus time. x(t), v(t), x(t), v(t), a(t)a(t) Figure 16.12 Graphs of x(t),v(t),x(t),v(t), and a(t)a(t) versus tt for the motion of an object on a spring. The net force on the object can be described by Hooke’s law, and so the object undergoes simple harmonic motion. Note that the initial position has the vertical displacement at its maximum value XX; vv is initially zero and then negative as the object moves down; and the initial acceleration is negative, back toward the equilibrium position and becomes zero at that point. The most important point here is that these equations are mathematically straightforward and are valid for all simple harmonic motion. They are very useful in visualizing waves associated with simple harmonic motion, including visualizing how waves add with one another. Check Your Understanding Suppose you pluck a banjo string.

The force constant of the spring is k=50.0 N/m k=50.0 N/m . μkμk v=0v=0 k=50.0 N/m k=50.0 N/m Figure 16.22 The transformation of energy in simple harmonic motion is illustrated for an object attached to a spring on a frictionless surface. This problem requires you to integrate your knowledge of various concepts regarding waves, oscillations, and damping. To solve an integrated concept problem, you must first identify the physical principles involved. Part (a) is about the frictional force. This is a topic involving the application of Newton’s Laws. Part (b) requires an understanding of work and conservation of energy, as well as some understanding of horizontal oscillatory systems. Now that we have identified the principles we must apply in order to solve the problems, we need to identify the knowns and unknowns for each part of the question, as well as the quantity that is constant in Part (a) and Part (b) of the question. 16.58 The force here is small because the system and the coefficients are small. Identify the known: 16.59 16.60 16.61 16.62 16.63 16.64 16.65 This is the total distance traveled back and forth across x=0x=0, which is the undamped equilibrium position.

 because the amplitude of the oscillations is decreasing with time. At the end of the motion, this system will not return to x=0x=0 for this type of damping force, because static friction will exceed the restoring force. This system is underdamped. In contrast, an overdamped system with a simple constant damping force would not cross the equilibrium position x=0x=0 a single time. For example, if this system had a damping force 20 times greater, it would only move 0.0484 m toward the equilibrium position from its original 0.100-m position. x=0x=0 d

9 x=0x=0 x=0x=0 This worked example illustrates how to apply problem-solving strategies to situations that integrate the different concepts you have learned. The first step is to identify the physical principles involved in the problem. The second step is to solve for the unknowns using familiar problem-solving strategies. These are found throughout the text, and many worked examples show how to use them for single topics. In this integrated concepts example, you can see how to apply them across several topics. You will find these techniques useful in applications of physics outside a physics course, such as in your profession, in other science disciplines, and in everyday life."

Page 183,"Many people think that water waves push water from one direction to another. In fact, the particles of water tend to stay in one location, save for moving up and down due to the energy in the wave. The energy moves forward through the water, but the water stays in one place. If you feel yourself pushed in an ocean, what you feel is the energy of the wave, not a rush of water."
Page 183,"A simple wave consists of a periodic disturbance that propagates from one place to another. The wave in Figure 16.29 propagates in the horizontal direction while the surface is disturbed in the vertical direction. Such a wave is called a transverse wave or shear wave; in such a wave, the disturbance is perpendicular to the direction of propagation. In contrast, in a longitudinal wave or compressional wave, the disturbance is parallel to the direction of propagation. Figure 16.30 shows an example of a longitudinal wave. The size of the disturbance is its amplitude X and is completely independent of the speed of propagation vwvw. transverse wave longitudinal wave vwvw Figure 16.29 In this example of a transverse wave, the wave propagates horizontally, and the disturbance in the cord is in the vertical direction. Figure 16.30 In this example of a longitudinal wave, the wave propagates horizontally, and the disturbance in the cord is also in the horizontal direction. Waves may be transverse, longitudinal, or a combination of the two. (Water waves are actually a combination of transverse and longitudinal. The simplified water wave illustrated in Figure 16.28
shows no longitudinal motion of the bird.) The waves on the strings of musical instruments are transverse—so are electromagnetic waves, such as visible light. Sound waves in air and water are longitudinal. Their disturbances are periodic variations in pressure that are transmitted in fluids. Fluids do not have appreciable shear strength, and thus the sound waves in them must be longitudinal or compressional. Sound in solids can be both longitudinal and transverse. Figure 16.31 The wave on a guitar string is transverse. The sound wave rattles a sheet of paper in a direction that shows the sound wave is longitudinal. Earthquake waves under Earth’s surface also have both longitudinal and transverse components (called compressional or P-waves and shear or S-waves, respectively). These components have important individual characteristics—they propagate at different speeds, for example. Earthquakes also have surface waves that are similar to surface waves on water."
Page 183,"Solution In the different types of waves, energy can propagate in a different direction relative to the motion of the wave. This is important to understand how different types of waves affect the materials around them."

Page 184,"Sometimes waves do not seem to move; rather, they just vibrate in place. Unmoving waves can be seen on the surface of a glass of milk in a refrigerator, for example. Vibrations from the refrigerator motor create waves on the milk that oscillate up and down but do not seem to move across the surface. These waves are formed by the superposition of two or more moving waves, such as illustrated in Figure 16.36 for two identical waves moving in opposite directions. The waves move through each other with their disturbances adding as they go by. If the two waves have the same amplitude and wavelength, then they alternate between constructive and destructive interference. The resultant looks like a wave standing in place and, thus, is called a standing wave. Waves on the glass of milk are one example of standing waves. There are other standing waves, such as on guitar strings and in organ pipes. With the glass of milk, the two waves that produce standing waves may come from reflections from the side of the glass. standing wave A closer look at earthquakes provides evidence for conditions appropriate for resonance, standing waves, and constructive and destructive interference. A building may be vibrated for several seconds with a driving frequency matching that of the natural frequency of vibration of the building—producing a resonance resulting in one building collapsing while neighboring buildings do not. Often buildings of a certain height are devastated while other taller buildings remain intact. The building height matches the condition for setting up a standing wave for that particular height. As the earthquake waves travel along the surface of Earth and reflect off denser rocks, constructive interference occurs at certain points. Often areas closer to the epicenter are not damaged while areas farther away are damaged. Figure 16.36 Standing wave created by the superposition of two identical waves moving in opposite directions. The oscillations are at fixed locations in space and result from alternately constructive and destructive interference. Standing waves are also found on the strings of musical instruments and are due to reflections of waves from the ends of the string. Figure 16.37 and Figure 16.38 show three standing waves that can be created on a string that is fixed at both ends. Nodes are the points where the string does not move; more generally, nodes are where the wave disturbance is zero in a standing wave. The fixed ends of strings must be nodes, too, because the string cannot move there. The word antinode is used to denote the location of maximum amplitude in standing waves. Standing waves on strings have a frequency that is related to the propagation speed vwvw of the disturbance on the string. The wavelength λλ is determined by the distance between the points where the string is fixed in place. Nodes antinode vwvw λλ The lowest frequency, called the fundamental frequency, is thus for the longest wavelength, which is seen to be λ1=2Lλ1=2L. Therefore, the fundamental frequency is f1=vw/λ1=vw/2Lf1=vw/λ1=vw/2L. In this case, the overtones or harmonics are multiples of the fundamental frequency. As seen in Figure 16.38, the first harmonic can easily be calculated since λ2=Lλ2=L. Thus, f2=vw/λ2=vw/2L=2f1f2=vw/λ2=vw/2L=2f1. Similarly, f3=3f1f3=3f1, and so on. All of these frequencies can be changed by adjusting the tension in the string. The greater the tension, the greater vwvw is and the higher the frequencies. This observation is familiar to anyone who has ever observed a string instrument being tuned. We will see in later chapters that standing waves are crucial to many resonance phenomena, such as in sounding boxes on string instruments. fundamental frequency λ1=2Lλ1=2L f1=vw/λ1=vw/2Lf1=vw/λ1=vw/2L overtones λ2=Lλ2=L f2=vw/λ2=vw/2L=2f1f2=vw/λ2=vw/2L=2f1 f3=3f1f3=3f1 vwvw Figure 16.37 The figure shows a string oscillating at its fundamental frequency. Figure 16.38 First and second overtones are shown."
Page 184,"Striking two adjacent keys on a piano produces a warbling combination usually considered to be unpleasant. The superposition of two waves of similar but not identical frequencies is the culprit. Another example is often noticeable in jet aircraft, particularly the two-engine variety, while taxiing. The combined sound of the engines goes up and down in loudness. This varying loudness happens because the sound waves have similar but not identical frequencies. The discordant warbling of the piano and the fluctuating loudness of the jet engine noise are both due to alternately constructive and destructive interference as the two waves go in and out of phase. Figure 16.39 illustrates this graphically. Figure 16.39 Beats are produced by the superposition of two waves of slightly different frequencies but identical amplitudes. The waves alternate in time between constructive interference and destructive interference, giving the resulting wave a time-varying amplitude. The wave resulting from the superposition of two similar-frequency waves has a frequency that is the average of the two. This wave fluctuates in amplitude, or beats, with a frequency called the beat frequency. We can determine the beat frequency by adding two waves together mathematically. Note that a wave can be represented at one point in space as beat frequency 16.69 where f=1/Tf=1/T is the frequency of the wave. Adding two waves that have different frequencies but identical amplitudes produces a resultant f=1/Tf=1/T 16.70 More specifically, 16.71 Using a trigonometric identity, it can be shown that 16.72 where 16.73 is the beat frequency, and favefave is the average of f1f1 and f2f2. These results mean that the resultant wave has twice the amplitude and the average frequency of the two superimposed waves, but it also fluctuates in overall amplitude at the beat frequency fBfB. The first cosine term in the expression effectively causes the amplitude to go up and down. The second cosine term is the wave with frequency favefave. This result is valid for all types of waves. However, if it is a sound wave, providing the two frequencies are similar, then what we hear is an average frequency that gets louder and softer (or warbles) at the beat frequency. favefave f1f1 f2f2 fBfB favefave Making Career Connections Piano tuners use beats routinely in their work. When comparing a note with a tuning fork, they listen for beats and adjust the string until the beats go away (to zero frequency). For example, if the tuning fork has a 256Hz256Hz frequency and two beats per second are heard, then the other frequency is either 254254 or 258Hz258Hz. Most keys hit multiple strings, and these strings are actually adjusted until they have nearly the same frequency and give a slow beat for richness. Twelve-string guitars and mandolins are also tuned using beats. 256Hz256Hz 254254 258Hz258Hz While beats may sometimes be annoying in audible sounds, we will find that beats have many applications. Observing beats is a very useful way to compare similar frequencies. There are applications of beats as apparently disparate as in ultrasonic imaging and radar speed traps."

Page 194,"The Doppler effect occurs not only for sound but for any wave when there is relative motion between the observer and the source. There are Doppler shifts in the frequency of sound, light, and water waves, for example. Doppler shifts can be used to determine velocity, such as when ultrasound is reflected from blood in a medical diagnostic. The recession of galaxies is determined by the shift in the frequencies of light received from them and has implied much about the origins of the universe. Modern physics has been profoundly affected by observations of Doppler shifts."
Page 194,"What happens to the sound produced by a moving source, such as a jet airplane, that approaches or even exceeds the speed of sound? The answer to this question applies not only to sound but to all other waves as well. Suppose a jet airplane is coming nearly straight at you, emitting a sound of frequency fsfs. The greater the plane’s speed vsvs, the greater the Doppler shift and the greater the value observed for fobsfobs. Now, as vsvs approaches the speed of sound, fobsfobs approaches infinity, because the denominator in
fobs=fsvwvw±vsfobs=fsvwvw±vs approaches zero. At the speed of sound, this result means that in front of the source, each successive wave is superimposed on the previous one because the source moves forward at the speed of sound. The observer gets them all at the same instant, and so the frequency is infinite. (Before airplanes exceeded the speed of sound, some people argued it would be impossible because such constructive superposition would produce pressures great enough to destroy the airplane.) If the source exceeds the speed of sound, no sound is received by the observer until the source has passed, so that the sounds from the approaching source are mixed with those from it when receding. This mixing appears messy, but something interesting happens—a sonic boom is created. (See Figure 17.16.) fsfs vsvs fobsfobs vsvs fobsfobs fobs=fsvwvw±vsfobs=fsvwvw±vs Figure 17.16 Sound waves from a source that moves faster than the speed of sound spread spherically from the point where they are emitted, but the source moves ahead of each. Constructive interference along the lines shown (actually a cone in three dimensions) creates a shock wave called a sonic boom. The faster the speed of the source, the smaller the angle θθ. There is constructive interference along the lines shown (a cone in three dimensions) from similar sound waves arriving there simultaneously. This superposition forms a disturbance called a sonic boom, a constructive interference of sound created by an object moving faster than sound. Inside the cone, the interference is mostly destructive, and so the sound intensity there is much less than on the shock wave. An aircraft creates two sonic booms, one from its nose and one from its tail. (See Figure 17.17.) During television coverage of space shuttle landings, two distinct booms could often be heard. These were separated by exactly the time it would take the shuttle to pass by a point. Observers on the ground often do not see the aircraft creating the sonic boom, because it has passed by before the shock wave reaches them, as seen in Figure 17.17. If the aircraft flies close by at low altitude, pressures in the sonic boom can be destructive and break windows as well as rattle nerves. Because of how destructive sonic booms can be, supersonic flights are banned over populated areas of the United States. sonic boom Figure 17.17 Two sonic booms, created by the nose and tail of an aircraft, are observed on the ground after the plane has passed by. Sonic booms are one example of a broader phenomenon called bow wakes. A bow wake, such as the one in Figure 17.18, is created when the wave source moves faster than the wave propagation speed. Water waves spread out in circles from the point where created, and the bow wake is the familiar V-shaped wake trailing the source. A more exotic bow wake is created when a subatomic particle travels through a medium faster than the speed of light travels in that medium. (In a vacuum, the maximum speed of light will be c=3.00×108

m/s; in the medium of water, the speed of light is closer to 0.75c0.75c. If the particle creates light in its passage, that light spreads on a cone with an angle indicative of the speed of the particle, as illustrated in Figure 17.19. Such a bow wake is called Cerenkov radiation and is commonly observed in particle physics. bow wake c=3.00×108

(credit: U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission) Doppler shifts and sonic booms are interesting sound phenomena that occur in all types of waves. They can be of considerable use. For example, the Doppler shift in ultrasound can be used to measure blood velocity, while police use the Doppler shift in radar (a microwave) to measure car velocities. In meteorology, the Doppler shift is used to track the motion of storm clouds; such “Doppler Radar” can give velocity and direction and rain or snow potential of imposing weather fronts. In astronomy, we can examine the light emitted from distant galaxies and determine their speed relative to ours. As galaxies move away from us, their light is shifted to a lower frequency, and so to a longer wavelength—the so-called red shift. Such information from galaxies far, far away has allowed us to estimate the age of the universe (from the Big Bang) as about 14 billion years. Check Your Understanding Why did scientist Christian Doppler observe musicians both on a moving train and also from a stationary point not on the train? Solution Doppler needed to compare the perception of sound when the observer is stationary and the sound source moves, as well as when the sound source and the observer are both in motion. Check Your Understanding Describe a situation in your life when you might rely on the Doppler shift to help you either while driving a car or walking near traffic. Solution If I am driving and I hear Doppler shift in an ambulance siren, I would be able to tell when it was getting closer and also if it has passed by. This would help me to know whether I needed to pull over and let the ambulance through."

Page 197,"The characteristics of ultrasound, such as frequency and intensity, are wave properties common to all types of waves. Ultrasound also has a wavelength that limits the fineness of detail it can detect. This characteristic is true of all waves. We can never observe details significantly smaller than the wavelength of our probe; for example, we will never see individual atoms with visible light, because the atoms are so small compared with the wavelength of light."
Page 197,"Ultrasound, like any wave, carries energy that can be absorbed by the medium carrying it, producing effects that vary with intensity. When focused to intensities of 103103 to 105105 W/m2W/m2, ultrasound can be used to shatter gallstones or pulverize cancerous tissue in surgical procedures. (See Figure 17.41.) Intensities this great can damage individual cells, variously causing their protoplasm to stream inside them, altering their permeability, or rupturing their walls through cavitation. Cavitation is the creation of vapor cavities in a fluid—the longitudinal vibrations in ultrasound alternatively compress and expand the medium, and at sufficient amplitudes the expansion separates molecules. Most cavitation damage is done when the cavities collapse, producing even greater shock pressures. 103103 105105 W/m2W/m2 Figure 17.41 The tip of this small probe oscillates at 23 kHz with such a large amplitude that it pulverizes tissue on contact. The debris is then aspirated. The speed of the tip may exceed the speed of sound in tissue, thus creating shock waves and cavitation, rather than a smooth simple harmonic oscillator–type wave. Most of the energy carried by high-intensity ultrasound in tissue is converted to thermal energy. In fact, intensities of 103103 to 104W/m2104W/m2 are commonly used for deep-heat treatments called ultrasound diathermy. Frequencies of 0.8 to 1 MHz are typical. In both athletics and physical therapy, ultrasound diathermy is most often applied to injured or overworked muscles to relieve pain and improve flexibility. Skill is needed by the therapist to avoid “bone burns” and other tissue damage caused by overheating and cavitation, sometimes made worse by reflection and focusing of the ultrasound by joint and bone tissue. 103103 104W/m2104W/m2 In some instances, you may encounter a different decibel scale, called the sound pressure level, when ultrasound travels in water or in human and other biological tissues. We shall not use the scale here, but it is notable that numbers for sound pressure levels range 60 to 70 dB higher than you would quote for ββ, the sound intensity level used in this text. Should you encounter a sound pressure level of 220 decibels, then, it is not an astronomically high intensity, but equivalent to about 155 dB—high enough to destroy tissue, but not as unreasonably high as it might seem at first. ββ"
Page 197,"When used for imaging, ultrasonic waves are emitted from a transducer, a crystal exhibiting the piezoelectric effect (the expansion and contraction of a substance when a voltage is applied across it, causing a vibration of the crystal). These high-frequency vibrations are transmitted into any tissue in contact with the transducer. Similarly, if a pressure is applied to the crystal (in the form of a wave reflected off tissue layers), a voltage is produced which can be recorded. The crystal therefore acts as both a transmitter and a receiver of sound. Ultrasound is also partially absorbed by tissue on its path, both on its journey away from the transducer and on its return journey. From the time between when the original signal is sent and when the reflections from various boundaries between media are received, (as well as a measure of the intensity loss of the signal), the nature and position of each boundary between tissues and organs may be deduced. Reflections at boundaries between two different media occur because of differences in a characteristic known as the acoustic impedance ZZ of each substance. Impedance is defined as acoustic impedance ZZ 17.38 where ρρ is the density of the medium (in kg/m3kg/m3) and vv is the speed of sound through the medium (in m/s). The units for ZZ are therefore kg/(m2·s)kg/(m2·s). ρρ kg/m3kg/m3 vv ZZ kg/(m2·s)kg/(m2·s) Table 17.5 shows the density and speed of sound through various media (including various soft tissues) and the associated acoustic impedances. Note that the acoustic impedances for soft tissue do not vary much but that there is a big difference between the acoustic impedance of soft tissue and air and also between soft tissue and bone. Table 17.5 The Ultrasound Properties of Various Media, Including Soft Tissue Found in the Body At the boundary between media of different acoustic impedances, some of the wave energy is reflected and some is transmitted. The greater the difference in acoustic impedance between the two media, the greater the reflection and the smaller the transmission. The intensity reflection coefficient aa is defined as the ratio of the intensity of the reflected wave relative to the incident (transmitted) wave. This statement can be written mathematically as intensity reflection coefficient aa 17.39 where Z1Z1 and Z2Z2 are the acoustic impedances of the two media making up the boundary. A reflection coefficient of zero (corresponding to total transmission and no reflection) occurs when the acoustic impedances of the two media are the same. An impedance “match” (no reflection) provides an efficient coupling of sound energy from one medium to another. The image formed in an ultrasound is made by tracking reflections (as shown in Figure 17.42) and mapping the intensity of the reflected sound waves in a two-dimensional plane. Z1Z1 Z2Z2 Example 17.7 (a) Using the values for density and the speed of ultrasound given in Table 17.5, show that the acoustic impedance of fat tissue is indeed 1.34×106kg/(m2·s)1.34×106kg/(m2·s). 1.34×106kg/(m2·s)1.34×106kg/(m2·s) (b) Calculate the intensity reflection coefficient of ultrasound when going from fat to muscle tissue. The acoustic impedance can be calculated using Z=ρvZ=ρv and the values for ρρ and vv found in Table 17.5. Z=ρvZ=ρv ρρ vv (1) Substitute known values from Table 17.5 into Z=ρvZ=ρv. Z=ρvZ=ρv 17.40 (2) Calculate to find the acoustic impedance of fat tissue. 17.41 This value is the same as the value given for the acoustic impedance of fat tissue. The intensity reflection coefficient for any boundary between two media is given by a=Z2−Z12Z1+Z22a=Z2−Z12Z1+Z22, and the acoustic impedance of muscle is given in Table 17.5. a=Z2−Z12Z1+Z22a=Z2−Z12Z1+Z22 Substitute known values into a=Z2−Z12Z1+Z22a=Z2−Z12Z1+Z22 to find the intensity reflection coefficient: a=Z2−Z12Z1+Z22a=Z2−Z12Z1+Z22 17.42 This result means that only 1.4% of the incident intensity is reflected, with the remaining being transmitted. The applications of ultrasound in medical diagnostics have produced untold benefits with no known risks. Diagnostic intensities are too low (about 10−2W/m210−2W/m2) to cause thermal damage. More significantly, ultrasound has been in use for several decades and detailed follow-up studies do not show evidence of ill effects, quite unlike the case for x-rays. 10−2W/m210−2W/m2 Figure 17.42 (a) An ultrasound speaker doubles as a microphone. Brief bleeps are broadcast, and echoes are recorded from various depths. (b) Graph of echo intensity versus time. The time for echoes to return is directly proportional to the distance of the reflector, yielding this information noninvasively. The most common ultrasound applications produce an image like that shown in Figure 17.43. The speaker-microphone broadcasts a directional beam, sweeping the beam across the area of interest. This is accomplished by having multiple ultrasound sources in the probe’s head, which are phased to interfere constructively in a given, adjustable direction. Echoes are measured as a function of position as well as depth. A computer constructs an image that reveals the shape and density of internal structures. Figure 17.43 (a) An ultrasonic image is produced by sweeping the ultrasonic beam across the area of interest, in this case the person's abdomen. Data are recorded and analyzed in a computer, providing a two-dimensional image (credit: COD Newsroom, Flickr). (b) Ultrasound image of 12-week-old fetus. (credit: Public Health Image Library, CDC) How much detail can ultrasound reveal? The image in Figure 17.43 is typical of low-cost systems, but that in Figure 17.44 shows the remarkable detail possible with more advanced systems, including 3D imaging. Ultrasound today is commonly used in prenatal care. Such imaging can be used to see if the fetus is developing at a normal rate, and help in the determination of serious problems early in the pregnancy. Ultrasound is also in wide use to image the chambers of the heart and the flow of blood within the beating heart, using the Doppler effect (echocardiology). Whenever a wave is used as a probe, it is very difficult to detect details smaller than its wavelength λλ. Indeed, current technology cannot do quite this well. Abdominal scans may use a 7-MHz frequency, and the speed of sound in tissue is about 1540 m/s—so the wavelength limit to detail would be λ=vwf=1540 m/s7×106Hz=0.22 mmλ=vwf=1540 m/s7×106Hz=0.22 mm. In practice, 1-mm detail is attainable, which is sufficient for many purposes. Higher-frequency ultrasound would allow greater detail, but it does not penetrate as well as lower frequencies do. The accepted rule of thumb is that you can effectively scan to a depth of about  500λ500λ into tissue. For 7 MHz, this penetration limit is 500×0.22 mm500×0.22 mm, which is 0.11 m. Higher frequencies may be employed in smaller organs, such as the eye, but are not practical for looking deep into the body. λλ λ=vwf=1540 m/s7×106Hz=0.22 mmλ=vwf=1540 m/s7×106Hz=0.22 mm 500λ500λ 500×0.22 mm500×0.22 mm Figure 17.44 A 3D ultrasound image of a fetus. (credit: Jennie Cu, Wikimedia Commons) In addition to shape information, ultrasonic scans can produce density information superior to that found in X-rays, because the intensity of a reflected sound is related to changes in density. Sound is most strongly reflected at places where density changes are greatest. Another major use of ultrasound in medical diagnostics is to detect motion and determine velocity through the Doppler shift of an echo, known as Doppler-shifted ultrasound. This technique is used to monitor fetal heartbeat, measure blood velocity, and detect occlusions in blood vessels, for example. (See Figure 17.45.) The magnitude of the Doppler shift in an echo is directly proportional to the velocity of whatever reflects the sound. Because an echo is involved, there is actually a double shift. The first occurs because the reflector (say a fetal heart) is a moving observer and receives a Doppler-shifted frequency. The reflector then acts as a moving source, producing a second Doppler shift. Doppler-shifted ultrasound Figure 17.45 This Doppler-shifted ultrasonic image of a partially occluded artery uses color to indicate velocity. The highest velocities are in red, while the lowest are blue. The blood must move faster through the constriction to carry the same flow. (credit: Arning C, Grzyska U, Wikimedia Commons) A clever technique is used to measure the Doppler shift in an echo. The frequency of the echoed sound is superimposed on the broadcast frequency, producing beats. The beat frequency is FB=∣f1−f2∣FB=∣f1−f2∣, and so it is directly proportional to the Doppler shift (f1−f2f1−f2) and hence, the reflector’s velocity. The advantage in this technique is that the Doppler shift is small (because the reflector’s velocity is small), so that great accuracy would be needed to measure the shift directly. But measuring the beat frequency is easy, and it is not affected if the broadcast frequency varies somewhat. Furthermore, the beat frequency is in the audible range and can be amplified for audio feedback to the medical observer. FB=∣f1−f2∣FB=∣f1−f2∣ f1−f2f1−f2 Uses for Doppler-Shifted Radar Doppler-shifted radar echoes are used to measure wind velocities in storms as well as aircraft and automobile speeds. The principle is the same as for Doppler-shifted ultrasound. There is evidence that bats and dolphins may also sense the velocity of an object (such as prey) reflecting their ultrasound signals by observing its Doppler shift. Example 17.8 Ultrasound that has a frequency of 2.50 MHz is sent toward blood in an artery that is moving toward the source at 20.0 cm/s, as illustrated in Figure 17.46. Use the speed of sound in human tissue as 1540 m/s. (Assume that the frequency of 2.50 MHz is accurate to seven significant figures.) Figure 17.46 Ultrasound is partly reflected by blood cells and plasma back toward the speaker-microphone. Because the cells are moving, two Doppler shifts are produced—one for blood as a moving observer, and the other for the reflected sound coming from a moving source. The magnitude of the shift is directly proportional to blood velocity. The first two questions can be answered using fobs=fsvwvw±vsfobs=fsvwvw±vs and fobs=fsvw±vobsvwfobs=fsvw±vobsvw for the Doppler shift. The last question asks for beat frequency, which is the difference between the original and returning frequencies. fobs=fsvwvw±vsfobs=fsvwvw±vs fobs=fsvw±vobsvwfobs=fsvw±vobsvw (1) Identify knowns: 17.43 (2) Enter the given values into the equation. 17.44 (3) Calculate to find the frequency: 2,500,325 Hz. (1) Identify knowns: 17.45 fobsfobs is the frequency received by the speaker-microphone. fobsfobs The minus sign is used because the motion is toward the observer. (2) Enter the given values into the equation: 17.46 (3) Calculate to find the frequency returning to the source: 2,500,649 Hz. (1) Identify knowns: 17.47 (2) Substitute known values: 17.48 (3) Calculate to find the beat frequency: 649 Hz. The Doppler shifts are quite small compared with the original frequency of 2.50 MHz. It is far easier to measure the beat frequency than it is to measure the echo frequency with an accuracy great enough to see shifts of a few hundred hertz out of a couple of megahertz. Furthermore, variations in the source frequency do not greatly affect the beat frequency, because both fsfs and fobsfobswould increase or decrease. Those changes subtract out in fB=∣fobs−fs∣.fB=∣fobs−fs∣. fsfs fobsfobs fB=∣fobs−fs∣.fB=∣fobs−fs∣. Industrial and Other Applications of Ultrasound Industrial, retail, and research applications of ultrasound are common. A few are discussed here. Ultrasonic cleaners have many uses. Jewelry, machined parts, and other objects that have odd shapes and crevices are immersed in a cleaning fluid that is agitated with ultrasound typically about 40 kHz in frequency. The intensity is great enough to cause cavitation, which is responsible for most of the cleansing action. Because cavitation-produced shock pressures are large and well transmitted in a fluid, they reach into small crevices where even a low-surface-tension cleaning fluid might not penetrate. Sonar is a familiar application of ultrasound. Sonar typically employs ultrasonic frequencies in the range from 30.0 to 100 kHz. Bats, dolphins, submarines, and even some birds use ultrasonic sonar. Echoes are analyzed to give distance and size information both for guidance and finding prey. In most sonar applications, the sound reflects quite well because the objects of interest have significantly different density than the medium in which they travel. When the Doppler shift is observed, velocity information can also be obtained. Submarine sonar can be used to obtain such information, and there is evidence that some bats also sense velocity from their echoes. Similarly, there are a range of relatively inexpensive devices that measure distance by timing ultrasonic echoes. Many cameras, for example, use such information to focus automatically. Some doors open when their ultrasonic ranging devices detect a nearby object, and certain home security lights turn on when their ultrasonic rangers observe motion. Ultrasonic “measuring tapes” also exist to measure such things as room dimensions. Sinks in public restrooms are sometimes automated with ultrasound devices to turn faucets on and off when people wash their hands. These devices reduce the spread of germs and can conserve water. Ultrasound is used for nondestructive testing in industry and by the military. Because ultrasound reflects well from any large change in density, it can reveal cracks and voids in solids, such as aircraft wings, that are too small to be seen with x-rays. For similar reasons, ultrasound is also good for measuring the thickness of coatings, particularly where there are several layers involved. Basic research in solid state physics employs ultrasound. Its attenuation is related to a number of physical characteristics, making it a useful probe. Among these characteristics are structural changes such as those found in liquid crystals, the transition of a material to a superconducting phase, as well as density and other properties. These examples of the uses of ultrasound are meant to whet the appetites of the curious, as well as to illustrate the underlying physics of ultrasound. There are many more applications, as you can easily discover for yourself. Check Your Understanding Why is it possible to use ultrasound both to observe a fetus in the womb and also to destroy cancerous tumors in the body? Solution Ultrasound can be used medically at different intensities. Lower intensities do not cause damage and are used for medical imaging. Higher intensities can pulverize and destroy targeted substances in the body, such as tumors."

Page 203,"Franklin wrote in his letters and books that he could see the effects of electric charge but did not understand what caused the phenomenon. Today we have the advantage of knowing that normal matter is made of atoms, and that atoms contain positive and negative charges, usually in equal amounts. Figure 18.5 shows a simple model of an atom with negative electrons orbiting its positive nucleus. The nucleus is positive due to the presence of positively charged protons. Nearly all charge in nature is due to electrons and protons, which are two of the three building blocks of most matter. (The third is the neutron, which is neutral, carrying no charge.) Other charge-carrying particles are observed in cosmic rays and nuclear decay, and are created in particle accelerators. All but the electron and proton survive only a short time and are quite rare by comparison. electrons protons Figure 18.5 This simplified (and not to scale) view of an atom is called the planetary model of the atom. Negative electrons orbit a much heavier positive nucleus, as the planets orbit the much heavier sun. There the similarity ends, because forces in the atom are electromagnetic, whereas those in the planetary system are gravitational. Normal macroscopic amounts of matter contain immense numbers of atoms and molecules and, hence, even greater numbers of individual negative and positive charges. The charges of electrons and protons are identical in magnitude but opposite in sign. Furthermore, all charged objects in nature are integral multiples of this basic quantity of charge, meaning that all charges are made of combinations of a basic unit of charge. Usually, charges are formed by combinations of electrons and protons. The magnitude of this basic charge is 18.1 The symbol qq is commonly used for charge and the subscript ee indicates the charge of a single electron (or proton). qq ee The SI unit of charge is the coulomb (C). The number of protons needed to make a charge of 1.00 C is 18.2 Similarly, 6.25×10186.25×1018 electrons have a combined charge of −1.00 coulomb. Just as there is a smallest bit of an element (an atom), there is a smallest bit of charge. There is no directly observed charge smaller than ∣qe∣∣qe∣ (see Things Great and Small: The Submicroscopic Origin of Charge), and all observed charges are integral multiples of ∣qe∣∣qe∣. 6.25×10186.25×1018 ∣qe∣∣qe∣ ∣qe∣∣qe∣ Things Great and Small: The Submicroscopic Origin of Charge With the exception of exotic, short-lived particles, all charge in nature is carried by electrons and protons. Electrons carry the charge we have named negative. Protons carry an equal-magnitude charge that we call positive. (See Figure 18.6.) Electron and proton charges are considered fundamental building blocks, since all other charges are integral multiples of those carried by electrons and protons. Electrons and protons are also two of the three fundamental building blocks of ordinary matter. The neutron is the third and has zero total charge. Figure 18.6 shows a person touching a Van de Graaff generator and receiving excess positive charge. The expanded view of a hair shows the existence of both types of charges but an excess of positive. The repulsion of these positive like charges causes the strands of hair to repel other strands of hair and to stand up. The further blowup shows an artist’s conception of an electron and a proton perhaps found in an atom in a strand of hair. Figure 18.6 When this person touches a Van de Graaff generator, some electrons are attracted to the generator, resulting in an excess of positive charge, causing her hair to stand on end. The charges in one hair are shown. An artist’s conception of an electron and a proton illustrate the particles carrying the negative and positive charges. We cannot really see these particles with visible light because they are so small (the electron seems to be an infinitesimal point), but we know a great deal about their measurable properties, such as the charges they carry. The electron seems to have no substructure; in contrast, when the substructure of protons is explored by scattering extremely energetic electrons from them, it appears that there are point-like particles inside the proton. These sub-particles, named quarks, have never been directly observed, but they are believed to carry fractional charges as seen in Figure 18.7. Charges on electrons and protons and all other directly observable particles are unitary, but these quark substructures carry charges of either −13−13 or +23+23. There are continuing attempts to observe fractional charge directly and to learn of the properties of quarks, which are perhaps the ultimate substructure of matter. −13−13 +23+23 Figure 18.7 Artist’s conception of fractional quark charges inside a proton. A group of three quark charges add up to the single positive charge on the proton: −13qe+23qe+23qe=+1qe−13qe+23qe+23qe=+1qe."

Page 203,"Charges in atoms and molecules can be separated—for example, by rubbing materials together. Some atoms and molecules have a greater affinity for electrons than others and will become negatively charged by close contact in rubbing, leaving the other material positively charged. (See Figure 18.8.) Positive charge can similarly be induced by rubbing. Methods other than rubbing can also separate charges. Batteries, for example, use combinations of substances that interact in such a way as to separate charges. Chemical interactions may transfer negative charge from one substance to the other, making one battery terminal negative and leaving the first one positive. Figure 18.8 When materials are rubbed together, charges can be separated, particularly if one material has a greater affinity for electrons than another. (a) Both the amber and cloth are originally neutral, with equal positive and negative charges. Only a tiny fraction of the charges are involved, and only a few of them are shown here. (b) When rubbed together, some negative charge is transferred to the amber, leaving the cloth with a net positive charge. (c) When separated, the amber and cloth now have net charges, but the absolute value of the net positive and negative charges will be equal. No charge is actually created or destroyed when charges are separated as we have been discussing. Rather, existing charges are moved about. In fact, in all situations the total amount of charge is always constant. This universally obeyed law of nature is called the law of conservation of charge. law of conservation of charge Law of Conservation of Charge Total charge is constant in any process. In more exotic situations, such as in particle accelerators, mass, ΔmΔm, can be created from energy in the amount

Δm=Ec2Δm=Ec2. Sometimes, the created mass is charged, such as when an electron is created. Whenever a charged particle is created, another having an opposite charge is always created along with it, so that the total charge created is zero. Usually, the two particles are “matter-antimatter” counterparts. For example, an antielectron would usually be created at the same time as an electron. The antielectron has a positive charge (it is called a positron), and so the total charge created is zero. (See Figure 18.9.) All particles have antimatter counterparts with opposite signs. When matter and antimatter counterparts are brought together, they completely annihilate one another. By annihilate, we mean that the mass of the two particles is converted to energy E, again obeying the relationship Δm=Ec2Δm=Ec2. Since the two particles have equal and opposite charge, the total charge is zero before and after the annihilation; thus, total charge is conserved. ΔmΔm Δm=Ec2Δm=Ec2 Δm=Ec2Δm=Ec2 Making Connections: Conservation Laws Only a limited number of physical quantities are universally conserved. Charge is one—energy, momentum, and angular momentum are others. Because they are conserved, these physical quantities are used to explain more phenomena and form more connections than other, less basic quantities. We find that conserved quantities give us great insight into the rules followed by nature and hints to the organization of nature. Discoveries of conservation laws have led to further discoveries, such as the weak nuclear force and the quark substructure of protons and other particles. Figure 18.9 (a) When enough energy is present, it can be converted into matter. Here the matter created is an electron–antielectron pair. (meme is the electron’s mass.) The total charge before and after this event is zero. (b) When matter and antimatter collide, they annihilate each other; the total charge is conserved at zero before and after the annihilation. The law of conservation of charge is absolute—it has never been observed to be violated. Charge, then, is a special physical quantity, joining a very short list of other quantities in nature that are always conserved. Other conserved quantities include energy, momentum, and angular momentum."

Page 204,"Figure 18.11 shows an electroscope being charged by touching it with a positively charged glass rod. Because the glass rod is an insulator, it must actually touch the electroscope to transfer charge to or from it. (Note that the extra positive charges reside on the surface of the glass rod as a result of rubbing it with silk before starting the experiment.) Since only electrons move in metals, we see that they are attracted to the top of the electroscope. There, some are transferred to the positive rod by touch, leaving the electroscope with a net positive charge. Electrostatic repulsion in the leaves of the charged electroscope separates them. The electrostatic force has a horizontal component that results in the leaves moving apart as well as a vertical component that is balanced by the gravitational force. Similarly, the electroscope can be negatively charged by contact with a negatively charged object. Electrostatic repulsion"
Page 204,"It is not necessary to transfer excess charge directly to an object in order to charge it. Figure 18.12 shows a method of induction wherein a charge is created in a nearby object, without direct contact. Here we see two neutral metal spheres in contact with one another but insulated from the rest of the world. A positively charged rod is brought near one of them, attracting negative charge to that side, leaving the other sphere positively charged. induction This is an example of induced polarization of neutral objects. Polarization is the separation of charges in an object that remains neutral. If the spheres are now separated (before the rod is pulled away), each sphere will have a net charge. Note that the object closest to the charged rod receives an opposite charge when charged by induction. Note also that no charge is removed from the charged rod, so that this process can be repeated without depleting the supply of excess charge. polarization Another method of charging by induction is shown in Figure 18.13. The neutral metal sphere is polarized when a charged rod is brought near it. The sphere is then grounded, meaning that a conducting wire is run from the sphere to the ground. Since the earth is large and most ground is a good conductor, it can supply or accept excess charge easily. In this case, electrons are attracted to the sphere through a wire called the ground wire, because it supplies a conducting path to the ground. The ground connection is broken before the charged rod is removed, leaving the sphere with an excess charge opposite to that of the rod. Again, an opposite charge is achieved when charging by induction and the charged rod loses none of its excess charge. Figure 18.12 Charging by induction. (a) Two uncharged or neutral metal spheres are in contact with each other but insulated from the rest of the world. (b) A positively charged glass rod is brought near the sphere on the left, attracting negative charge and leaving the other sphere positively charged. (c) The spheres are separated before the rod is removed, thus separating negative and positive charge. (d) The spheres retain net charges after the inducing rod is removed—without ever having been touched by a charged object. Figure 18.13 Charging by induction, using a ground connection. (a) A positively charged rod is brought near a neutral metal sphere, polarizing it. (b) The sphere is grounded, allowing electrons to be attracted from the earth’s ample supply. (c) The ground connection is broken. (d) The positive rod is removed, leaving the sphere with an induced negative charge. Figure 18.14 Both positive and negative objects attract a neutral object by polarizing its molecules. (a) A positive object brought near a neutral insulator polarizes its molecules. There is a slight shift in the distribution of the electrons orbiting the molecule, with unlike charges being brought nearer and like charges moved away. Since the electrostatic force decreases with distance, there is a net attraction. (b) A negative object produces the opposite polarization, but again attracts the neutral object. (c) The same effect occurs for a conductor; since the unlike charges are closer, there is a net attraction. Neutral objects can be attracted to any charged object. The pieces of straw attracted to polished amber are neutral, for example. If you run a plastic comb through your hair, the charged comb can pick up neutral pieces of paper. Figure 18.14 shows how the polarization of atoms and molecules in neutral objects results in their attraction to a charged object. When a charged rod is brought near a neutral substance, an insulator in this case, the distribution of charge in atoms and molecules is shifted slightly. Opposite charge is attracted nearer the external charged rod, while like charge is repelled. Since the electrostatic force decreases with distance, the repulsion of like charges is weaker than the attraction of unlike charges, and so there is a net attraction. Thus a positively charged glass rod attracts neutral pieces of paper, as will a negatively charged rubber rod. Some molecules, like water, are polar molecules. Polar molecules have a natural or inherent separation of charge, although they are neutral overall. Polar molecules are particularly affected by other charged objects and show greater polarization effects than molecules with naturally uniform charge distributions. Check Your Understanding Can you explain the attraction of water to the charged rod in the figure below? Figure 18.15 Solution Water molecules are polarized, giving them slightly positive and slightly negative sides. This makes water even more susceptible to a charged rod’s attraction. In addition, tap water contains dissolved ions (positive and negative charges). As the water flows downward, due to the force of gravity, the charged conductor exerts a net attraction to the opposite charges in the stream of water, pulling it closer."

Page 206,"A field is a way of conceptualizing and mapping the force that surrounds any object and acts on another object at a distance without apparent physical connection. For example, the gravitational field surrounding the earth (and all other masses) represents the gravitational force that would be experienced if another mass were placed at a given point within the field. In the same way, the Coulomb force field surrounding any charge extends throughout space. Using Coulomb’s law, F=k|q1q2|/r2F=k|q1q2|/r2, its magnitude is given by the equation

F=k|qQ|/r2F=k|qQ|/r2, for a point charge (a particle having a charge QQ) acting on a test charge qq at a distance rr (see Figure 18.18). Both the magnitude and direction of the Coulomb force field depend on QQ and the test charge qq.

Both charges are the same distance from QQ. (a) Since q1q1 is positive, the force F1F1 acting on it is repulsive. (b) The charge q2q2 is negative and greater in magnitude than q1q1, and so the force F2F2 acting on it is attractive and stronger than F1F1. The Coulomb force field is thus not unique at any point in space, because it depends on the test charges q1q1 and q2q2 as well as the charge QQ. To simplify things, we would prefer to have a field that depends only on QQ and not on the test charge qq. The electric field is defined in such a manner that it represents only the charge creating it and is unique at every point in space. Specifically, the electric field EE is defined to be the ratio of the Coulomb force to the test charge: QQ qq EE 18.11 where FF is the electrostatic force (or Coulomb force) exerted on a positive test charge
qq. It is understood that
EE is in the same direction as
FF. It is also assumed that qq is so small that it does not alter the charge distribution creating the electric field. The units of electric field are newtons per coulomb (N/C).

Since the electric field is a vector (having magnitude and direction), we add electric fields with the same vector techniques used for other types of vectors. We first must find the electric field due to each charge at the point of interest, which is the origin of the coordinate system (O) in this instance. We pretend that there is a positive test charge, qq, at point O, which allows us to determine the direction of the fields E1E1 and E2E2.

Now arrows are drawn to represent the magnitudes and directions of E1E1 and E2E2. (See Figure 18.21.) The direction of the electric field is that of the force on a positive charge so both arrows point directly away from the positive charges that create them.

Page 208,"The best example of this charge screening is the water molecule, represented as H2OH2O. Water is a strongly polar molecule. Its 10 electrons (8 from the oxygen atom and 2 from the two hydrogen atoms) tend to remain closer to the oxygen nucleus than the hydrogen nuclei. This creates two centers of equal and opposite charges—what is called a dipole, as illustrated in Figure 18.25. The magnitude of the dipole is called the dipole moment. H2OH2O polar molecule dipole These two centers of charge will terminate some of the electric field lines coming from a free charge, as on a DNA molecule. This results in a reduction in the strength of the Coulomb interaction. One might say that screening makes the Coulomb force a short range force rather than long range. Coulomb interaction Other ions of importance in biology that can reduce or screen Coulomb interactions are Na+,Na+, and K+,K+, and Cl–Cl–.

Page 209,"A near uniform electric field of approximately 150 N/C, directed downward, surrounds Earth, with the magnitude increasing slightly as we get closer to the surface. What causes the electric field? At around 100 km above the surface of Earth we have a layer of charged particles, called the ionosphere. The ionosphere is responsible for a range of phenomena including the electric field surrounding Earth. In fair weather the ionosphere is positive and the Earth largely negative, maintaining the electric field (Figure 18.30(a)). ionosphere In storm conditions clouds form and localized electric fields can be larger and reversed in direction (Figure 18.30(b)). The exact charge distributions depend on the local conditions, and variations of Figure 18.30(b) are possible. If the electric field is sufficiently large, the insulating properties of the surrounding material break down and it becomes conducting. For air this occurs at around 3×1063×106 N/C. Air ionizes ions and electrons recombine, and we get discharge in the form of lightning sparks and corona discharge. 3×1063×106 Figure 18.30 Earth’s electric field. (a) Fair weather field.

Page 209,"So far we have considered excess charges on a smooth, symmetrical conductor surface. What happens if a conductor has sharp corners or is pointed? Excess charges on a nonuniform conductor become concentrated at the sharpest points. Additionally, excess charge may move on or off the conductor at the sharpest points. To see how and why this happens, consider the charged conductor in Figure 18.31. The electrostatic repulsion of like charges is most effective in moving them apart on the flattest surface, and so they become least concentrated there. This is because the forces between identical pairs of charges at either end of the conductor are identical, but the components of the forces parallel to the surfaces are different. The component parallel to the surface is greatest on the flattest surface and, hence, more effective in moving the charge. The same effect is produced on a conductor by an externally applied electric field, as seen in Figure 18.31 (c). Since the field lines must be perpendicular to the surface, more of them are concentrated on the most curved parts. Figure 18.31 Excess charge on a nonuniform conductor becomes most concentrated at the location of greatest curvature. (a) The forces between identical pairs of charges at either end of the conductor are identical, but the components of the forces parallel to the surface are different. It is F∥F∥ that moves the charges apart once they have reached the surface. (b) F∥F∥ is smallest at the more pointed end, the charges are left closer together, producing the electric field shown. (c) An uncharged conductor in an originally uniform electric field is polarized, with the most concentrated charge at its most pointed end."
Page 209,"On a very sharply curved surface, such as shown in Figure 18.32, the charges are so concentrated at the point that the resulting electric field can be great enough to remove them from the surface. This can be useful. Lightning rods work best when they are most pointed. The large charges created in storm clouds induce an opposite charge on a building that can result in a lightning bolt hitting the building. The induced charge is bled away continually by a lightning rod, preventing the more dramatic lightning strike. Of course, we sometimes wish to prevent the transfer of charge rather than to facilitate it. In that case, the conductor should be very smooth and have as large a radius of curvature as possible. (See Figure 18.33.) Smooth surfaces are used on high-voltage transmission lines, for example, to avoid leakage of charge into the air. Another device that makes use of some of these principles is a Faraday cage. This is a metal shield that encloses a volume. All electrical charges will reside on the outside surface of this shield, and there will be no electrical field inside. A Faraday cage is used to prohibit stray electrical fields in the environment from interfering with sensitive measurements, such as the electrical signals inside a nerve cell. Faraday cage During electrical storms if you are driving a car, it is best to stay inside the car as its metal body acts as a Faraday cage with zero electrical field inside. If in the vicinity of a lightning strike, its effect is felt on the outside of the car and the inside is unaffected, provided you remain totally inside. This is also true if an active (“hot”) electrical wire was broken (in a storm or an accident) and fell on your car. Figure 18.32 A very pointed conductor has a large charge concentration at the point. The electric field is very strong at the point and can exert a force large enough to transfer charge on or off the conductor. Lightning rods are used to prevent the buildup of large excess charges on structures and, thus, are pointed. Figure 18.33 (a) A lightning rod is pointed to facilitate the transfer of charge.

The first was built by Robert Van de Graaff in 1931 (based on original suggestions by Lord Kelvin) for use in nuclear physics research. Figure 18.34 shows a schematic of a large research version. Van de Graaffs utilize both smooth and pointed surfaces, and conductors and insulators to generate large static charges and, hence, large voltages. Van de Graaff generators A very large excess charge can be deposited on the sphere, because it moves quickly to the outer surface. Practical limits arise because the large electric fields polarize and eventually ionize surrounding materials, creating free charges that neutralize excess charge or allow it to escape. Nevertheless, voltages of 15 million volts are well within practical limits. Figure 18.34 Schematic of Van de Graaff generator. A battery (A) supplies excess positive charge to a pointed conductor, the points of which spray the charge onto a moving insulating belt near the bottom. The pointed conductor (B) on top in the large sphere picks up the charge. (The induced electric field at the points is so large that it removes the charge from the belt.) This can be done because the charge does not remain inside the conducting sphere but moves to its outside surface. An ion source inside the sphere produces positive ions, which are accelerated away from the positive sphere to high velocities.

The heart of the process is shown in simplified form in Figure 18.35. xerography A selenium-coated aluminum drum is sprayed with positive charge from points on a device called a corotron. Selenium is a substance with an interesting property—it is a photoconductor. That is, selenium is an insulator when in the dark and a conductor when exposed to light. photoconductor In the first stage of the xerography process, the conducting aluminum drum is grounded so that a negative charge is induced under the thin layer of uniformly positively charged selenium. In the second stage, the surface of the drum is exposed to the image of whatever is to be copied. Where the image is light, the selenium becomes conducting, and the positive charge is neutralized. In dark areas, the positive charge remains, and so the image has been transferred to the drum. grounded The third stage takes a dry black powder, called toner, and sprays it with a negative charge so that it will be attracted to the positive regions of the drum. Next, a blank piece of paper is given a greater positive charge than on the drum so that it will pull the toner from the drum. Finally, the paper and electrostatically held toner are passed through heated pressure rollers, which melt and permanently adhere the toner within the fibers of the paper. Figure 18.35 Xerography is a dry copying process based on electrostatics. The major steps in the process are the charging of the photoconducting drum, transfer of an image creating a positive charge duplicate, attraction of toner to the charged parts of the drum, and transfer of toner to the paper. Not shown are heat treatment of the paper and cleansing of the drum for the next copy."

Suppose a tiny drop of gasoline has a mass of 4.00×10–15kg4.00×10–15kg  and is given a positive charge of 3.20×10–19C3.20×10–19C. (a) Find the weight of the drop. (b) Calculate the electric force on the drop if there is an upward electric field of strength 3.00×105N/C3.00×105N/C  due to other static electricity in the vicinity. (c) Calculate the drop’s acceleration. 4.00×10–15kg4.00×10–15kg 3.20×10–19C3.20×10–19C 3.00×105N/C3.00×105N/C To solve an integrated concept problem, we must first identify the physical principles involved and identify the chapters in which they are found. Part (a) of this example asks for weight. This is a topic of dynamics and is defined in Dynamics: Force and Newton’s Laws of Motion. Part (b) deals with electric force on a charge, a topic of Electric Charge and Electric Field. Part (c) asks for acceleration, knowing forces and mass. These are part of Newton’s laws, also found in Dynamics: Force and Newton’s Laws of Motion. The following solutions to each part of the example illustrate how the specific problem-solving strategies are applied. These involve identifying knowns and unknowns, checking to see if the answer is reasonable, and so on. Weight is mass times the acceleration due to gravity, as first expressed in 18.20 Entering the given mass and the average acceleration due to gravity yields 18.21 This is a small weight, consistent with the small mass of the drop. The force an electric field exerts on a charge is given by rearranging the following equation: 18.22 Here we are given the charge (3.20×10–19C3.20×10–19C  is twice the fundamental unit of charge) and the electric field strength, and so the electric force is found to be 3.20×10–19C3.20×10–19C 18.23 While this is a small force, it is greater than the weight of the drop. The acceleration can be found using Newton’s second law, provided we can identify all of the external forces acting on the drop. We assume only the drop’s weight and the electric force are significant. Since the drop has a positive charge and the electric field is given to be upward, the electric force is upward. We thus have a one-dimensional (vertical direction) problem, and we can state Newton’s second law as 18.24 where 
F
net=F−w
F
net=F−w. Entering this and the known values into the expression for Newton’s second law yields F
net=F−w
F
net=F−w 18.25 This is an upward acceleration great enough to carry the drop to places where you might not wish to have gasoline. This worked example illustrates how to apply problem-solving strategies to situations that include topics in different chapters. The first step is to identify the physical principles involved in the problem. The second step is to solve for the unknown using familiar problem-solving strategies. These are found throughout the text, and many worked examples show how to use them for single topics. In this integrated concepts example, you can see how to apply them across several topics. You will find these techniques useful in applications of physics outside a physics course, such as in your profession, in other science disciplines, and in everyday life. The following problems will build your skills in the broad application of physical principles. Unreasonable Results The Unreasonable Results exercises for this module have results that are unreasonable because some premise is unreasonable or because certain of the premises are inconsistent with one another. Physical principles applied correctly then produce unreasonable results. The purpose of these problems is to give practice in assessing whether nature is being accurately described, and if it is not to trace the source of difficulty. Problem-Solving Strategy To determine if an answer is reasonable, and to determine the cause if it is not, do the following."

Construct Your Own Problem Construct Your Own Problem Consider two insulating balls with evenly distributed equal and opposite charges on their surfaces, held with a certain distance between the centers of the balls. Construct a problem in which you calculate the electric field (magnitude and direction) due to the balls at various points along a line running through the centers of the balls and extending to infinity on either side. Choose interesting points and comment on the meaning of the field at those points. For example, at what points might the field be just that due to one ball and where does the field become negligibly small? Among the things to be considered are the magnitudes of the charges and the distance between the centers of the balls.

Page 216,"The energy per electron is very small in macroscopic situations like that in the previous example—a tiny fraction of a joule. But on a submicroscopic scale, such energy per particle (electron, proton, or ion) can be of great importance. For example, even a tiny fraction of a joule can be great enough for these particles to destroy organic molecules and harm living tissue. The particle may do its damage by direct collision, or it may create harmful x rays, which can also inflict damage. It is useful to have an energy unit related to submicroscopic effects. Figure 19.4 shows a situation related to the definition of such an energy unit. An electron is accelerated between two charged metal plates as it might be in an old-model television tube or oscilloscope. The electron is given kinetic energy that is later converted to another form—light in the television tube, for example. (Note that downhill for the electron is uphill for a positive charge.) Since energy is related to voltage by ΔPE=qΔV,ΔPE=qΔV, we can think of the joule as a coulomb-volt. ΔPE=qΔV,ΔPE=qΔV, Figure 19.4 A typical electron gun accelerates electrons using a potential difference between two metal plates. The energy of the electron in electron volts is numerically the same as the voltage between the plates. For example, a 5000 V potential difference produces 5000 eV electrons. On the submicroscopic scale, it is more convenient to define an energy unit called the electron volt (eV), which is the energy given to a fundamental charge accelerated through a potential difference of 1 V.  In equation form, electron volt 19.13 Electron Volt On the submicroscopic scale, it is more convenient to define an energy unit called the electron volt (eV), which is the energy given to a fundamental charge accelerated through a potential difference of 1 V. In equation form, 19.14 An electron accelerated through a potential difference of 1 V is given an energy of 1 eV. It follows that an electron accelerated through 50 V is given 50 eV. A potential difference of 100,000 V (100 kV) will give an electron an energy of 100,000 eV (100 keV), and so on. Similarly, an ion with a double positive charge accelerated through 100 V will be given 200 eV of energy. These simple relationships between accelerating voltage and particle charges make the electron volt a simple and convenient energy unit in such circumstances. Connections: Energy Units The electron volt (eV) is the most common energy unit for submicroscopic processes. This will be particularly noticeable in the chapters on modern physics. Energy is so important to so many subjects that there is a tendency to define a special energy unit for each major topic. There are, for example, calories for food energy, kilowatt-hours for electrical energy, and therms for natural gas energy. The electron volt is commonly employed in submicroscopic processes—chemical valence energies and molecular and nuclear binding energies are among the quantities often expressed in electron volts. For example, about 5 eV of energy is required to break up certain organic molecules. If a proton is accelerated from rest through a potential difference of 30 kV, it is given an energy of 30 keV (30,000 eV) and it can break up as many as 6000 of these molecules (30,000 eV ÷  5 eV per molecule= 6000 molecules30,000 eV ÷  5 eV per molecule= 6000 molecules). Nuclear decay energies are on the order of 1 MeV (1,000,000 eV) per event and can, thus, produce significant biological damage. 30,000 eV ÷  5 eV per molecule= 6000 molecules30,000 eV ÷  5 eV per molecule= 6000 molecules"
Page 216,"The total energy of a system is conserved if there is no net addition (or subtraction) of work or heat transfer. For conservative forces, such as the electrostatic force, conservation of energy states that mechanical energy is a constant. Mechanical energy is the sum of the kinetic energy and potential energy of a system; that is, KE+PE = constantKE+PE = constant. A loss of PE of a charged particle becomes an increase in its KE. Here PE is the electric potential energy. Conservation of energy is stated in equation form as Mechanical energy KE+PE = constantKE+PE = constant 19.15 or 19.16 where i and f stand for initial and final conditions. As we have found many times before, considering energy can give us insights and facilitate problem solving. Example 19.3 Calculate the final speed of a free electron accelerated from rest through a potential difference of 100 V. (Assume that this numerical value is accurate to three significant figures.) We have a system with only conservative forces. Assuming the electron is accelerated in a vacuum, and neglecting the gravitational force (we will check on this assumption later), all of the electrical potential energy is converted into kinetic energy.

From the discussions in Electric Charge and Electric Field, we know that electrostatic forces on small particles are generally very large compared with the gravitational force. The large final speed confirms that the gravitational force is indeed negligible here. The large speed also indicates how easy it is to accelerate electrons with small voltages because of their very small mass. Voltages much higher than the 100 V in this problem are typically used in electron guns. Those higher voltages produce electron speeds so great that relativistic effects must be taken into account. That is why a low voltage is considered (accurately) in this example."

When a voltage VV is applied to the capacitor, it stores a charge QQ, as shown. We can see how its capacitance depends on AA and dd by considering the characteristics of the Coulomb force. We know that like charges repel, unlike charges attract, and the force between charges decreases with distance. So it seems quite reasonable that the bigger the plates are, the more charge they can store—because the charges can spread out more. Thus CC should be greater for larger AA.

Page 220,"The previous example highlights the difficulty of storing a large amount of charge in capacitors. If dd is made smaller to produce a larger capacitance, then the maximum voltage must be reduced proportionally to avoid breakdown (since E=V/dE=V/d). An important solution to this difficulty is to put an insulating material, called a dielectric, between the plates of a capacitor and allow 


d

     to be as small as possible. Not only does the smaller dd make the capacitance greater, but many insulators can withstand greater electric fields than air before breaking down. dd E=V/dE=V/d dielectric d





d dd There is another benefit to using a dielectric in a capacitor. Depending on the material used, the capacitance is greater than that given by the equation C=ε0AdC=ε0Ad by a factor κκ, called the dielectric constant. A parallel plate capacitor with a dielectric between its plates has a capacitance given by C=ε0AdC=ε0Ad κκ 19.57 Values of the dielectric constant κκ for various materials are given in Table 19.1. Note that κκ for vacuum is exactly 1, and so the above equation is valid in that case, too. If a dielectric is used, perhaps by placing Teflon between the plates of the capacitor in Example 19.8, then the capacitance is greater by the factor κκ, which for Teflon is 2.1. κκ κκ κκ Take-Home Experiment: Building a Capacitor How large a capacitor can you make using a chewing gum wrapper? The plates will be the aluminum foil, and the separation (dielectric) in between will be the paper. Table 19.1 Dielectric Constants and Dielectric Strengths for Various Materials at 20ºC Note also that the dielectric constant for air is very close to 1, so that air-filled capacitors act much like those with vacuum between their plates except that the air can become conductive if the electric field strength  becomes too great. (Recall that E=V/dE=V/d for a parallel plate capacitor.) Also shown in Table 19.1 are maximum electric field strengths in V/m, called dielectric strengths, for several materials. These are the fields above which the material begins to break down and conduct. The dielectric strength imposes a limit on the voltage that can be applied for a given plate separation. For instance, in Example 19.8, the separation is 1.00 mm, and so the voltage limit for air is E=V/dE=V/d dielectric strengths 19.58 However, the limit for a 1.00 mm separation filled with Teflon is 60,000 V, since the dielectric strength of Teflon is 60×10660×106 V/m. So the same capacitor filled with Teflon has a greater capacitance and can be subjected to a much greater voltage. Using the capacitance we calculated in the above example for the air-filled parallel plate capacitor, we find that the Teflon-filled capacitor can store a maximum charge of 60×10660×106 19.59 This is 42 times the charge of the same air-filled capacitor. Dielectric Strength The maximum electric field strength above which an insulating material begins to break down and conduct is called its dielectric strength. Microscopically, how does a dielectric increase capacitance? Polarization of the insulator is responsible. The more easily it is polarized, the greater its dielectric constant κκ. Water, for example, is a polar molecule because one end of the molecule has a slight positive charge and the other end has a slight negative charge. The polarity of water causes it to have a relatively large dielectric constant of 80. The effect of polarization can be best explained in terms of the characteristics of the Coulomb force. Figure 19.16 shows the separation of charge schematically in the molecules of a dielectric material placed between the charged plates of a capacitor. The Coulomb force between the closest ends of the molecules and the charge on the plates is attractive and very strong, since they are very close together. This attracts more charge onto the plates than if the space were empty and the opposite charges were a distance dd away. κκ polar molecule dd Figure 19.16 (a) The molecules in the insulating material between the plates of a capacitor are polarized by the charged plates. This produces a layer of opposite charge on the surface of the dielectric that attracts more charge onto the plate, increasing its capacitance. (b) The dielectric reduces the electric field strength inside the capacitor, resulting in a smaller voltage between the plates for the same charge. The capacitor stores the same charge for a smaller voltage, implying that it has a larger capacitance because of the dielectric. Another way to understand how a dielectric increases capacitance is to consider its effect on the electric field inside the capacitor. Figure 19.16(b) shows the electric field lines with a dielectric in place. Since the field lines end on charges in the dielectric, there are fewer of them going from one side of the capacitor to the other. So the electric field strength is less than if there were a vacuum between the plates, even though the same charge is on the plates. The voltage between the plates is V=EdV=Ed, so it too is reduced by the dielectric. Thus there is a smaller voltage VV for the same charge QQ; since C=Q/VC=Q/V, the capacitance CC is greater. V=EdV=Ed VV QQ C=Q/VC=Q/V CC The dielectric constant is generally defined to be κ=E0/Eκ=E0/E, or the ratio of the electric field in a vacuum to that in the dielectric material, and is intimately related to the polarizability of the material. κ=E0/Eκ=E0/E Things Great and Small The Submicroscopic Origin of Polarization Polarization is a separation of charge within an atom or molecule. As has been noted, the planetary model of the atom pictures it as having a positive nucleus orbited by negative electrons, analogous to the planets orbiting the Sun. Although this model is not completely accurate, it is very helpful in explaining a vast range of phenomena and will be refined elsewhere, such as in Atomic Physics. The submicroscopic origin of polarization can be modeled as shown in Figure 19.17. Figure 19.17 Artist’s conception of a polarized atom. The orbits of electrons around the nucleus are shifted slightly by the external charges (shown exaggerated). The resulting separation of charge within the atom means that it is polarized. Note that the unlike charge is now closer to the external charges, causing the polarization. We will find in Atomic Physics that the orbits of electrons are more properly viewed as electron clouds with the density of the cloud related to the probability of finding an electron in that location (as opposed to the definite locations and paths of planets in their orbits around the Sun). This cloud is shifted by the Coulomb force so that the atom on average has a separation of charge. Although the atom remains neutral, it can now be the source of a Coulomb force, since a charge brought near the atom will be closer to one type of charge than the other. Some molecules, such as those of water, have an inherent separation of charge and are thus called polar molecules. Figure 19.18 illustrates the separation of charge in a water molecule, which has two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom H2OH2O. The water molecule is not symmetric—the hydrogen atoms are repelled to one side, giving the molecule a boomerang shape. The electrons in a water molecule are more concentrated around the more highly charged oxygen nucleus than around the hydrogen nuclei. This makes the oxygen end of the molecule slightly negative and leaves the hydrogen ends slightly positive. The inherent separation of charge in polar molecules makes it easier to align them with external fields and charges. Polar molecules therefore exhibit greater polarization effects and have greater dielectric constants. Those who study chemistry will find that the polar nature of water has many effects. For example, water molecules gather ions much more effectively because they have an electric field and a separation of charge to attract charges of both signs. Also, as brought out in the previous chapter, polar water provides a shield or screening of the electric fields in the highly charged molecules of interest in biological systems. H2OH2O Figure 19.18 Artist’s conception of a water molecule. There is an inherent separation of charge, and so water is a polar molecule. Electrons in the molecule are attracted to the oxygen nucleus and leave an excess of positive charge near the two hydrogen nuclei. (Note that the schematic on the right is a rough illustration of the distribution of electrons in the water molecule.

Page 221,"Figure 19.19(a) shows a series connection of three capacitors with a voltage applied. As for any capacitor, the capacitance of the combination is related to charge and voltage by C=QVC=QV. C=QVC=QV Note in Figure 19.19 that opposite charges of magnitude QQ flow to either side of the originally uncharged combination of capacitors when the voltage VV is applied. Conservation of charge requires that equal-magnitude charges be created on the plates of the individual capacitors, since charge is only being separated in these originally neutral devices. The end result is that the combination resembles a single capacitor with an effective plate separation greater than that of the individual capacitors alone. (See Figure 19.19(b).) Larger plate separation means smaller capacitance. It is a general feature of series connections of capacitors that the total capacitance is less than any of the individual capacitances.

Q. (b) An equivalent capacitor has a larger plate separation dd. Series connections produce a total capacitance that is less than that of any of the individual capacitors. We can find an expression for the total capacitance by considering the voltage across the individual capacitors shown in Figure 19.19. Solving C=QVC=QV for VV gives V=QCV=QC. The voltages across the individual capacitors are thus V1=QC1V1=QC1, V2=QC2V2=QC2, and V3=QC3V3=QC3. The total voltage is the sum of the individual voltages: C=QVC=QV VV V=QCV=QC V1=QC1V1=QC1 V2=QC2V2=QC2 V3=QC3V3=QC3 19.60 Now, calling the total capacitance CSCS for series capacitance, consider that CSCS 19.61 Entering the expressions for V1V1, V2V2, and V3V3, we get V1V1 V2V2 V3V3 19.62 Canceling the QQs, we obtain the equation for the total capacitance in series CSCS to be QQ CSCS 19.63 where “...” indicates that the expression is valid for any number of capacitors connected in series.

Page 221,"Figure 19.20(a) shows a parallel connection of three capacitors with a voltage applied. Here the total capacitance is easier to find than in the series case. To find the equivalent total capacitance CpCp, we first note that the voltage across each capacitor is VV, the same as that of the source, since they are connected directly to it through a conductor. (Conductors are equipotentials, and so the voltage across the capacitors is the same as that across the voltage source.) Thus the capacitors have the same charges on them as they would have if connected individually to the voltage source. The total charge QQ is the sum of the individual charges: CpCp VV QQ 19.67 Figure 19.20 (a) Capacitors in parallel. Each is connected directly to the voltage source just as if it were all alone, and so the total capacitance in parallel is just the sum of the individual capacitances. (b) The equivalent capacitor has a larger plate area and can therefore hold more charge than the individual capacitors. Using the relationship Q=CVQ=CV, we see that the total charge is Q=CpVQ=CpV, and the individual charges are Q1=C1VQ1=C1V, Q2=C2VQ2=C2V, and Q3=C3VQ3=C3V.

(See Figure 19.21.) To find the total capacitance of such combinations, we identify series and parallel parts, compute their capacitances, and then find the total. Figure 19.21 (a) This circuit contains both series and parallel connections of capacitors. See Example 19.10 for the calculation of the overall capacitance of the circuit. (b) C1C1 and C2C2 are in series; their equivalent capacitance CSCS is less than either of them. (c) Note that CSCS is in parallel with C3C3. The total capacitance is, thus, the sum of CSCS and C3C3. Example 19.10 Find the total capacitance of the combination of capacitors shown in Figure 19.21. Assume the capacitances in Figure 19.21 are known to three decimal places (
C1=1.000 µFC1=1.000 µF,  C2=5.000 µFC2=5.000 µF, and  C3=8.000 µFC3=8.000 µF), and round your answer to three decimal places. C1=1.000 µFC1=1.000 µF C2=5.000 µFC2=5.000 µF C3=8.000 µFC3=8.000 µF To find the total capacitance, we first identify which capacitors are in series and which are in parallel. Capacitors C1C1 and C2C2 are in series. Their combination, labeled CSCS in the figure, is in parallel with C3C3. C1C1 C2C2 CSCS C3C3 Since C1C1 and C2C2 are in series, their total capacitance is given by 1CS=1C1+1C2+1C31CS=1C1+1C2+1C3.

Page 222,"Most of us have seen dramatizations in which medical personnel use a defibrillator to pass an electric current through a patient’s heart to get it to beat normally. (Review Figure 19.22.) Often realistic in detail, the person applying the shock directs another person to “make it 400 joules this time.” The energy delivered by the defibrillator is stored in a capacitor and can be adjusted to fit the situation. SI units of joules are often employed. Less dramatic is the use of capacitors in microelectronics, such as certain handheld calculators, to supply energy when batteries are charged. (See Figure 19.22.) Capacitors are also used to supply energy for flash lamps on cameras. defibrillator Figure 19.22 Energy stored in the large capacitor is used to preserve the memory of an electronic calculator when its batteries are charged. (credit: Kucharek, Wikimedia Commons) Energy stored in a capacitor is electrical potential energy, and it is thus related to the charge QQ and voltage VV on the capacitor. We must be careful when applying the equation for electrical potential energy ΔPE=qΔVΔPE=qΔV to a capacitor. Remember that ΔPEΔPE is the potential energy of a charge qq going through a voltage ΔVΔV. But the capacitor starts with zero voltage and gradually comes up to its full voltage as it is charged. The first charge placed on a capacitor experiences a change in voltage ΔV=0ΔV=0, since the capacitor has zero voltage when uncharged. The final charge placed on a capacitor experiences ΔV=VΔV=V, since the capacitor now has its full voltage VV on it. The average voltage on the capacitor during the charging process is V/2V/2, and so the average voltage experienced by the full charge qq is V/2V/2. Thus the energy stored in a capacitor, EcapEcap, is QQ VV ΔPE=qΔVΔPE=qΔV ΔPEΔPE qq ΔVΔV ΔV=0ΔV=0 ΔV=VΔV=V VV V/2V/2 qq V/2V/2 EcapEcap 19.74 where QQ is the charge on a capacitor with a voltage VV applied. (Note that the energy is not QVQV, but QV/2QV/2.) Charge and voltage  are related to the capacitance

QQ VV CC Energy Stored in Capacitors The energy stored in a capacitor can be expressed in three ways: 19.76 where QQ is the charge, VV is the voltage, and CC is the capacitance of the capacitor. The energy is in joules for a charge in coulombs, voltage in volts, and capacitance in farads. QQ VV CC In a defibrillator, the delivery of a large charge in a short burst to a set of paddles across a person’s chest can be a lifesaver. The person’s heart attack might have arisen from the onset of fast, irregular beating of the heart—cardiac or ventricular fibrillation. The application of a large shock of electrical energy can terminate the arrhythmia and allow the body’s pacemaker to resume normal patterns. Today it is common for ambulances to carry a defibrillator, which also uses an electrocardiogram to analyze the patient’s heartbeat pattern. Automated external defibrillators (AED) are found in many public places (Figure 19.23). These are designed to be used by lay persons. The device automatically diagnoses the patient’s heart condition and then applies the shock with appropriate energy and waveform. CPR is recommended in many cases before use of an AED. Figure 19.23 Automated external defibrillators are found in many public places. These portable units provide verbal instructions for use in the important first few minutes for a person suffering a cardiac attack.

Page 228,"Electric current is defined to be the rate at which charge flows. A large current, such as that used to start a truck engine, moves a large amount of charge in a small time, whereas a small current, such as that used to operate a hand-held calculator, moves a small amount of charge over a long period of time. In equation form, electric current II is defined to be electric current II 20.1 where ΔQΔQ is the amount of charge passing through a given area in time ΔtΔt. (As in previous chapters, initial time is often taken to be zero, in which case Δt=tΔt=t.) (See Figure 20.2.) The SI unit for current is the ampere (A), named for the French physicist André-Marie Ampère (1775–1836). Since I=ΔQ/ΔtI=ΔQ/Δt, we see that an ampere is one coulomb per second: ΔQΔQ ΔtΔt Δt=tΔt=t ampere I=ΔQ/ΔtI=ΔQ/Δt 20.2 Not only are fuses and circuit breakers rated in amperes (or amps), so are many electrical appliances. Figure 20.2 The rate of flow of charge is current. An ampere is the flow of one coulomb through an area in one second. Example 20.1 (a) What is the current involved when a truck battery sets in motion 720 C of charge in 4.00 s while starting an engine? (b) How long does it take 1.00 C of charge to flow through a handheld calculator if a 0.300-mA current is flowing? We can use the definition of current in the equation I=ΔQ/ΔtI=ΔQ/Δt to find the current in part (a), since charge and time are given. In part (b), we rearrange the definition of current and use the given values of charge and current to find the time required. I=ΔQ/ΔtI=ΔQ/Δt Entering the given values for charge and time into the definition of current gives 20.3 This large value for current illustrates the fact that a large charge is moved in a small amount of time. The currents in these “starter motors” are fairly large because large frictional forces need to be overcome when setting something in motion. Solving the relationship I=ΔQ/ΔtI=ΔQ/Δt for time ΔtΔt, and entering the known values for charge and current gives I=ΔQ/ΔtI=ΔQ/Δt ΔtΔt 20.4 This time is slightly less than an hour. The small current used by the hand-held calculator takes a much longer time to move a smaller charge than the large current of the truck starter. So why can we operate our calculators only seconds after turning them on? It’s because calculators require very little energy. Such small current and energy demands allow handheld calculators to operate from solar cells or to get many hours of use out of small batteries. Remember, calculators do not have moving parts in the same way that a truck engine has with cylinders and pistons, so the technology requires smaller currents. Figure 20.3 shows a simple circuit and the standard schematic representation of a battery, conducting path, and load (a resistor). Schematics are very useful in visualizing the main features of a circuit. A single schematic can represent a wide variety of situations. The schematic in Figure 20.3 (b), for example, can represent anything from a truck battery connected to a headlight lighting the street in front of the truck to a small battery connected to a penlight lighting a keyhole in a door. Such schematics are useful because the analysis is the same for a wide variety of situations. We need to understand a few schematics to apply the concepts and analysis to many more situations. Figure 20.3 (a) A simple electric circuit. A closed path for current to flow through is supplied by conducting wires connecting a load to the terminals of a battery. (b) In this schematic, the battery is represented by the two parallel red lines, conducting wires are shown as straight lines, and the zigzag represents the load. The schematic represents a wide variety of similar circuits. Note that the direction of current flow in Figure 20.3 is from positive to negative. The direction of conventional current is the direction that positive charge would flow. Depending on the situation, positive charges, negative charges, or both may move. In metal wires, for example, current is carried by electrons—that is, negative charges move. In ionic solutions, such as salt water, both positive and negative charges move. This is also true in nerve cells. A Van de Graaff generator used for nuclear research can produce a current of pure positive charges, such as protons. Figure 20.4 illustrates the movement of charged particles that compose a current. The fact that conventional current is taken to be in the direction that positive charge would flow can be traced back to American politician and scientist Benjamin Franklin in the 1700s. He named the type of charge associated with electrons negative, long before they were known to carry current in so many situations. Franklin, in fact, was totally unaware of the small-scale structure of electricity. It is important to realize that there is an electric field in conductors responsible for producing the current, as illustrated in Figure 20.4. Unlike static electricity, where a conductor in equilibrium cannot have an electric field in it, conductors carrying a current have an electric field and are not in static equilibrium. An electric field is needed to supply energy to move the charges. Making Connections: Take-Home Investigation—Electric Current Illustration Find a straw and little peas that can move freely in the straw. Place the straw flat on a table and fill the straw with peas. When you pop one pea in at one end, a different pea should pop out the other end. This demonstration is an analogy for an electric current. Identify what compares to the electrons and what compares to the supply of energy. What other analogies can you find for an electric current? Note that the flow of peas is based on the peas physically bumping into each other; electrons flow due to mutually repulsive electrostatic forces. Figure 20.4 Current II is the rate at which charge moves through an area

A, such as the cross-section of a wire. Conventional current is defined to move in the direction of the electric field. (a) Positive charges move in the direction of the electric field and the same direction as conventional current. (b) Negative charges move in the direction opposite to the electric field. Conventional current is in the direction opposite to the movement of negative charge. The flow of electrons is sometimes referred to as electronic flow. Example 20.2 If the 0.300-mA current through the calculator mentioned in the Example 20.1 example is carried by electrons, how many electrons per second pass through it? The current calculated in the previous example was defined for the flow of positive charge. For electrons, the magnitude is the same, but the sign is opposite,

) –1.60×10−19C–1.60×10−19C Starting with the definition of current, we have 20.5 We divide this by the charge per electron, so that 20.6 There are so many charged particles moving, even in small currents, that individual charges are not noticed, just as individual water molecules are not noticed in water flow. Even more amazing is that they do not always keep moving forward like soldiers in a parade. Rather they are like a crowd of people with movement in different directions but a general trend to move forward. There are lots of collisions with atoms in the metal wire and, of course, with other electrons."

(b) How long does it take 1.00 C of charge to flow through a handheld calculator if a 0.300-mA current is flowing?

Page 228,"Electrical signals are known to move very rapidly. Telephone conversations carried by currents in wires cover large distances without noticeable delays. Lights come on as soon as a switch is flicked. Most electrical signals carried by currents travel at speeds on the order of 108m/s108m/s, a significant fraction of the speed of light. Interestingly, the individual charges that make up the current move much more slowly on average, typically drifting at speeds on the order of 10−4m/s10−4m/s. How do we reconcile these two speeds, and what does it tell us about standard conductors? 108m/s108m/s 10−4m/s10−4m/s The high speed of electrical signals results from the fact that the force between charges acts rapidly at a distance. Thus, when a free charge is forced into a wire, as in Figure 20.5, the incoming charge pushes other charges ahead of it, which in turn push on charges farther down the line. The density of charge in a system cannot easily be increased, and so the signal is passed on rapidly. The resulting electrical shock wave moves through the system at nearly the speed of light. To be precise, this rapidly moving signal or shock wave is a rapidly propagating change in electric field. Figure 20.5 When charged particles are forced into this volume of a conductor, an equal number are quickly forced to leave. The repulsion between like charges makes it difficult to increase the number of charges in a volume. Thus, as one charge enters, another leaves almost immediately, carrying the signal rapidly forward. Good conductors have large numbers of free charges in them. In metals, the free charges are free electrons. Figure 20.6 shows how free electrons move through an ordinary conductor. The distance that an individual electron can move between collisions with atoms or other electrons is quite small. The electron paths thus appear nearly random, like the motion of atoms in a gas. But there is an electric field in the conductor that causes the electrons to drift in the direction shown (opposite to the field, since they are negative). The drift velocity vdvd is the average velocity of the free charges. Drift velocity is quite small, since there are so many free charges. If we have an estimate of the density of free electrons in a conductor, we can calculate the drift velocity for a given current. The larger the density, the lower the velocity required for a given current. drift velocity vdvd Figure 20.6 Free electrons moving in a conductor make many collisions with other electrons and atoms. The path of one electron is shown. The average velocity of the free charges is called the drift velocity, vdvd, and it is in the direction opposite to the electric field for electrons. The collisions normally transfer energy to the conductor, requiring a constant supply of energy to maintain a steady current. Conduction of Electricity and Heat Good electrical conductors are often good heat conductors, too. This is because large numbers of free electrons can carry electrical current and can transport thermal energy. The free-electron collisions transfer energy to the atoms of the conductor. The electric field does work in moving the electrons through a distance, but that work does not increase the kinetic energy (nor speed, therefore) of the electrons. The work is transferred to the conductor’s atoms, possibly increasing temperature. Thus a continuous power input is required to keep a current flowing. An exception, of course, is found in superconductors, for reasons we shall explore in a later chapter. Superconductors can have a steady current without a continual supply of energy—a great energy savings. In contrast, the supply of energy can be useful, such as in a lightbulb filament. The supply of energy is necessary to increase the temperature of the tungsten filament, so that the filament glows. Making Connections: Take-Home Investigation—Filament Observations Find a lightbulb with a filament. Look carefully at the filament and describe its structure. To what points is the filament connected? We can obtain an expression for the relationship between current and drift velocity by considering the number of free charges in a segment of wire, as illustrated in Figure 20.7. The number of free charges per unit volume is given the symbol nn and depends on the material. The shaded segment has a volume AxAx, so that the number of free charges in it is nAxnAx. The charge ΔQΔQ in this segment is thus qnAxqnAx, where qq is the amount of charge on each carrier. (Recall that for electrons, qq is −1.60×10−19C−1.60×10−19C.) Current is charge moved per unit time; thus, if all the original charges move out of this segment in time ΔtΔt, the current is nn AxAx nAxnAx ΔQΔQ qnAxqnAx qq qq −1.60×10−19C−1.60×10−19C ΔtΔt 20.7 Note that x/Δtx/Δt is the magnitude of the drift velocity,

II AA nn qq vdvd Figure 20.7 All the charges in the shaded volume of this wire move out in a time tt, having a drift velocity of magnitude vd=x/tvd=x/t. See text for further discussion. Note that simple drift velocity is not the entire story. The speed of an electron is much greater than its drift velocity. In addition, not all of the electrons in a conductor can move freely, and those that do might move somewhat faster or slower than the drift velocity. So what do we mean by free electrons? Atoms in a metallic conductor are packed in the form of a lattice structure. Some electrons are far enough away from the atomic nuclei that they do not experience the attraction of the nuclei as much as the inner electrons do. These are the free electrons. They are not bound to a single atom but can instead move freely among the atoms in a “sea” of electrons. These free electrons respond by accelerating when an electric field is applied. Of course as they move they collide with the atoms in the lattice and other electrons, generating thermal energy, and the conductor gets warmer. In an insulator, the organization of the atoms and the structure do not allow for such free electrons. Example 20.3 Calculate the drift velocity of electrons in a 12-gauge copper wire (which has a diameter of 2.053 mm) carrying a 20.0-A current, given that there is one free electron per copper atom. (Household wiring often contains 12-gauge copper wire, and the maximum current allowed in such wire is usually 20 A.) The density of copper is 8.80×103kg/m38.80×103kg/m3. 8.80×103kg/m38.80×103kg/m3 We can calculate the drift velocity using the equation

Page 229,"The current that flows through most substances is directly proportional to the voltage VV applied to it. The German physicist Georg Simon Ohm (1787–1854) was the first to demonstrate experimentally that the current in a metal wire is directly proportional to the voltage applied: VV 20.12 This important relationship is known as Ohm’s law. It can be viewed as a cause-and-effect relationship, with voltage the cause and current the effect. This is an empirical law like that for friction—an experimentally observed phenomenon. Such a linear relationship doesn’t always occur. Ohm’s law"
Page 229,"If voltage drives current, what impedes it? The electric property that impedes current (crudely similar to friction and air resistance) is called resistance RR. Collisions of moving charges with atoms and molecules in a substance transfer energy to the substance and limit current. Resistance is defined as inversely proportional to current, or resistance RR 20.13 Thus, for example, current is cut in half if resistance doubles. Combining the relationships of current to voltage and current to resistance gives 20.14 This relationship is also called Ohm’s law. Ohm’s law in this form really defines resistance for certain materials. Ohm’s law (like Hooke’s law) is not universally valid. The many substances for which Ohm’s law holds are called ohmic. These include good conductors like copper and aluminum, and some poor conductors under certain circumstances. Ohmic materials have a resistance RR that is independent of voltage VV and current II. An object that has simple resistance is called a resistor, even if its resistance is small. The unit for resistance is an ohm and is given the symbol ΩΩ (upper case Greek omega). Rearranging I=V/RI=V/R gives R=V/IR=V/I, and so the units of resistance are 1 ohm = 1 volt per ampere: ohmic RR VV II ohm ΩΩ I=V/RI=V/R R=V/IR=V/I 20.15 Figure 20.8 shows the schematic for a simple circuit. A simple circuit has a single voltage source and a single resistor. The wires connecting the voltage source to the resistor can be assumed to have negligible resistance, or their resistance can be included in RR. simple circuit RR Figure 20.8 A simple electric circuit in which a closed path for current to flow is supplied by conductors (usually metal wires) connecting a load to the terminals of a battery, represented by the red parallel lines. The zigzag symbol represents the single resistor and includes any resistance in the connections to the voltage source. Example 20.4 What is the resistance of an automobile headlight through which 2.50 A flows when 12.0 V is applied to it? We can rearrange Ohm’s law as stated by I=V/RI=V/R and use it to find the resistance. I=V/RI=V/R Rearranging I=V/RI=V/R and substituting known values gives I=V/RI=V/R 20.16 This is a relatively small resistance, but it is larger than the cold resistance of the headlight. As we shall see in Resistance and Resistivity, resistance usually increases with temperature, and so the bulb has a lower resistance when it is first switched on and will draw considerably more current during its brief warm-up period. Resistances range over many orders of magnitude. Some ceramic insulators, such as those used to support power lines, have resistances of 1012Ω1012Ω or more. A dry person may have a hand-to-foot resistance of 105Ω105Ω, whereas the resistance of the human heart is about 103Ω103Ω. A meter-long piece of large-diameter copper wire may have a resistance of 10−5Ω10−5Ω, and superconductors have no resistance at all (they are non-ohmic). Resistance is related to the shape of an object and the material of which it is composed, as will be seen in Resistance and Resistivity. 1012Ω1012Ω 105Ω105Ω 103Ω103Ω 10−5Ω10−5Ω Additional insight is gained by solving I=V/RI=V/R for V,V, yielding I=V/RI=V/R V,V, 20.17 This expression for VV can be interpreted as the voltage drop across a resistor produced by the flow of current II. The phrase IRIR drop is often used for this voltage. For instance, the headlight in Example 20.4 has an IRIR drop of 12.0 V. If voltage is measured at various points in a circuit, it will be seen to increase at the voltage source and decrease at the resistor. Voltage is similar to fluid pressure. The voltage source is like a pump, creating a pressure difference, causing current—the flow of charge. The resistor is like a pipe that reduces pressure and limits flow because of its resistance. Conservation of energy has important consequences here. The voltage source supplies energy (causing an electric field and a current), and the resistor converts it to another form (such as thermal energy). In a simple circuit (one with a single simple resistor), the voltage supplied by the source equals the voltage drop across the resistor, since PE=qΔVPE=qΔV, and the same qq flows through each. Thus the energy supplied by the voltage source and the energy converted by the resistor are equal. (See Figure 20.9.) VV II IRIR IRIR PE=qΔVPE=qΔV qq Figure 20.9 The voltage drop across a resistor in a simple circuit equals the voltage output of the battery. PhET Explorations Making Connections: Conservation of Energy In a simple electrical circuit, the sole resistor converts energy supplied by the source into another form. Conservation of energy is evidenced here by the fact that all of the energy supplied by the source is converted to another form by the resistor alone. We will find that conservation of energy has other important applications in circuits and is a powerful tool in circuit analysis."

Page 230,"The resistance of an object depends on its shape and the material of which it is composed. The cylindrical resistor in Figure 20.10 is easy to analyze, and, by so doing, we can gain insight into the resistance of more complicated shapes. As you might expect, the cylinder’s electric resistance RR is directly proportional to its length LL, similar to the resistance of a pipe to fluid flow. The longer the cylinder, the more collisions charges will make with its atoms. The greater the diameter of the cylinder, the more current it can carry (again similar to the flow of fluid through a pipe). In fact, RR is inversely proportional to the cylinder’s cross-sectional area AA. RR LL RR AA Figure 20.10 A uniform cylinder of length LL and cross-sectional area AA. Its resistance to the flow of current is similar to the resistance posed by a pipe to fluid flow. The longer the cylinder, the greater its resistance. The larger its cross-sectional area AA, the smaller its resistance. For a given shape, the resistance depends on the material of which the object is composed. Different materials offer different resistance to the flow of charge. We define the resistivity ρρ of a substance so that the resistance RR of an object is directly proportional to ρρ. Resistivity ρρ is an intrinsic property of a material, independent of its shape or size. The resistance RR of a uniform cylinder of length LL, of cross-sectional area AA, and made of a material with resistivity ρρ, is resistivity ρρ RR ρρ ρρ RR LL AA ρρ 20.18 Table 20.1 gives representative values of ρρ. The materials listed in the table are separated into categories of conductors, semiconductors, and insulators, based on broad groupings of resistivities. Conductors have the smallest resistivities, and insulators have the largest; semiconductors have intermediate resistivities. Conductors have varying but large free charge densities, whereas most charges in insulators are bound to atoms and are not free to move. Semiconductors are intermediate, having far fewer free charges than conductors, but having properties that make the number of free charges depend strongly on the type and amount of impurities in the semiconductor. These unique properties of semiconductors are put to use in modern electronics, as will be explored in later chapters. ρρ Table 20.1 Resistivities

Page 230,"The resistivity of all materials depends on temperature. Some even become superconductors (zero resistivity) at very low temperatures. (See Figure 20.11.) Conversely, the resistivity of conductors increases with increasing temperature. Since the atoms vibrate more rapidly and over larger distances at higher temperatures, the electrons moving through a metal make more collisions, effectively making the resistivity higher. Over relatively small temperature changes (about 100ºC100ºC or less), resistivity ρρ varies with temperature change ΔTΔT as expressed in the following equation 100ºC100ºC ρρ ΔTΔT 20.23 where ρ0ρ0 is the original resistivity and αα is the temperature coefficient of resistivity. (See the values of αα in Table 20.2 below.) For larger temperature changes, αα may vary or a nonlinear equation may be needed to find ρρ. Note that αα is positive for metals, meaning their resistivity increases with temperature. Some alloys have been developed specifically to have a small temperature dependence. Manganin (which is made of copper, manganese and nickel), for example, has αα close to zero (to three digits on the scale in Table 20.2), and so its resistivity varies only slightly with temperature. This is useful for making a temperature-independent resistance standard, for example. ρ0ρ0 αα temperature coefficient of resistivity αα αα ρρ αα αα Figure 20.11 The resistance of a sample of mercury is zero at very low temperatures—it is a superconductor up to about 4.2 K.

   α    

  α Note also that αα is negative for the semiconductors listed in Table 20.2, meaning that their resistivity decreases with increasing temperature. They become better conductors at higher temperature, because increased thermal agitation increases the number of free charges available to carry current. This property of decreasing ρρ with temperature is also related to the type and amount of impurities present in the semiconductors. αα ρρ The resistance of an object also depends on temperature, since R0R0 is directly proportional to ρρ. For a cylinder we know R=ρL/AR=ρL/A, and so, if LL and AA do not change greatly with temperature, RR will have the same temperature dependence as ρρ. (Examination of the coefficients of linear expansion shows them to be about two orders of magnitude less than typical temperature coefficients of resistivity, and so the effect of temperature on LL and AA is about two orders of magnitude less than on ρρ.) Thus, R0R0 ρρ R=ρL/AR=ρL/A LL AA RR ρρ LL AA ρρ 20.24 is the temperature dependence of the resistance of an object, where R0R0 is the original resistance and RR is the resistance after a temperature change ΔTΔT. Numerous thermometers are based on the effect of temperature on resistance. (See Figure 20.12.) One of the most common is the thermistor, a semiconductor crystal with a strong temperature dependence, the resistance of which is measured to obtain its temperature. The device is small, so that it quickly comes into thermal equilibrium with the part of a person it touches. R0R0 RR ΔTΔT Figure 20.12 These familiar thermometers are based on the automated measurement of a thermistor’s temperature-dependent resistance.

Page 231,"Power is associated by many people with electricity. Knowing that power is the rate of energy use or energy conversion, what is the expression for electric power? Power transmission lines might come to mind. We also think of lightbulbs in terms of their power ratings in watts. Let us compare a 25-W bulb with a 60-W bulb. (See Figure 20.13(a).) Since both operate on the same voltage, the 60-W bulb must draw more current to have a greater power rating. Thus the 60-W bulb’s resistance must be lower than that of a 25-W bulb. If we increase voltage, we also increase power. For example, when a 25-W bulb that is designed to operate on 120 V is connected to 240 V, it briefly glows very brightly and then burns out. Precisely how are voltage, current, and resistance related to electric power? electric power Figure 20.13 (a) Which of these lightbulbs, the 25-W bulb (upper left) or the 60-W bulb (upper right), has the higher resistance? Which draws more current? Which uses the most energy? Can you tell from the color that the 25-W filament is cooler? Is the brighter bulb a different color and if so why? (credits: Dickbauch, Wikimedia Commons; Greg Westfall, Flickr) (b) This compact fluorescent light (CFL) puts out the same intensity of light as the 60-W bulb, but at 1/4 to 1/10 the input power. (credit: dbgg1979, Flickr) Electric energy depends on both the voltage involved and the charge moved. This is expressed most simply as PE=qVPE=qV, where qq is the charge moved and VV is the voltage (or more precisely, the potential difference the charge moves through). Power is the rate at which energy is moved, and so electric power is PE=qVPE=qV qq VV 20.26 Recognizing that current is I=q/tI=q/t (note that Δt=tΔt=t here), the expression for power becomes I=q/tI=q/t Δt=tΔt=t 20.27 Electric power (PP ) is simply the product of current times voltage. Power has familiar units of watts. Since the SI unit for potential energy (PE) is the joule, power has units of joules per second, or watts. Thus, 1 A ⋅V= 1 W1 A ⋅V= 1 W. For example, cars often have one or more auxiliary power outlets with which you can charge a cell phone or other electronic devices. These outlets may be rated at 20 A, so that the circuit can deliver a maximum power
P=IV=(20 A)(12 V)=240 WP=IV=(20 A)(12 V)=240 W. In some applications, electric power may be expressed as volt-amperes or even kilovolt-amperes (
1 kA ⋅V= 1 kW1 kA ⋅V= 1 kW). PP 1 A ⋅V= 1 W1 A ⋅V= 1 W P=IV=(20 A)(12 V)=240 WP=IV=(20 A)(12 V)=240 W 1 kA ⋅V= 1 kW1 kA ⋅V= 1 kW To see the relationship of power to resistance, we combine Ohm’s law with P=IVP=IV. Substituting I=V/RI=V/R gives P=(V/R)V=V2/RP=(V/R)V=V2/R. Similarly, substituting V=IRV=IR gives P=I(IR)=I2RP=I(IR)=I2R. Three expressions for electric power are listed together here for convenience: P=IVP=IV I=V/RI=V/R P=(V/R)V=V2/RP=(V/R)V=V2/R V=IRV=IR P=I(IR)=I2RP=I(IR)=I2R 20.28 20.29 20.30 Note that the first equation is always valid, whereas the other two can be used only for resistors. In a simple circuit, with one voltage source and a single resistor, the power supplied by the voltage source and that dissipated by the resistor are identical. (In more complicated circuits, PP can be the power dissipated by a single device and not the total power in the circuit.) PP Different insights can be gained from the three different expressions for electric power. For example, P=V2/RP=V2/R implies that the lower the resistance connected to a given voltage source, the greater the power delivered. Furthermore, since voltage is squared in P=V2/RP=V2/R, the effect of applying a higher voltage is perhaps greater than expected. Thus, when the voltage is doubled to a 25-W bulb, its power nearly quadruples to about 100 W, burning it out. If the bulb’s resistance remained constant, its power would be exactly 100 W, but at the higher temperature its resistance is higher, too. P=V2/RP=V2/R P=V2/RP=V2/R Example 20.7 (a) Consider the examples given in Ohm’s Law: Resistance and Simple Circuits and Resistance and Resistivity. Then find the power dissipated by the car headlight in these examples, both when it is hot and when it is cold. (b) What current does it draw when cold? For the hot headlight, we know voltage and current, so we can use P=IVP=IV to find the power. For the cold headlight, we know the voltage and resistance, so we can use P=V2/RP=V2/R to find the power. P=IVP=IV P=V2/RP=V2/R Entering the known values of current and voltage for the hot headlight, we obtain 20.31 The cold resistance was 0.350Ω0.350Ω, and so the power it uses when first switched on is 0.350Ω0.350Ω 20.32 The 30 W dissipated by the hot headlight is typical. But the 411 W when cold is surprisingly higher. The initial power quickly decreases as the bulb’s temperature increases and its resistance increases. The current when the bulb is cold can be found several different ways. We rearrange one of the power equations, P=I2RP=I2R, and enter known values, obtaining P=I2RP=I2R 20.33 The cold current is remarkably higher than the steady-state value of 2.50 A, but the current will quickly decline to that value as the bulb’s temperature increases. Most fuses and circuit breakers (used to limit the current in a circuit) are designed to tolerate very high currents briefly as a device comes on. In some cases, such as with electric motors, the current remains high for several seconds, necessitating special “slow blow” fuses."

Page 231,"The more electric appliances you use and the longer they are left on, the higher your electric bill. This familiar fact is based on the relationship between energy and power. You pay for the energy used. Since P=E/tP=E/t, we see that P=E/tP=E/t 20.34 is the energy used by a device using power PP for a time interval tt. For example, the more lightbulbs burning, the greater PP used; the longer they are on, the greater tt is. The energy unit on electric bills is the kilowatt-hour (kW⋅hkW⋅h), consistent with the relationship E=PtE=Pt. It is easy to estimate the cost of operating electric appliances if you have some idea of their power consumption rate in watts or kilowatts, the time they are on in hours, and the cost per kilowatt-hour for your electric utility. Kilowatt-hours, like all other specialized energy units such as food calories, can be converted to joules. You can prove to yourself that 1 kW⋅h = 3.6×106 J1 kW⋅h = 3.6×106 J. PP tt PP tt kW⋅hkW⋅h E=PtE=Pt 1 kW⋅h = 3.6×106 J1 kW⋅h = 3.6×106 J The electrical energy (EE ) used can be reduced either by reducing the time of use or by reducing the power consumption of that appliance or fixture. This will not only reduce the cost, but it will also result in a reduced impact on the environment. Improvements to lighting are some of the fastest ways to reduce the electrical energy used in a home or business. About 20% of a home’s use of energy goes to lighting, while the number for commercial establishments is closer to 40%. Fluorescent lights are about four times more efficient than incandescent lights—this is true for both the long tubes and the compact fluorescent lights (CFL). (See Figure 20.13(b).) Thus, a 60-W incandescent bulb can be replaced by a 15-W CFL, which has the same brightness and color. CFLs have a bent tube inside a globe or a spiral-shaped tube, all connected to a standard screw-in base that fits standard incandescent light sockets. (Original problems with color, flicker, shape, and high initial investment for CFLs have been addressed in recent years.) The heat transfer from these CFLs is less, and they last up to 10 times longer. The significance of an investment in such bulbs is addressed in the next example. New white LED lights (which are clusters of small LED bulbs) are even more efficient (twice that of CFLs) and last 5 times longer than CFLs. However, their cost is still high. EE Making Connections: Energy, Power, and Time The relationship E=PtE=Pt is one that you will find useful in many different contexts. The energy your body uses in exercise is related to the power level and duration of your activity, for example. The amount of heating by a power source is related to the power level and time it is applied. Even the radiation dose of an X-ray image is related to the power and time of exposure. E=PtE=Pt Example 20.8 If the cost of electricity in your area is 12 cents per kWh, what is the total cost (capital plus operation) of using a 60-W incandescent bulb for 1000 hours (the lifetime of that bulb) if the bulb cost 25 cents? (b) If we replace this bulb with a compact fluorescent light that provides the same light output, but at one-quarter the wattage, and which costs $1.50 but lasts 10 times longer (10,000 hours), what will that total cost be? To find the operating cost, we first find the energy used in kilowatt-hours and then multiply by the cost per kilowatt-hour. The energy used in kilowatt-hours is found by entering the power and time into the expression for energy: 20.35 In kilowatt-hours, this is 20.36 Now the electricity cost is 20.37 The total cost, including the cost of the bulb, will be $7.45 for 1000 hours (about one-half year at 5 hours per day). Since the CFL uses only 15 W and not 60 W, the electricity cost will be $7.20/4 = $1.80. The CFL will last 10 times longer than the incandescent, so that the investment cost will be 1/10 of the bulb cost for that time period of use, or 0.1($1.50) = $0.15. Therefore, the total cost will be $1.95 for 1000 hours. Therefore, it is much cheaper to use the CFLs, even though the initial investment is higher. The increased cost of labor that a business must include for replacing the incandescent bulbs more often has not been figured in here. Making Connections: Take-Home Experiment—Electrical Energy Use Inventory 1) Make a list of the power ratings on a range of appliances in your home or room. Explain why something like a toaster has a higher rating than a digital clock. Estimate the energy consumed by these appliances in an average day (by estimating their time of use).

Page 232,"Most of the examples dealt with so far, and particularly those utilizing batteries, have constant voltage sources. Once the current is established, it is thus also a constant. Direct current (DC) is the flow of electric charge in only one direction. It is the steady state of a constant-voltage circuit. Most well-known applications, however, use a time-varying voltage source. Alternating current (AC) is the flow of electric charge that periodically reverses direction. If the source varies periodically, particularly sinusoidally, the circuit is known as an alternating current circuit. Examples include the commercial and residential power that serves so many of our needs. Figure 20.14 shows graphs of voltage and current versus time for typical DC and AC power. The AC voltages and frequencies commonly used in homes and businesses vary around the world. Direct current Alternating current Figure 20.14 (a) DC voltage and current are constant in time, once the current is established. (b) A graph of voltage and current versus time for 60-Hz AC power. The voltage and current are sinusoidal and are in phase for a simple resistance circuit. The frequencies and peak voltages of AC sources differ greatly. Figure 20.15 The potential difference VV between the terminals of an AC voltage source fluctuates as shown. The mathematical expression for VV is given by V=V0sin 2 πftV=V0sin 2 πft. Figure 20.15 shows a schematic of a simple circuit with an AC voltage source. The voltage between the terminals fluctuates as shown, with the AC voltage given by AC voltage 20.38 where VV is the voltage at time tt, V0V0 is the peak voltage, and ff is the frequency in hertz. For this simple resistance circuit, I=V/RI=V/R, and so the AC current is VV tt V0V0 ff I=V/RI=V/R AC current 20.39 where II is the current at time tt, and I0=V0/RI0=V0/R is the peak current. For this example, the voltage and current are said to be in phase, as seen in Figure 20.14(b). II tt I0=V0/RI0=V0/R Current in the resistor alternates back and forth just like the driving voltage, since I=V/RI=V/R. If the resistor is a fluorescent light bulb, for example, it brightens and dims 120 times per second as the current repeatedly goes through zero. A 120-Hz flicker is too rapid for your eyes to detect, but if you wave your hand back and forth between your face and a fluorescent light, you will see a stroboscopic effect evidencing AC. The fact that the light output fluctuates means that the power is fluctuating. The power supplied is P=IVP=IV. Using the expressions for II and VV above, we see that the time dependence of power is P=I0V0sin2 2πftP=I0V0sin2 2πft, as shown in Figure 20.16.

Do you observe the same thing with the headlights on your car? Explain what you observe. Warning: Do not look directly at very bright light. Figure 20.16 AC power as a function of time. Since the voltage and current are in phase here, their product is non-negative and fluctuates between zero and I0V0I0V0. Average power is (1/2)I0V0(1/2)I0V0. We are most often concerned with average power rather than its fluctuations—that 60-W light bulb in your desk lamp has an average power consumption of 60 W, for example. As illustrated in Figure 20.16, the average power PavePave is PavePave 20.40 This is evident from the graph, since the areas above and below the (1/2)I0V0(1/2)I0V0 line are equal, but it can also be proven using trigonometric identities. Similarly, we define an average or rms current IrmsIrms and average or rms voltage VrmsVrms to be, respectively, (1/2)I0V0(1/2)I0V0 rms current IrmsIrms rms voltage VrmsVrms 20.41 and 20.42 where rms stands for root mean square, a particular kind of average. In general, to obtain a root mean square, the particular quantity is squared, its mean (or average) is found, and the square root is taken. This is useful for AC, since the average value is zero. Now, 20.43 which gives 20.44 as stated above. It is standard practice to quote IrmsIrms, VrmsVrms, and PavePave rather than the peak values. For example, most household electricity is 120 V AC, which means that VrmsVrms is 120 V. The common 10-A circuit breaker will interrupt a sustained IrmsIrms greater than 10 A. Your 1.0-kW microwave oven consumes Pave=1.0 kWPave=1.0 kW, and so on. You can think of these rms and average values as the equivalent DC values for a simple resistive circuit. IrmsIrms VrmsVrms PavePave VrmsVrms IrmsIrms Pave=1.0 kWPave=1.0 kW To summarize, when dealing with AC, Ohm’s law and the equations for power are completely analogous to those for DC, but rms and average values are used for AC. Thus, for AC, Ohm’s law is written 20.45 The various expressions for AC power PavePave are PavePave 20.46 20.47 and 20.48 Example 20.9 (a) What is the value of the peak voltage for 120-V AC power? (b) What is the peak power consumption rate of a 60.0-W AC light bulb? We are told that VrmsVrms is 120 V and PavePave is 60.0 W. We can use Vrms =V02Vrms =V02 to find the peak voltage, and we can manipulate the definition of power to find the peak power from the given average power. VrmsVrms PavePave Vrms =V02Vrms =V02 Solving the equation Vrms =V02Vrms =V02 for the peak voltage V0V0 and substituting the known value for VrmsVrms gives Vrms =V02Vrms =V02 V0V0 VrmsVrms 20.49 This means that the AC voltage swings from 170 V to –170 V–170 V and back 60 times every second. An equivalent DC voltage is a constant 120 V. –170 V–170 V Peak power is peak current times peak voltage. Thus, 20.50 We know the average power is 60.0 W, and so 20.51 So the power swings from zero to 120 W one hundred twenty times per second (twice each cycle), and the power averages 60 W."

Page 232,"Most large power-distribution systems are AC. Moreover, the power is transmitted at much higher voltages than the 120-V AC (240 V in most parts of the world) we use in homes and on the job. Economies of scale make it cheaper to build a few very large electric power-generation plants than to build numerous small ones. This necessitates sending power long distances, and it is obviously important that energy losses en route be minimized. High voltages can be transmitted with much smaller power losses than low voltages, as we shall see. (See Figure 20.17.) For safety reasons, the voltage at the user is reduced to familiar values. The crucial factor is that it is much easier to increase and decrease AC voltages than DC, so AC is used in most large power distribution systems. Figure 20.17 Power is distributed over large distances at high voltage to reduce power loss in the transmission lines. The voltages generated at the power plant are stepped up by passive devices called transformers (see Transformers) to 330,000 volts (or more in some places worldwide). At the point of use, the transformers reduce the voltage transmitted for safe residential and commercial use.

(b) What is the power dissipated by the transmission lines if they have a resistance of 1.00Ω1.00Ω? (c) What percentage of the power is lost in the transmission lines? 1.00Ω1.00Ω We are given Pave=100 MWPave=100 MW, Vrms=200 kVVrms=200 kV, and the resistance of the lines is R=1.00ΩR=1.00Ω. Using these givens, we can find the current flowing (from P=IVP=IV) and then the power dissipated in the lines (P=I2RP=I2R), and we take the ratio to the total power transmitted. Pave=100 MWPave=100 MW Vrms=200 kVVrms=200 kV R=1.00ΩR=1.00Ω P=IVP=IV P=I2RP=I2R To find the current, we rearrange the relationship Pave=IrmsVrmsPave=IrmsVrms and substitute known values. This gives Pave=IrmsVrmsPave=IrmsVrms 20.52 Knowing the current and given the resistance of the lines, the power dissipated in them is found from Pave=Irms2RPave=Irms2R. Substituting the known values gives Pave=Irms2RPave=Irms2R 20.53 The percent loss is the ratio of this lost power to the total or input power, multiplied by 100: 20.54 One-fourth of a percent is an acceptable loss. Note that if 100 MW of power had been transmitted at 25 kV, then a current of 4000 A would have been needed. This would result in a power loss in the lines of 16.0 MW, or 16.0% rather than 0.250%. The lower the voltage, the more current is needed, and the greater the power loss in the fixed-resistance transmission lines. Of course, lower-resistance lines can be built, but this requires larger and more expensive wires. If superconducting lines could be economically produced, there would be no loss in the transmission lines at all. But, as we shall see in a later chapter, there is a limit to current in superconductors, too. In short, high voltages are more economical for transmitting power, and AC voltage is much easier to raise and lower, so that AC is used in most large-scale power distribution systems. It is widely recognized that high voltages pose greater hazards than low voltages. But, in fact, some high voltages, such as those associated with common static electricity, can be harmless. So it is not voltage alone that determines a hazard. It is not so widely recognized that AC shocks are often more harmful than similar DC shocks. Thomas Edison thought that AC shocks were more harmful and set up a DC power-distribution system in New York City in the late 1800s. There were bitter fights, in particular between Edison and George Westinghouse and Nikola Tesla, who were advocating the use of AC in early power-distribution systems. AC has prevailed largely due to transformers and lower power losses with high-voltage transmission. PhET Explorations Generator Generate electricity with a bar magnet!

Page 233,"Electric power causes undesired heating effects whenever electric energy is converted to thermal energy at a rate faster than it can be safely dissipated. A classic example of this is the short circuit, a low-resistance path between terminals of a voltage source. An example of a short circuit is shown in Figure 20.18. Insulation on wires leading to an appliance has worn through, allowing the two wires to come into contact. Such an undesired contact with a high voltage is called a short. Since the resistance of the short, rr, is very small, the power dissipated in the short, P=V2/rP=V2/r, is very large. For example, if VV is 120 V and rr is 0.100Ω0.100Ω, then the power is 144 kW, much greater than that used by a typical household appliance. Thermal energy delivered at this rate will very quickly raise the temperature of surrounding materials, melting or perhaps igniting them. short circuit rr P=V2/rP=V2/r VV rr 0.100Ω0.100Ω Figure 20.18 A short circuit is an undesired low-resistance path across a voltage source. (a) Worn insulation on the wires of a toaster allow them to come into contact with a low resistance rr. Since P=V2/rP=V2/r, thermal power is created so rapidly that the cord melts or burns. (b) A schematic of the short circuit. One particularly insidious aspect of a short circuit is that its resistance may actually be decreased due to the increase in temperature. This can happen if the short creates ionization. These charged atoms and molecules are free to move and, thus, lower the resistance rr. Since P=V2/rP=V2/r, the power dissipated in the short rises, possibly causing more ionization, more power, and so on. High voltages, such as the 480-V AC used in some industrial applications, lend themselves to this hazard, because higher voltages create higher initial power production in a short. rr P=V2/rP=V2/r Another serious, but less dramatic, thermal hazard occurs when wires supplying power to a user are overloaded with too great a current. As discussed in the previous section, the power dissipated in the supply wires is P=I2RwP=I2Rw, where RwRw is the resistance of the wires and II the current flowing through them. If either II or RwRw is too large, the wires overheat. For example, a worn appliance cord (with some of its braided wires broken) may have Rw=2.00ΩRw=2.00Ω rather than the 0.100Ω0.100Ω it should be. If 10.0 A of current passes through the cord, then P=I2Rw=200 WP=I2Rw=200 W is dissipated in the cord—much more than is safe. Similarly, if a wire with a 0.100-Ω0.100-Ω resistance is meant to carry a few amps, but is instead carrying 100 A, it will severely overheat. The power dissipated in the wire will in that case be P=1000 WP=1000 W. Fuses and circuit breakers are used to limit excessive currents. (See Figure 20.19 and Figure 20.20.) Each device opens the circuit automatically when a sustained current exceeds safe limits. P=I2RwP=I2Rw RwRw II II RwRw Rw=2.00ΩRw=2.00Ω 0.100Ω0.100Ω P=I2Rw=200 WP=I2Rw=200 W 0.100-Ω0.100-Ω P=1000 WP=1000 W Figure 20.19 (a) A fuse has a metal strip with a low melting point that, when overheated by an excessive current, permanently breaks the connection of a circuit to a voltage source. (b) A circuit breaker is an automatic but restorable electric switch. The one shown here has a bimetallic strip that bends to the right and into the notch if overheated. The spring then forces the metal strip downward, breaking the electrical connection at the points. Figure 20.20 Schematic of a circuit with a fuse or circuit breaker in it. Fuses and circuit breakers act like automatic switches that open when sustained current exceeds desired limits. Fuses and circuit breakers for typical household voltages and currents are relatively simple to produce, but those for large voltages and currents experience special problems. For example, when a circuit breaker tries to interrupt the flow of high-voltage electricity, a spark can jump across its points that ionizes the air in the gap and allows the current to continue flowing. Large circuit breakers found in power-distribution systems employ insulating gas and even use jets of gas to blow out such sparks. Here AC is safer than DC, since AC current goes through zero 120 times per second, giving a quick opportunity to extinguish these arcs."
Page 233,"Electrical currents through people produce tremendously varied effects. An electrical current can be used to block back pain. The possibility of using electrical current to stimulate muscle action in paralyzed limbs, perhaps allowing paraplegics to walk, is under study. TV dramatizations in which electrical shocks are used to bring a heart attack victim out of ventricular fibrillation (a massively irregular, often fatal, beating of the heart) are more than common. Yet most electrical shock fatalities occur because a current put the heart into fibrillation. A pacemaker uses electrical shocks to stimulate the heart to beat properly. Some fatal shocks do not produce burns, but warts can be safely burned off with electric current (though freezing using liquid nitrogen is now more common). Of course, there are consistent explanations for these disparate effects. The major factors upon which the effects of electrical shock depend are Table 20.3 gives the effects of electrical shocks as a function of current for a typical accidental shock. The effects are for a shock that passes through the trunk of the body, has a duration of 1 s, and is caused by 60-Hz power. Figure 20.21 An electric current can cause muscular contractions with varying effects. (a) The victim is “thrown” backward by involuntary muscle contractions that extend the legs and torso. (b) The victim can’t let go of the wire that is stimulating all the muscles in the hand. Those that close the fingers are stronger than those that open them. Table 20.3 Effects of Electrical Shock as a Function of Current3 Our bodies are relatively good conductors due to the water in our bodies. Given that larger currents will flow through sections with lower resistance (to be further discussed in the next chapter), electric currents preferentially flow through paths in the human body that have a minimum resistance in a direct path to earth. The earth is a natural electron sink. Wearing insulating shoes, a requirement in many professions, prohibits a pathway for electrons by providing a large resistance in that path. Whenever working with high-power tools (drills), or in risky situations, ensure that you do not provide a pathway for current flow (especially through the heart). Very small currents pass harmlessly and unfelt through the body. This happens to you regularly without your knowledge. The threshold of sensation is only 1 mA and, although unpleasant, shocks are apparently harmless for currents less than 5 mA. A great number of safety rules take the 5-mA value for the maximum allowed shock. At 10 to 20 mA and above, the current can stimulate sustained muscular contractions much as regular nerve impulses do. People sometimes say they were knocked across the room by a shock, but what really happened was that certain muscles contracted, propelling them in a manner not of their own choosing. (See Figure 20.21(a).) More frightening, and potentially more dangerous, is the “can’t let go” effect illustrated in Figure 20.21(b). The muscles that close the fingers are stronger than those that open them, so the hand closes involuntarily on the wire shocking it. This can prolong the shock indefinitely. It can also be a danger to a person trying to rescue the victim, because the rescuer’s hand may close about the victim’s wrist. Usually the best way to help the victim is to give the fist a hard knock/blow/jar with an insulator or to throw an insulator at the fist. Modern electric fences, used in animal enclosures, are now pulsed on and off to allow people who touch them to get free, rendering them less lethal than in the past. Greater currents may affect the heart. Its electrical patterns can be disrupted, so that it beats irregularly and ineffectively in a condition called “ventricular fibrillation.” This condition often lingers after the shock and is fatal due to a lack of blood circulation. The threshold for ventricular fibrillation is between 100 and 300 mA. At about 300 mA and above, the shock can cause burns, depending on the concentration of current—the more concentrated, the greater the likelihood of burns. Very large currents cause the heart and diaphragm to contract for the duration of the shock. Both the heart and breathing stop. Interestingly, both often return to normal following the shock. The electrical patterns on the heart are completely erased in a manner that the heart can start afresh with normal beating, as opposed to the permanent disruption caused by smaller currents that can put the heart into ventricular fibrillation. The latter is something like scribbling on a blackboard, whereas the former completely erases it. TV dramatizations of electric shock used to bring a heart attack victim out of ventricular fibrillation also show large paddles. These are used to spread out current passed through the victim to reduce the likelihood of burns. Current is the major factor determining shock severity (given that other conditions such as path, duration, and frequency are fixed, such as in the table and preceding discussion). A larger voltage is more hazardous, but since I=V/RI=V/R, the severity of the shock depends on the combination of voltage and resistance. For example, a person with dry skin has a resistance of about 200 kΩ200 kΩ. If he comes into contact with 120-V AC, a current I=(120 V)/(200 k Ω) = 0.6 mA I=(120 V)/(200 k Ω) = 0.6 mA  passes harmlessly through him. The same person soaking wet may have a resistance of 10.0 kΩ10.0 kΩ and the same 120 V will produce a current of 12 mA—above the “can’t let go” threshold and potentially dangerous. I=V/RI=V/R 200 kΩ200 kΩ I=(120 V)/(200 k Ω) = 0.6 mA I=(120 V)/(200 k Ω) = 0.6 mA 10.0 kΩ10.0 kΩ Most of the body’s resistance is in its dry skin. When wet, salts go into ion form, lowering the resistance significantly. The interior of the body has a much lower resistance than dry skin because of all the ionic solutions and fluids it contains. If skin resistance is bypassed, such as by an intravenous infusion, a catheter, or exposed pacemaker leads, a person is rendered microshock sensitive. In this condition, currents about 1/1000 those listed in Table 20.3 produce similar effects. During open-heart surgery, currents as small as 20 μA20 μA can be used to still the heart. Stringent electrical safety requirements in hospitals, particularly in surgery and intensive care, are related to the doubly disadvantaged microshock-sensitive patient. The break in the skin has reduced his resistance, and so the same voltage causes a greater current, and a much smaller current has a greater effect. microshock sensitive 20 μA20 μA Figure 20.22 Graph of average values for the threshold of sensation and the “can’t let go” current as a function of frequency. The lower the value, the more sensitive the body is at that frequency. Factors other than current that affect the severity of a shock are its path, duration, and AC frequency. Path has obvious consequences. For example, the heart is unaffected by an electric shock through the brain, such as may be used to treat manic depression. And it is a general truth that the longer the duration of a shock, the greater its effects. Figure 20.22 presents a graph that illustrates the effects of frequency on a shock. The curves show the minimum current for two different effects, as a function of frequency. The lower the current needed, the more sensitive the body is at that frequency. Ironically, the body is most sensitive to frequencies near the 50- or 60-Hz frequencies in common use. The body is slightly less sensitive for DC (f=0f=0), mildly confirming Edison’s claims that AC presents a greater hazard. At higher and higher frequencies, the body becomes progressively less sensitive to any effects that involve nerves. This is related to the maximum rates at which nerves can fire or be stimulated. At very high frequencies, electrical current travels only on the surface of a person. Thus a wart can be burned off with very high frequency current without causing the heart to stop. (Do not try this at home with 60-Hz AC!) Some of the spectacular demonstrations of electricity, in which high-voltage arcs are passed through the air and over people’s bodies, employ high frequencies and low currents. (See Figure 20.23.) Electrical safety devices and techniques are discussed in detail in Electrical Safety: Systems and Devices. f=0f=0 Figure 20.23 Is this electric arc dangerous? The answer depends on the AC frequency and the power involved. (credit: Khimich Alex, Wikimedia Commons)"

Page 234,"Electric currents in the vastly complex system of billions of nerves in our body allow us to sense the world, control parts of our body, and think. These are representative of the three major functions of nerves. First, nerves carry messages from our sensory organs and others to the central nervous system, consisting of the brain and spinal cord. Second, nerves carry messages from the central nervous system to muscles and other organs. Third, nerves transmit and process signals within the central nervous system. The sheer number of nerve cells and the incredibly greater number of connections between them makes this system the subtle wonder that it is. Nerve conduction is a general term for electrical signals carried by nerve cells. It is one aspect of bioelectricity, or electrical effects in and created by biological systems. Nerve conduction bioelectricity Nerve cells, properly called neurons, look different from other cells—they have tendrils, some of them many centimeters long, connecting them with other cells. (See Figure 20.24.) Signals arrive at the cell body across synapses or through dendrites, stimulating the neuron to generate its own signal, sent along its long axon to other nerve or muscle cells. Signals may arrive from many other locations and be transmitted to yet others, conditioning the synapses by use, giving the system its complexity and its ability to learn. Figure 20.24 A neuron with its dendrites and long axon. Signals in the form of electric currents reach the cell body through dendrites and across synapses, stimulating the neuron to generate its own signal sent down the axon. The number of interconnections can be far greater than shown here. The method by which these electric currents are generated and transmitted is more complex than the simple movement of free charges in a conductor, but it can be understood with principles already discussed in this text. The most important of these are the Coulomb force and diffusion. Figure 20.25 illustrates how a voltage (potential difference) is created across the cell membrane of a neuron in its resting state. This thin membrane separates electrically neutral fluids having differing concentrations of ions, the most important varieties being Na+Na+, K+K+, and Cl-Cl- (these are sodium, potassium, and chlorine ions with single plus or minus charges as indicated). As discussed in Molecular Transport Phenomena: Diffusion, Osmosis, and Related Processes, free ions will diffuse from a region of high concentration to one of low concentration. But the cell membrane is semipermeable, meaning that some ions may cross it while others cannot. In its resting state, the cell membrane is permeable to K+K+ and Cl-Cl-, and impermeable to Na+Na+. Diffusion of K+K+ and Cl-Cl- thus creates the layers of positive and negative charge on the outside and inside of the membrane. The Coulomb force prevents the ions from diffusing across in their entirety. Once the charge layer has built up, the repulsion of like charges prevents more from moving across, and the attraction of unlike charges prevents more from leaving either side. The result is two layers of charge right on the membrane, with diffusion being balanced by the Coulomb force. A tiny fraction of the charges move across and the fluids remain neutral (other ions are present), while a separation of charge and a voltage have been created across the membrane. Na+Na+ K+K+ Cl-Cl- semipermeable K+K+ Cl-Cl- Na+Na+ K+K+ Cl-Cl- Figure 20.25 The semipermeable membrane of a cell has different concentrations of ions inside and out. Diffusion moves the K+K+ and Cl-Cl- ions in the direction shown, until the Coulomb force halts further transfer. This results in a layer of positive charge on the outside, a layer of negative charge on the inside, and thus a voltage across the cell membrane. The membrane is normally impermeable to Na+Na+. Figure 20.26 An action potential is the pulse of voltage inside a nerve cell graphed here. It is caused by movements of ions across the cell membrane as shown. Depolarization occurs when a stimulus makes the membrane permeable to Na+Na+ ions. Repolarization follows as the membrane again becomes impermeable to Na+,Na+, and K+K+ moves from high to low concentration. In the long term, active transport slowly maintains the concentration differences, but the cell may fire hundreds of times in rapid succession without seriously depleting them. The separation of charge creates a potential difference of 70 to 90 mV across the cell membrane. While this is a small voltage, the resulting electric field (E=V/dE=V/d) across the only 8-nm-thick membrane is immense (on the order of 11 MV/m!) and has fundamental effects on its structure and permeability. Now, if the exterior of a neuron is taken to be at 0 V, then the interior has a resting potential of about –90 mV. Such voltages are created across the membranes of almost all types of animal cells but are largest in nerve and muscle cells. In fact, fully 25% of the energy used by cells goes toward creating and maintaining these potentials. E=V/dE=V/d Electric currents along the cell membrane are created by any stimulus that changes the membrane’s permeability. The membrane thus temporarily becomes permeable to Na+Na+, which then rushes in, driven both by diffusion and the Coulomb force. This inrush of Na+Na+ first neutralizes the inside membrane, or depolarizes it, and then makes it slightly positive. The depolarization causes the membrane to again become impermeable to Na+Na+, and the movement of K+K+ quickly returns the cell to its resting potential, or repolarizes it. This sequence of events results in a voltage pulse, called the action potential. (See Figure 20.26.) Only small fractions of the ions move, so that the cell can fire many hundreds of times without depleting the excess concentrations of Na+Na+ and K+K+. Eventually, the cell must replenish these ions to maintain the concentration differences that create bioelectricity. This sodium-potassium pump is an example of active transport, wherein cell energy is used to move ions across membranes against diffusion gradients and the Coulomb force. Na+Na+ Na+Na+ Na+Na+ K+K+ Na+Na+ K+K+ The action potential is a voltage pulse at one location on a cell membrane. How does it get transmitted along the cell membrane, and in particular down an axon, as a nerve impulse? The answer is that the changing voltage and electric fields affect the permeability of the adjacent cell membrane, so that the same process takes place there. The adjacent membrane depolarizes, affecting the membrane further down, and so on, as illustrated in Figure 20.27. Thus the action potential stimulated at one location triggers a nerve impulse that moves slowly (about 1 m/s) along the cell membrane. Figure 20.27 A nerve impulse is the propagation of an action potential along a cell membrane. A stimulus causes an action potential at one location, which changes the permeability of the adjacent membrane, causing an action potential there. This in turn affects the membrane further down, so that the action potential moves slowly (in electrical terms) along the cell membrane. Although the impulse is due to Na+Na+ and K+K+ going across the membrane, it is equivalent to a wave of charge moving along the outside and inside of the membrane. Some axons, like that in Figure 20.24, are sheathed with myelin, consisting of fat-containing cells. Figure 20.28 shows an enlarged view of an axon having myelin sheaths characteristically separated by unmyelinated gaps (called nodes of Ranvier). This arrangement gives the axon a number of interesting properties. Since myelin is an insulator, it prevents signals from jumping between adjacent nerves (cross talk). Additionally, the myelinated regions transmit electrical signals at a very high speed, as an ordinary conductor or resistor would. There is no action potential in the myelinated regions, so that no cell energy is used in them. There is an IRIR signal loss in the myelin, but the signal is regenerated in the gaps, where the voltage pulse triggers the action potential at full voltage. So a myelinated axon transmits a nerve impulse faster, with less energy consumption, and is better protected from cross talk than an unmyelinated one. Not all axons are myelinated, so that cross talk and slow signal transmission are a characteristic of the normal operation of these axons, another variable in the nervous system. IRIR The degeneration or destruction of the myelin sheaths that surround the nerve fibers impairs signal transmission and can lead to numerous neurological effects. One of the most prominent of these diseases comes from the body’s own immune system attacking the myelin in the central nervous system—multiple sclerosis. MS symptoms include fatigue, vision problems, weakness of arms and legs, loss of balance, and tingling or numbness in one’s extremities (neuropathy). It is more apt to strike younger adults, especially females. Causes might come from infection, environmental or geographic affects, or genetics. At the moment there is no known cure for MS. Most animal cells can fire or create their own action potential. Muscle cells contract when they fire and are often induced to do so by a nerve impulse. In fact, nerve and muscle cells are physiologically similar, and there are even hybrid cells, such as in the heart, that have characteristics of both nerves and muscles. Some animals, like the infamous electric eel (see Figure 20.29), use muscles ganged so that their voltages add in order to create a shock great enough to stun prey. Figure 20.28 Propagation of a nerve impulse down a myelinated axon, from left to right. The signal travels very fast and without energy input in the myelinated regions, but it loses voltage. It is regenerated in the gaps. The signal moves faster than in unmyelinated axons and is insulated from signals in other nerves, limiting cross talk. Figure 20.29 An electric eel flexes its muscles to create a voltage that stuns prey. (credit: chrisbb, Flickr)"
Page 234,"Just as nerve impulses are transmitted by depolarization and repolarization of adjacent membrane, the depolarization that causes muscle contraction can also stimulate adjacent muscle cells to depolarize (fire) and contract. Thus, a depolarization wave can be sent across the heart, coordinating its rhythmic contractions and enabling it to perform its vital function of propelling blood through the circulatory system. Figure 20.30 is a simplified graphic of a depolarization wave spreading across the heart from the sinoarterial (SA) node, the heart’s natural pacemaker. Figure 20.30 The outer surface of the heart changes from positive to negative during depolarization. This wave of depolarization is spreading from the top of the heart and is represented by a vector pointing in the direction of the wave. This vector is a voltage (potential difference) vector. Three electrodes, labeled RA, LA, and LL, are placed on the patient. Each pair (called leads I, II, and III) measures a component of the depolarization vector and is graphed in an ECG. An electrocardiogram (ECG) is a record of the voltages created by the wave of depolarization and subsequent repolarization in the heart. (They are also abbreviated EKG.) Voltages between pairs of electrodes placed on the chest are vector components of the voltage wave on the heart. Standard ECGs have 12 or more electrodes, but only three are shown in Figure 20.30 for clarity. Decades ago, three-electrode ECGs were performed by placing electrodes on the left and right arms and the left leg. The voltage between the right arm and the left leg is called the lead II potential and is the most often graphed. We shall examine the lead II potential as an indicator of heart-muscle function and see that it is coordinated with arterial blood pressure as well. electrocardiogram (ECG) Heart function and its four-chamber action are explored in Viscosity and Laminar Flow; Poiseuille’s Law. Basically, the right and left atria receive blood from the body and lungs, respectively, and pump the blood into the ventricles. The right and left ventricles, in turn, pump blood through the lungs and the rest of the body, respectively. Depolarization of the heart muscle causes it to contract. After contraction it is repolarized to ready it for the next beat. The ECG measures components of depolarization and repolarization of the heart muscle and can yield significant information on the functioning and malfunctioning of the heart. Figure 20.31 shows an ECG of the lead II potential and a graph of the corresponding arterial blood pressure. The major features are labeled P, Q, R, S, and T. The P wave is generated by the depolarization and contraction of the atria as they pump blood into the ventricles. The QRS complex is created by the depolarization of the ventricles as they pump blood to the lungs and body. Since the shape of the heart and the path of the depolarization wave are not simple, the QRS complex has this typical shape and time span. The lead II QRS signal also masks the repolarization of the atria, which occur at the same time. Finally, the T wave is generated by the repolarization of the ventricles and is followed by the next P wave in the next heartbeat. Arterial blood pressure varies with each part of the heartbeat, with systolic (maximum) pressure occurring closely after the QRS complex, which signals contraction of the ventricles. Figure 20.31 A lead II ECG with corresponding arterial blood pressure. The QRS complex is created by the depolarization and contraction of the ventricles and is followed shortly by the maximum or systolic blood pressure. See text for further description. Taken together, the 12 leads of a state-of-the-art ECG can yield a wealth of information about the heart. For example, regions of damaged heart tissue, called infarcts, reflect electrical waves and are apparent in one or more lead potentials. Subtle changes due to slight or gradual damage to the heart are most readily detected by comparing a recent ECG to an older one. This is particularly the case since individual heart shape, size, and orientation can cause variations in ECGs from one individual to another. ECG technology has advanced to the point where a portable ECG monitor can be incorporated into wearable devices and other small objects. See Figure 20.32. Figure 20.32 In a 12-lead ECG, six electrodes are placed on the chest, and four electrodes are placed on the limbs."

Page 240,"When are resistors in series? Resistors are in series whenever the flow of charge, called the current, must flow through devices sequentially. For example, if current flows through a person holding a screwdriver and into the Earth, then R1R1 in Figure 21.2(a) could be the resistance of the screwdriver’s shaft, R2R2 the resistance of its handle, R3R3 the person’s body resistance, and R4R4 the resistance of her shoes. series current R1R1 R2R2 R3R3 R4R4 Figure 21.3 shows resistors in series connected to a voltage source. It seems reasonable that the total resistance is the sum of the individual resistances, considering that the current has to pass through each resistor in sequence. (This fact would be an advantage to a person wishing to avoid an electrical shock, who could reduce the current by wearing high-resistance rubber-soled shoes. It could be a disadvantage if one of the resistances were a faulty high-resistance cord to an appliance that would reduce the operating current.) voltage Figure 21.3 Three resistors connected in series to a battery (left) and the equivalent single or series resistance (right). To verify that resistances in series do indeed add, let us consider the loss of electrical power, called a voltage drop, in each resistor in Figure 21.3. voltage drop According to Ohm’s law, the voltage drop, VV, across a resistor when a current flows through it is calculated using the equation V=IRV=IR, where II equals the current in amps (A) and RR is the resistance in ohms ΩΩ. Another way to think of this is that VV is the voltage necessary to make a current II flow through a resistance RR. Ohm’s law VV V=IRV=IR II RR ΩΩ VV II RR So the voltage drop across R1R1 is V1=IR1V1=IR1, that across R2R2 is V2=IR2V2=IR2, and that across R3R3 is V3=IR3V3=IR3. The sum of these voltages equals the voltage output of the source; that is, R1R1 V1=IR1V1=IR1 R2R2 V2=IR2V2=IR2 R3R3 V3=IR3V3=IR3 21.1 This equation is based on the conservation of energy and conservation of charge. Electrical potential energy can be described by the equation PE=qVPE=qV, where qq is the electric charge and VV is the voltage. Thus the energy supplied by the source is qVqV, while that dissipated by the resistors is PE=qVPE=qV qq VV qVqV 21.2 Connections: Conservation Laws The derivations of the expressions for series and parallel resistance are based on the laws of conservation of energy and conservation of charge, which state that total charge and total energy are constant in any process. These two laws are directly involved in all electrical phenomena and will be invoked repeatedly to explain both specific effects and the general behavior of electricity. These energies must be equal, because there is no other source and no other destination for energy in the circuit. Thus, qV=qV1+qV2+qV3qV=qV1+qV2+qV3. The charge qq cancels, yielding V=V1+V2+V3V=V1+V2+V3, as stated. (Note that the same amount of charge passes through the battery and each resistor in a given amount of time, since there is no capacitance to store charge, there is no place for charge to leak, and charge is conserved.) qV=qV1+qV2+qV3qV=qV1+qV2+qV3 qq V=V1+V2+V3V=V1+V2+V3 Now substituting the values for the individual voltages gives 21.3 Note that for the equivalent single series resistance RsRs, we have RsRs 21.4 This implies that the total or equivalent series resistance RsRs of three resistors is Rs=R1+R2+R3Rs=R1+R2+R3. RsRs Rs=R1+R2+R3Rs=R1+R2+R3 This logic is valid in general for any number of resistors in series; thus, the total resistance RsRs of a series connection is RsRs 21.5 as proposed. Since all of the current must pass through each resistor, it experiences the resistance of each, and resistances in series simply add up. Example 21.1 Suppose the voltage output of the battery in Figure 21.3 is 12.0V12.0V, and the resistances are R1=1.00ΩR1=1.00Ω, R2=6.00ΩR2=6.00Ω, and R3=13.0ΩR3=13.0Ω. (a) What is the total resistance? (b) Find the current. (c) Calculate the voltage drop in each resistor, and show these add to equal the voltage output of the source. (d) Calculate the power dissipated by each resistor. (e) Find the power output of the source, and show that it equals the total power dissipated by the resistors. 12.0V12.0V R1=1.00ΩR1=1.00Ω R2=6.00ΩR2=6.00Ω R3=13.0ΩR3=13.0Ω The total resistance is simply the sum of the individual resistances, as given by this equation: 21.6 The current is found using Ohm’s law, V=IRV=IR. Entering the value of the applied voltage and the total resistance yields the current for the circuit: V=IRV=IR 21.7 The voltage—or IRIR drop—in a resistor is given by Ohm’s law. Entering the current and the value of the first resistance yields IRIR 21.8 Similarly, 21.9 and 21.10 The three IRIR drops add to 12.0V12.0V, as predicted: IRIR 12.0V12.0V 21.11 The easiest way to calculate power in watts (W) dissipated by a resistor in a DC circuit is to use Joule’s law, P=IVP=IV, where PP is electric power. In this case, each resistor has the same full current flowing through it. By substituting Ohm’s law V=IRV=IR into Joule’s law, we get the power dissipated by the first resistor as Joule’s law P=IVP=IV PP V=IRV=IR 21.12 Similarly, 21.13 and 21.14 Power can also be calculated using either P=IVP=IV or P=V2RP=V2R, where VV is the voltage drop across the resistor (not the full voltage of the source). The same values will be obtained. P=IVP=IV P=V2RP=V2R VV The easiest way to calculate power output of the source is to use P=IVP=IV, where VV is the source voltage. This gives P=IVP=IV VV 21.15 Note, coincidentally, that the total power dissipated by the resistors is also 7.20 W, the same as the power put out by the source. That is, 21.16 Power is energy per unit time (watts), and so conservation of energy requires the power output of the source to be equal to the total power dissipated by the resistors.

Page 240,"Figure 21.4 shows resistors in parallel, wired to a voltage source. Resistors are in parallel when each resistor is connected directly to the voltage source by connecting wires having negligible resistance. Each resistor thus has the full voltage of the source applied to it. parallel Each resistor draws the same current it would if it alone were connected to the voltage source (provided the voltage source is not overloaded). For example, an automobile’s headlights, radio, and so on, are wired in parallel, so that they utilize the full voltage of the source and can operate completely independently. The same is true in your house, or any building. (See Figure 21.4(b).) Figure 21.4 (a) Three resistors connected in parallel to a battery and the equivalent single or parallel resistance. (b) Electrical power setup in a house. (credit: Dmitry G, Wikimedia Commons) To find an expression for the equivalent parallel resistance RpRp, let us consider the currents that flow and how they are related to resistance. Since each resistor in the circuit has the full voltage, the currents flowing through the individual resistors are I1=VR1I1=VR1, I2=VR2I2=VR2, and I3=VR3I3=VR3. Conservation of charge implies that the total current II produced by the source is the sum of these currents: RpRp I1=VR1I1=VR1 I2=VR2I2=VR2 I3=VR3I3=VR3 II 21.17 Substituting the expressions for the individual currents gives 21.18 Note that Ohm’s law for the equivalent single resistance gives 21.19 The terms inside the parentheses in the last two equations must be equal. Generalizing to any number of resistors, the total resistance RpRp of a parallel connection is related to the individual resistances by RpRp 21.20 This relationship results in a total resistance RpRp that is less than the smallest of the individual resistances. (This is seen in the next example.) When resistors are connected in parallel, more current flows from the source than would flow for any of them individually, and so the total resistance is lower. RpRp Example 21.2 Let the voltage output of the battery and resistances in the parallel connection in Figure 21.4 be the same as the previously considered series connection: V=12.0 VV=12.0 V, R1=1.00ΩR1=1.00Ω, R2=6.00ΩR2=6.00Ω, and R3=13.0ΩR3=13.0Ω. (a) What is the total resistance? (b) Find the total current. (c) Calculate the currents in each resistor, and show these add to equal the total current output of the source. (d) Calculate the power dissipated by each resistor. (e) Find the power output of the source, and show that it equals the total power dissipated by the resistors. V=12.0 VV=12.0 V R1=1.00ΩR1=1.00Ω R2=6.00ΩR2=6.00Ω R3=13.0ΩR3=13.0Ω The total resistance for a parallel combination of resistors is found using the equation below. Entering known values gives 21.21 Thus, 21.22 (Note that in these calculations, each intermediate answer is shown with an extra digit.) We must invert this to find the total resistance RpRp. This yields RpRp 21.23 The total resistance with the correct number of significant digits is

. RpRp is, as predicted, less than the smallest individual resistance. RpRp The total current can be found from Ohm’s law, substituting RpRp for the total resistance. This gives RpRp 21.24 Current II for each device is much larger than for the same devices connected in series (see the previous example). A circuit with parallel connections has a smaller total resistance than the resistors connected in series. II The individual currents are easily calculated from Ohm’s law, since each resistor gets the full voltage. Thus, 21.25 Similarly, 21.26 and 21.27 The total current is the sum of the individual currents: 21.28 This is consistent with conservation of charge. The power dissipated by each resistor can be found using any of the equations relating power to current, voltage, and resistance, since all three are known. Let us use P=V2RP=V2R, since each resistor gets full voltage. Thus, P=V2RP=V2R 21.29 Similarly, 21.30 and 21.31 The power dissipated by each resistor is considerably higher in parallel than when connected in series to the same voltage source. The total power can also be calculated in several ways. Choosing P=IVP=IV, and entering the total current, yields P=IVP=IV 21.32 Total power dissipated by the resistors is also 179 W: 21.33 This is consistent with the law of conservation of energy. Note that both the currents and powers in parallel connections are greater than for the same devices in series. Major Features of Resistors in Parallel"
Page 240,"More complex connections of resistors are sometimes just combinations of series and parallel. These are commonly encountered, especially when wire resistance is considered. In that case, wire resistance is in series with other resistances that are in parallel. Combinations of series and parallel can be reduced to a single equivalent resistance using the technique illustrated in Figure 21.5. Various parts are identified as either series or parallel, reduced to their equivalents, and further reduced until a single resistance is left. The process is more time consuming than difficult. Figure 21.5 This combination of seven resistors has both series and parallel parts. Each is identified and reduced to an equivalent resistance, and these are further reduced until a single equivalent resistance is reached. The simplest combination of series and parallel resistance, shown in Figure 21.6, is also the most instructive, since it is found in many applications. For example, R1R1 could be the resistance of wires from a car battery to its electrical devices, which are in parallel. R2R2 and R3R3 could be the starter motor and a passenger compartment light. We have previously assumed that wire resistance is negligible, but, when it is not, it has important effects, as the next example indicates. R1R1 R2R2 R3R3 Example 21.3 Figure 21.6 shows the resistors from the previous two examples wired in a different way—a combination of series and parallel. We can consider R1R1 to be the resistance of wires leading to R2R2 and R3R3. (a) Find the total resistance. (b) What is the IRIR drop in R1R1? (c) Find the current I2I2 through R2R2. (d) What power is dissipated by R2R2? R1R1 R2R2 R3R3 IRIR R1R1 I2I2 R2R2 R2R2 Figure 21.6 These three resistors are connected to a voltage source so that R2R2 and R3R3 are in parallel with one another and that combination is in series with R1R1. To find the total resistance, we note that R2R2 and R3R3 are in parallel and their combination RpRp is in series with R1R1. Thus the total (equivalent) resistance of this combination is R2R2 R3R3 RpRp R1R1 21.34 First, we find RpRp using the equation for resistors in parallel and entering known values: RpRp 21.35 Inverting gives 21.36 So the total resistance is 21.37 The total resistance of this combination is intermediate between the pure series and pure parallel values (20.0 Ω20.0 Ω and 0.804 Ω0.804 Ω, respectively) found for the same resistors in the two previous examples. 20.0 Ω20.0 Ω 0.804 Ω0.804 Ω To find the IRIR drop in R1R1, we note that the full current II flows through R1R1. Thus its IRIR drop is IRIR R1R1 II R1R1 IRIR 21.38 We must find II before we can calculate V1V1. The total current II is found using Ohm’s law for the circuit. That is, II V1V1 II 21.39 Entering this into the expression above, we get 21.40 The voltage applied to R2R2 and R3R3 is less than the total voltage by an amount V1V1. When wire resistance is large, it can significantly affect the operation of the devices represented by R2R2 and R3R3. R2R2 R3R3 V1V1 R2R2 R3R3 To find the current through R2R2, we must first find the voltage applied to it. We call this voltage VpVp, because it is applied to a parallel combination of resistors. The voltage applied to both R2R2 and R3R3 is reduced by the amount V1V1, and so it is R2R2 VpVp R2R2 R3R3 V1V1 21.41 Now the current I2I2 through resistance R2R2 is found using Ohm’s law: I2I2 R2R2 21.42 The current is less than the 2.00 A that flowed through R2R2 when it was connected in parallel to the battery in the previous parallel circuit example. R2R2 The power dissipated by R2R2 is given by R2R2 21.43 The power is less than the 24.0 W this resistor dissipated when connected in parallel to the 12.0-V source."
Page 240,"One implication of this last example is that resistance in wires reduces the current and power delivered to a resistor. If wire resistance is relatively large, as in a worn (or a very long) extension cord, then this loss can be significant. If a large current is drawn, the IRIR drop in the wires can also be significant. IRIR For example, when you are rummaging in the refrigerator and the motor comes on, the refrigerator light dims momentarily. Similarly, you can see the passenger compartment light dim when you start the engine of your car (although this may be due to resistance inside the battery itself). What is happening in these high-current situations is illustrated in Figure 21.7. The device represented by R3R3 has a very low resistance, and so when it is switched on, a large current flows. This increased current causes a larger IRIR drop in the wires represented by R1R1, reducing the voltage across the light bulb (which is R2R2), which then dims noticeably. R3R3 IRIR R1R1 R2R2 Figure 21.7 Why do lights dim when a large appliance is switched on? The answer is that the large current the appliance motor draws causes a significant IRIR drop in the wires and reduces the voltage across the light."

Page 241,"You can think of many different types of voltage sources. Batteries themselves come in many varieties. There are many types of mechanical/electrical generators, driven by many different energy sources, ranging from nuclear to wind. Solar cells create voltages directly from light, while thermoelectric devices create voltage from temperature differences. A few voltage sources are shown in Figure 21.8. All such devices create a potential difference and can supply current if connected to a resistance. On the small scale, the potential difference creates an electric field that exerts force on charges, causing current. We thus use the name electromotive force, abbreviated emf. potential difference electromotive force Emf is not a force at all; it is a special type of potential difference. To be precise, the electromotive force (emf) is the potential difference of a source when no current is flowing. Units of emf are volts. Figure 21.8 A variety of voltage sources (clockwise from top left): the Brazos Wind Farm in Fluvanna, Texas (credit: Leaflet, Wikimedia Commons); the Krasnoyarsk Dam in Russia (credit: Alex Polezhaev); a solar farm (credit: U.S. Department of Energy); and a group of nickel metal hydride batteries (credit: Tiaa Monto). The voltage output of each depends on its construction and load, and equals emf only if there is no load. Electromotive force is directly related to the source of potential difference, such as the particular combination of chemicals in a battery. However, emf differs from the voltage output of the device when current flows. The voltage across the terminals of a battery, for example, is less than the emf when the battery supplies current, and it declines further as the battery is depleted or loaded down. However, if the device’s output voltage can be measured without drawing current, then output voltage will equal emf (even for a very depleted battery)."
Page 241,"As noted before, a 12-V truck battery is physically larger, contains more charge and energy, and can deliver a larger current than a 12-V motorcycle battery. Both are lead-acid batteries with identical emf, but, because of its size, the truck battery has a smaller internal resistance rr. Internal resistance is the inherent resistance to the flow of current within the source itself. rr Figure 21.9 is a schematic representation of the two fundamental parts of any voltage source. The emf (represented by a script E in the figure) and internal resistance rr are in series. The smaller the internal resistance for a given emf, the more current and the more power the source can supply. rr Figure 21.9 Any voltage source (in this case, a carbon-zinc dry cell) has an emf related to its source of potential difference, and an internal resistance rr related to its construction. (Note that the script E stands for emf.). Also shown are the output terminals across which the terminal voltage  VV is measured. Since V=emf−IrV=emf−Ir, terminal voltage equals emf only if there is no current flowing. The internal resistance rr can behave in complex ways. As noted, rr increases as a battery is depleted. But internal resistance may also depend on the magnitude and direction of the current through a voltage source, its temperature, and even its history. The internal resistance of rechargeable nickel-cadmium cells, for example, depends on how many times and how deeply they have been depleted. rr rr Things Great and Small: The Submicroscopic Origin of Battery Potential Various types of batteries are available, with emfs determined by the combination of chemicals involved. We can view this as a molecular reaction (what much of chemistry is about) that separates charge. The lead-acid battery used in cars and other vehicles is one of the most common types. A single cell (one of six) of this battery is seen in Figure 21.10. The cathode (positive) terminal of the cell is connected to a lead oxide plate, while the anode (negative) terminal is connected to a lead plate. Both plates are immersed in sulfuric acid, the electrolyte for the system. Figure 21.10 Artist’s conception of a lead-acid cell. Chemical reactions in a lead-acid cell separate charge, sending negative charge to the anode, which is connected to the lead plates. The lead oxide plates are connected to the positive or cathode terminal of the cell. Sulfuric acid conducts the charge as well as participating in the chemical reaction. The details of the chemical reaction are left to the reader to pursue in a chemistry text, but their results at the molecular level help explain the potential created by the battery. Figure 21.11 shows the result of a single chemical reaction. Two electrons are placed on the anode, making it negative, provided that the cathode supplied two electrons. This leaves the cathode positively charged, because it has lost two electrons. In short, a separation of charge has been driven by a chemical reaction. Note that the reaction will not take place unless there is a complete circuit to allow two electrons to be supplied to the cathode. Under many circumstances, these electrons come from the anode, flow through a resistance, and return to the cathode. Note also that since the chemical reactions involve substances with resistance, it is not possible to create the emf without an internal resistance. Figure 21.11 Artist’s conception of two electrons being forced onto the anode of a cell and two electrons being removed from the cathode of the cell. The chemical reaction in a lead-acid battery places two electrons on the anode and removes two from the cathode. It requires a closed circuit to proceed, since the two electrons must be supplied to the cathode. Why are the chemicals able to produce a unique potential difference? Quantum mechanical descriptions of molecules, which take into account the types of atoms and numbers of electrons in them, are able to predict the energy states they can have and the energies of reactions between them. In the case of a lead-acid battery, an energy of 2 eV is given to each electron sent to the anode. Voltage is defined as the electrical potential energy divided by charge: V=PEqV=PEq. An electron volt is the energy given to a single electron by a voltage of 1 V. So the voltage here is 2 V, since 2 eV is given to each electron. It is the energy produced in each molecular reaction that produces the voltage. A different reaction produces a different energy and, hence, a different voltage. V=PEqV=PEq"

Page 241,"The voltage output of a device is measured across its terminals and, thus, is called its terminal voltageVV. Terminal voltage is given by terminal voltage VV 21.44 where rr is the internal resistance and II is the current flowing at the time of the measurement. rr II II is positive if current flows away from the positive terminal, as shown in Figure 21.9. You can see that the larger the current, the smaller the terminal voltage. And it is likewise true that the larger the internal resistance, the smaller the terminal voltage. II Suppose a load resistance RloadRload is connected to a voltage source, as in Figure 21.12. Since the resistances are in series, the total resistance in the circuit is Rload+rRload+r. Thus the current is given by Ohm’s law to be RloadRload Rload+rRload+r 21.45 Figure 21.12 Schematic of a voltage source and its load RloadRload. Since the internal resistance rr is in series with the load, it can significantly affect the terminal voltage and current delivered to the load.  (Note that the script E stands for emf.) We see from this expression that the smaller the internal resistance rr, the greater the current the voltage source supplies to its load RloadRload. As batteries are depleted, rr increases. If rr becomes a significant fraction of the load resistance, then the current is significantly reduced, as the following example illustrates. rr RloadRload rr rr Example 21.4 A certain battery has a 12.0-V emf and an internal resistance of 0.100Ω0.100Ω.

(c) What power does the 0.500-Ω0.500-Ω load dissipate? (d) If the internal resistance grows to 0.500 Ω0.500 Ω, find the current, terminal voltage, and power dissipated by a 0.500-Ω0.500-Ω load. 0.100Ω0.100Ω 10.0-Ω10.0-Ω 0.500-Ω0.500-Ω 0.500-Ω0.500-Ω 0.500 Ω0.500 Ω 0.500-Ω0.500-Ω The analysis above gave an expression for current when internal resistance is taken into account. Once the current is found, the terminal voltage can be calculated using the equation V=emf−IrV=emf−Ir. Once current is found, the power dissipated by a resistor can also be found. V=emf−IrV=emf−Ir Entering the given values for the emf, load resistance, and internal resistance into the expression above yields 21.46 Enter the known values into the equation V=emf−IrV=emf−Ir to get the terminal voltage: V=emf−IrV=emf−Ir 21.47 The terminal voltage here is only slightly lower than the emf, implying that 10.0Ω10.0Ω is a light load for this particular battery. 10.0Ω10.0Ω Similarly, with Rload=0.500ΩRload=0.500Ω, the current is Rload=0.500ΩRload=0.500Ω 21.48 The terminal voltage is now 21.49 This terminal voltage exhibits a more significant reduction compared with emf, implying 0.500 Ω0.500 Ω is a heavy load for this battery. 0.500 Ω0.500 Ω The power dissipated by the 0.500 - Ω0.500 - Ω load can be found using the formula P=I2RP=I2R.

V2RV2R IVIV VV Here the internal resistance has increased, perhaps due to the depletion of the battery, to the point where it is as great as the load resistance. As before, we first find the current by entering the known values into the expression, yielding 21.51 Now the terminal voltage is 21.52 and the power dissipated by the load is 21.53 We see that the increased internal resistance has significantly decreased terminal voltage, current, and power delivered to a load. Battery testers, such as those in Figure 21.13, use small load resistors to intentionally draw current to determine whether the terminal voltage drops below an acceptable level. They really test the internal resistance of the battery. If internal resistance is high, the battery is weak, as evidenced by its low terminal voltage. Figure 21.13 These two battery testers measure terminal voltage under a load to determine the condition of a battery. The large device is being used by a U.S. Navy electronics technician to test large batteries aboard the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz and has a small resistance that can dissipate large amounts of power.

Johnston) The small device is used on small batteries and has a digital display to indicate the acceptability of their terminal voltage. (credit: Keith Williamson) Some batteries can be recharged by passing a current through them in the direction opposite to the current they supply to a resistance. This is done routinely in cars and batteries for small electrical appliances and electronic devices, and is represented pictorially in Figure 21.14. The voltage output of the battery charger must be greater than the emf of the battery to reverse current through it. This will cause the terminal voltage of the battery to be greater than the emf, since V=emf−IrV=emf−Ir, and II is now negative. V=emf−IrV=emf−Ir II Figure 21.14 A car battery charger reverses the normal direction of current through a battery, reversing its chemical reaction and replenishing its chemical potential."
Page 241,"There are two voltage sources when a battery charger is used. Voltage sources connected in series are relatively simple. When voltage sources are in series, their internal resistances add and their emfs add algebraically. (See Figure 21.15.) Series connections of voltage sources are common—for example, in flashlights, toys, and other appliances. Usually, the cells are in series in order to produce a larger total emf. But if the cells oppose one another, such as when one is put into an appliance backward, the total emf is less, since it is the algebraic sum of the individual emfs. A battery is a multiple connection of voltaic cells, as shown in Figure 21.16. The disadvantage of series connections of cells is that their internal resistances add. One of the authors once owned a 1957 MGA that had two 6-V batteries in series, rather than a single 12-V battery. This arrangement produced a large internal resistance that caused him many problems in starting the engine. Figure 21.15 A series connection of two voltage sources. The emfs (each labeled with a script E) and internal resistances add, giving a total emf of emf1+emf2emf1+emf2 and a total internal resistance of r1+r2r1+r2. Figure 21.16 Batteries are multiple connections of individual cells, as shown in this modern rendition of an old print. Single cells, such as AA or C cells, are commonly called batteries, although this is technically incorrect. If the series connection of two voltage sources is made into a complete circuit with the emfs in opposition, then a current of magnitude I=emf1–emf2r1+r2I=emf1–emf2r1+r2 flows. See Figure 21.17, for example, which shows a circuit exactly analogous to the battery charger discussed above. If two voltage sources in series with emfs in the same sense are connected to a load RloadRload, as in Figure 21.18, then

I=emf1+emf2r1+r2+RloadI=emf1+emf2r1+r2+Rload flows. I=emf1–emf2r1+r2I=emf1–emf2r1+r2 RloadRload I=emf1+emf2r1+r2+RloadI=emf1+emf2r1+r2+Rload Figure 21.17 These two voltage sources are connected in series with their emfs in opposition. Current flows in the direction of the greater emf and is limited to I=emf1−emf2r1+r2I=emf1−emf2r1+r2 by the sum of the internal resistances. (Note that each emf is represented by script E in the figure.) A battery charger connected to a battery is an example of such a connection. The charger must have a larger emf than the battery to reverse current through it. Figure 21.18 This schematic represents a flashlight with two cells (voltage sources) and a single bulb (load resistance) in series. The current that flows is I=emf1+emf2r1+r2+RloadI=emf1+emf2r1+r2+Rload. (Note that each emf is represented by script E in the figure.) Take-Home Experiment: Flashlight Batteries Find a flashlight that uses several batteries and find new and old batteries. Based on the discussions in this module, predict the brightness of the flashlight when different combinations of batteries are used. Do your predictions match what you observe? Now place new batteries in the flashlight and leave the flashlight switched on for several hours. Is the flashlight still quite bright? Do the same with the old batteries. Is the flashlight as bright when left on for the same length of time with old and new batteries? What does this say for the case when you are limited in the number of available new batteries? Figure 21.19 shows two voltage sources with identical emfs in parallel and connected to a load resistance. In this simple case, the total emf is the same as the individual emfs. But the total internal resistance is reduced, since the internal resistances are in parallel. The parallel connection thus can produce a larger current. Here, I=emfrtot+RloadI=emfrtot+Rload flows through the load, and rtotrtot is less than those of the individual batteries. For example, some diesel-powered cars use two 12-V batteries in parallel; they produce a total emf of 12 V but can deliver the larger current needed to start a diesel engine. I=emfrtot+RloadI=emfrtot+Rload rtotrtot Figure 21.19 Two voltage sources with identical emfs (each labeled by script E) connected in parallel produce the same emf but have a smaller total internal resistance than the individual sources. Parallel combinations are often used to deliver more current. Here I=emfrtot+RloadI=emfrtot+Rload flows through the load."
Page 241,"A number of animals both produce and detect electrical signals. Fish, sharks, platypuses, and echidnas (spiny anteaters) all detect electric fields generated by nerve activity in prey. Electric eels produce their own emf through biological cells (electric organs) called electroplaques, which are arranged in both series and parallel as a set of batteries. Electroplaques are flat, disk-like cells; those of the electric eel have a voltage of 0.15 V across each one. These cells are usually located toward the head or tail of the animal, although in the case of the electric eel, they are found along the entire body. The electroplaques in the South American eel are arranged in 140 rows, with each row stretching horizontally along the body and containing 5,000 electroplaques. This can yield an emf of approximately 600 V, and a current of 1 A—deadly. The mechanism for detection of external electric fields is similar to that for producing nerve signals in the cell through depolarization and repolarization—the movement of ions across the cell membrane. Within the fish, weak electric fields in the water produce a current in a gel-filled canal that runs from the skin to sensing cells, producing a nerve signal. The Australian platypus, one of the very few mammals that lay eggs, can detect fields of 30 mVmmVm, while sharks have been found to be able to sense a field in their snouts as small as 100 mVmmVm (Figure 21.20). Electric eels use their own electric fields produced by the electroplaques to stun their prey or enemies. mVmmVm mVmmVm Figure 21.20 Sand tiger sharks (Carcharias taurus), like this one at the Minnesota Zoo, use electroreceptors in their snouts to locate prey.

Page 241,"Another example dealing with multiple voltage sources is that of combinations of solar cells—wired in both series and parallel combinations to yield a desired voltage and current. Photovoltaic generation (PV), the conversion of sunlight directly into electricity, is based upon the photoelectric effect, in which photons hitting the surface of a solar cell create an electric current in the cell. Most solar cells are made from pure silicon—either as single-crystal silicon, or as a thin film of silicon deposited upon a glass or metal backing. Most single cells have a voltage output of about 0.5 V, while the current output is a function of the amount of sunlight upon the cell (the incident solar radiation—the insolation). Under bright noon sunlight, a current of about 100 mA/cm2100 mA/cm2 of cell surface area is produced by typical single-crystal cells. 100 mA/cm2100 mA/cm2 Individual solar cells are connected electrically in modules to meet electrical-energy needs. They can be wired together in series or in parallel—connected like the batteries discussed earlier. A solar-cell array or module usually consists of between 36 and 72 cells, with a power output of 50 W to 140 W. The output of the solar cells is direct current. For most uses in a home, AC is required, so a device called an inverter must be used to convert the DC to AC. Any extra output can then be passed on to the outside electrical grid for sale to the utility. Take-Home Experiment: Virtual Solar Cells One can assemble a “virtual” solar cell array by using playing cards, or business or index cards, to represent a solar cell. Combinations of these cards in series and/or parallel can model the required array output. Assume each card has an output of 0.5 V and a current (under bright light) of 2 A. Using your cards, how would you arrange them to produce an output of 6 A at 3 V (18 W)? Suppose you were told that you needed only 18 W (but no required voltage). Would you need more cards to make this arrangement?"

The loop rule is stated in terms of potential, VV, rather than potential energy, but the two are related since PEelec=qVPEelec=qV. Recall that emf is the potential difference of a source when no current is flowing.  In a closed loop, whatever energy is supplied by emf must be transferred into other forms by devices in the loop, since there are no other ways in which energy can be transferred into or out of the circuit.

Page 242,"By applying Kirchhoff’s rules, we generate equations that allow us to find the unknowns in circuits. The unknowns may be currents, emfs, or resistances. Each time a rule is applied, an equation is produced. If there are as many independent equations as unknowns, then the problem can be solved. There are two decisions you must make when applying Kirchhoff’s rules. These decisions determine the signs of various quantities in the equations you obtain from applying the rules. Figure 21.24 and the following points will help you get the plus or minus signs right when applying the loop rule. Note that the resistors and emfs are traversed by going from a to b. In many circuits, it will be necessary to construct more than one loop. In traversing each loop, one needs to be consistent for the sign of the change in potential. (See Example 21.5.) Figure 21.24 Each of these resistors and voltage sources is traversed from a to b. The potential changes are shown beneath each element and are explained in the text. (Note that the script E stands for emf.) Example 21.5 Find the currents flowing in the circuit in Figure 21.25. Figure 21.25 This circuit is similar to that in Figure 21.21, but the resistances and emfs are specified. (Each emf is denoted by script E.) The currents in each branch are labeled and assumed to move in the directions shown. This example uses Kirchhoff’s rules to find the currents. This circuit is sufficiently complex that the currents cannot be found using Ohm’s law and the series-parallel techniques—it is necessary to use Kirchhoff’s rules. Currents have been labeled I1I1, I2I2, and I3I3 in the figure and assumptions have been made about their directions. Locations on the diagram have been labeled with letters a through h. In the solution we will apply the junction and loop rules, seeking three independent equations to allow us to solve for the three unknown currents. I1I1 I2I2 I3I3 We begin by applying Kirchhoff’s first or junction rule at point a. This gives 21.54 since I1I1 flows into the junction, while I2I2 and I3I3 flow out. Applying the junction rule at e produces exactly the same equation, so that no new information is obtained. This is a single equation with three unknowns—three independent equations are needed, and so the loop rule must be applied. I1I1 I2I2 I3I3 Now we consider the loop abcdea. Going from a to b, we traverse R2R2 in the same (assumed) direction of the current I2I2, and so the change in potential is −I2R2−I2R2. Then going from b to c, we go from –– to +, so that the change in potential is +emf1+emf1. Traversing the internal resistance r1r1 from c to d gives −I2r1−I2r1. Completing the loop by going from d to a again traverses a resistor in the same direction as its current, giving a change in potential of −I1R1−I1R1. R2R2 I2I2 −I2R2−I2R2 –– +emf1+emf1 r1r1 −I2r1−I2r1 −I1R1−I1R1 The loop rule states that the changes in potential sum to zero. Thus, 21.55 Substituting values from the circuit diagram for the resistances and emf, and canceling the ampere unit gives 21.56 Now applying the loop rule to aefgha (we could have chosen abcdefgha as well) similarly gives 21.57 Note that the signs are reversed compared with the other loop, because elements are traversed in the opposite direction. With values entered, this becomes 21.58 These three equations are sufficient to solve for the three unknown currents. First, solve the second equation for I2I2: I2I2 21.59 Now solve the third equation for I3I3: I3I3 21.60 Substituting these two new equations into the first one allows us to find a value for I1I1: I1I1 21.61 Combining terms gives 21.62 21.63 Substituting this value for I1I1 back into the fourth equation gives I1I1 21.64 21.65 The minus sign means I2I2 flows in the direction opposite to that assumed in Figure 21.25. I2I2 Finally, substituting the value for I1I1 into the fifth equation gives I1I1 21.66 21.67 Just as a check, we note that indeed I1=I2+I3I1=I2+I3. The results could also have been checked by entering all of the values into the equation for the abcdefgha loop. I1=I2+I3I1=I2+I3 Problem-Solving Strategies for Kirchhoff’s Rules The material in this section is correct in theory. We should be able to verify it by making measurements of current and voltage. In fact, some of the devices used to make such measurements are straightforward applications of the principles covered so far and are explored in the next modules. As we shall see, a very basic, even profound, fact results—making a measurement alters the quantity being measured. Check Your Understanding Can Kirchhoff’s rules be applied to simple series and parallel circuits or are they restricted for use in more complicated circuits that are not combinations of series and parallel? Solution Kirchhoff's rules can be applied to any circuit since they are applications to circuits of two conservation laws. Conservation laws are the most broadly applicable principles in physics. It is usually mathematically simpler to use the rules for series and parallel in simpler circuits so we emphasize Kirchhoff’s rules for use in more complicated situations. But the rules for series and parallel can be derived from Kirchhoff’s rules. Moreover, Kirchhoff’s rules can be expanded to devices other than resistors and emfs, such as capacitors, and are one of the basic analysis devices in circuit analysis."

Page 243,"Analog meters have a needle that swivels to point at numbers on a scale, as opposed to digital meters, which have numerical readouts similar to a hand-held calculator. The heart of most analog meters is a device called a galvanometer, denoted by G. Current flow through a galvanometer, IGIG, produces a proportional needle deflection. (This deflection is due to the force of a magnetic field upon a current-carrying wire.) Analog meters digital meters galvanometer IGIG The two crucial characteristics of a given galvanometer are its resistance and current sensitivity. Current sensitivity is the current that gives a full-scale deflection of the galvanometer’s needle, the maximum current that the instrument can measure. For example, a galvanometer with a current sensitivity of 50 μA50 μA has a maximum deflection of its needle when 50 μA50 μA flows through it, reads half-scale when 25 μA25 μA flows through it, and so on. Current sensitivity full-scale deflection 50 μA50 μA 50 μA50 μA 25 μA25 μA If such a galvanometer has a 25-Ω25-Ω resistance, then a voltage of only V=IR=50 μA25 Ω=1.25 mVV=IR=50 μA25 Ω=1.25 mV produces a full-scale reading. By connecting resistors to this galvanometer in different ways, you can use it as either a voltmeter or ammeter that can measure a broad range of voltages or currents. 25-Ω25-Ω V=IR=50 μA25 Ω=1.25 mVV=IR=50 μA25 Ω=1.25 mV Figure 21.29 shows how a galvanometer can be used as a voltmeter by connecting it in series with a large resistance, RR. The value of the resistance RR is determined by the maximum voltage to be measured. Suppose you want 10 V to produce a full-scale deflection of a voltmeter containing a 25-Ω25-Ω galvanometer with a 50-μA50-μA sensitivity. Then 10 V applied to the meter must produce a current of 50 μA50 μA. The total resistance must be RR RR 25-Ω25-Ω 50-μA50-μA 50 μA50 μA 21.68 21.69 (RR is so large that the galvanometer resistance, rr, is nearly negligible.) Note that 5 V applied to this voltmeter produces a half-scale deflection by producing a 25-μA25-μA current through the meter, and so the voltmeter’s reading is proportional to voltage as desired. RR rr 25-μA25-μA This voltmeter would not be useful for voltages less than about half a volt, because the meter deflection would be small and difficult to read accurately. For other voltage ranges, other resistances are placed in series with the galvanometer. Many meters have a choice of scales. That choice involves switching an appropriate resistance into series with the galvanometer. Figure 21.29 A large resistance RR placed in series with a galvanometer G produces a voltmeter, the full-scale deflection of which depends on the choice of RR. The larger the voltage to be measured, the larger RR must be. (Note that rr  represents the internal resistance of the galvanometer.) The same galvanometer can also be made into an ammeter by placing it in parallel with a small resistance RR, often called the shunt resistance, as shown in Figure 21.30. Since the shunt resistance is small, most of the current passes through it, allowing an ammeter to measure currents much greater than those producing a full-scale deflection of the galvanometer. RR shunt resistance Suppose, for example, an ammeter is needed that gives a full-scale deflection for 1.0 A, and contains the same 25-Ω25-Ω galvanometer with its 50-μA50-μA sensitivity.

Page 243,"When you use a voltmeter or ammeter, you are connecting another resistor to an existing circuit and, thus, altering the circuit. Ideally, voltmeters and ammeters do not appreciably affect the circuit, but it is instructive to examine the circumstances under which they do or do not interfere. First, consider the voltmeter, which is always placed in parallel with the device being measured. Very little current flows through the voltmeter if its resistance is a few orders of magnitude greater than the device, and so the circuit is not appreciably affected. (See Figure 21.31(a).) (A large resistance in parallel with a small one has a combined resistance essentially equal to the small one.) If, however, the voltmeter’s resistance is comparable to that of the device being measured, then the two in parallel have a smaller resistance, appreciably affecting the circuit. (See Figure 21.31(b).) The voltage across the device is not the same as when the voltmeter is out of the circuit. Figure 21.31 (a) A voltmeter having a resistance much larger than the device (RVoltmeter>>RRVoltmeter>>R) with which it is in parallel produces a parallel resistance essentially the same as the device and does not appreciably affect the circuit being measured. (b) Here the voltmeter has the same resistance as the device (RVoltmeter≅RRVoltmeter≅R), so that the parallel resistance is half of what it is when the voltmeter is not connected. This is an example of a significant alteration of the circuit and is to be avoided. An ammeter is placed in series in the branch of the circuit being measured, so that its resistance adds to that branch. Normally, the ammeter’s resistance is very small compared with the resistances of the devices in the circuit, and so the extra resistance is negligible. (See Figure 21.32(a).) However, if very small load resistances are involved, or if the ammeter is not as low in resistance as it should be, then the total series resistance is significantly greater, and the current in the branch being measured is reduced. (See Figure 21.32(b).) A practical problem can occur if the ammeter is connected incorrectly. If it was put in parallel with the resistor to measure the current in it, you could possibly damage the meter; the low resistance of the ammeter would allow most of the current in the circuit to go through the galvanometer, and this current would be larger since the effective resistance is smaller. Figure 21.32 (a) An ammeter normally has such a small resistance that the total series resistance in the branch being measured is not appreciably increased. The circuit is essentially unaltered compared with when the ammeter is absent. (b) Here the ammeter’s resistance is the same as that of the branch, so that the total resistance is doubled and the current is half what it is without the ammeter. This significant alteration of the circuit is to be avoided. One solution to the problem of voltmeters and ammeters interfering with the circuits being measured is to use galvanometers with greater sensitivity. This allows construction of voltmeters with greater resistance and ammeters with smaller resistance than when less sensitive galvanometers are used. There are practical limits to galvanometer sensitivity, but it is possible to get analog meters that make measurements accurate to a few percent. Note that the inaccuracy comes from altering the circuit, not from a fault in the meter. Connections: Limits to Knowledge Making a measurement alters the system being measured in a manner that produces uncertainty in the measurement. For macroscopic systems, such as the circuits discussed in this module, the alteration can usually be made negligibly small, but it cannot be eliminated entirely. For submicroscopic systems, such as atoms, nuclei, and smaller particles, measurement alters the system in a manner that cannot be made arbitrarily small. This actually limits knowledge of the system—even limiting what nature can know about itself. We shall see profound implications of this when the Heisenberg uncertainty principle is discussed in the modules on quantum mechanics. There is another measurement technique based on drawing no current at all and, hence, not altering the circuit at all. These are called null measurements and are the topic of Null Measurements. Digital meters that employ solid-state electronics and null measurements can attain accuracies of one part in 106106. 106106 Check Your Understanding Digital meters are able to detect smaller currents than analog meters employing galvanometers. How does this explain their ability to measure voltage and current more accurately than analog meters? Solution Since digital meters require less current than analog meters, they alter the circuit less than analog meters. Their resistance as a voltmeter can be far greater than an analog meter, and their resistance as an ammeter can be far less than an analog meter.

Page 244,"Suppose you wish to measure the emf of a battery. Consider what happens if you connect the battery directly to a standard voltmeter as shown in Figure 21.33. (Once we note the problems with this measurement, we will examine a null measurement that improves accuracy.) As discussed before, the actual quantity measured is the terminal voltage VV, which is related to the emf of the battery by V=emf−IrV=emf−Ir, where II is the current that flows and rr is the internal resistance of the battery. VV V=emf−IrV=emf−Ir II rr The emf could be accurately calculated if rr were very accurately known, but it is usually not. If the current II could be made zero, then V=emfV=emf, and so emf could be directly measured. However, standard voltmeters need a current to operate; thus, another technique is needed. rr II V=emfV=emf Figure 21.33 An analog voltmeter attached to a battery draws a small but nonzero current and measures a terminal voltage that differs from the emf of the battery. (Note that the script capital E symbolizes electromotive force, or emf.) Since the internal resistance of the battery is not known precisely, it is not possible to calculate the emf precisely. A potentiometer is a null measurement device for measuring potentials (voltages). (See Figure 21.34.) A voltage source is connected to a resistor R,R, say, a long wire, and passes a constant current through it. There is a steady drop in potential (an IRIR drop) along the wire, so that a variable potential can be obtained by making contact at varying locations along the wire. potentiometer R,R, IRIR Figure 21.34(b) shows an unknown emfxemfx (represented by script ExEx  in the figure) connected in series with a galvanometer. Note that emfxemfx opposes the other voltage source. The location of the contact point (see the arrow on the drawing) is adjusted until the galvanometer reads zero. When the galvanometer reads zero, emfx=IRxemfx=IRx, where RxRx is the resistance of the section of wire up to the contact point. Since no current flows through the galvanometer, none flows through the unknown emf, and so emfxemfx is directly sensed. emfxemfx ExEx emfxemfx emfx=IRxemfx=IRx RxRx emfxemfx Now, a very precisely known standard emfsemfs is substituted for emfxemfx, and the contact point is adjusted until the galvanometer again reads zero, so that emfs=IRsemfs=IRs. In both cases, no current passes through the galvanometer, and so the current II through the long wire is the same. Upon taking the ratio 
emfxemfs
emfxemfs, II cancels, giving emfsemfs emfxemfx emfs=IRsemfs=IRs II emfxemfs
emfxemfs II 21.71 Solving for emfxemfx gives emfxemfx 21.72 Figure 21.34 The potentiometer, a null measurement device. (a) A voltage source connected to a long wire resistor passes a constant current II through it. (b) An unknown emf (labeled script ExEx in the figure) is connected as shown, and the point of contact along RR is adjusted until the galvanometer reads zero. The segment of wire has a resistance RxRx and script Ex=IRxEx=IRx, where II is unaffected by the connection since no current flows through the galvanometer. The unknown emf is thus proportional to the resistance of the wire segment. Because a long uniform wire is used for RR, the ratio of resistances Rx/RsRx/Rs is the same as the ratio of the lengths of wire that zero the galvanometer for each emf. The three quantities on the right-hand side of the equation are now known or measured, and emfxemfx can be calculated. The uncertainty in this calculation can be considerably smaller than when using a voltmeter directly, but it is not zero. There is always some uncertainty in the ratio of resistances Rx/RsRx/Rs and in the standard emfsemfs. Furthermore, it is not possible to tell when the galvanometer reads exactly zero, which introduces error into both RxRx and RsRs, and may also affect the current II.

Page 244,"There is a variety of so-called ohmmeters that purport to measure resistance. What the most common ohmmeters actually do is to apply a voltage to a resistance, measure the current, and calculate the resistance using Ohm’s law. Their readout is this calculated resistance. Two configurations for ohmmeters using standard voltmeters and ammeters are shown in Figure 21.35. Such configurations are limited in accuracy, because the meters alter both the voltage applied to the resistor and the current that flows through it. ohmmeters Figure 21.35 Two methods for measuring resistance with standard meters. (a) Assuming a known voltage for the source, an ammeter measures current, and resistance is calculated as R=VIR=VI. (b) Since the terminal voltage VV varies with current, it is better to measure it. VV is most accurately known when II is small, but II itself is most accurately known when it is large. The Wheatstone bridge is a null measurement device for calculating resistance by balancing potential drops in a circuit. (See Figure 21.36.) The device is called a bridge because the galvanometer forms a bridge between two branches. A variety of bridge devices are used to make null measurements in circuits. Wheatstone bridge bridge devices Resistors R1R1 and R2R2 are precisely known, while the arrow through R3R3 indicates that it is a variable resistance. The value of R3R3 can be precisely read. With the unknown resistance RxRx in the circuit, R3R3 is adjusted until the galvanometer reads zero. The potential difference between points b and d is then zero, meaning that b and d are at the same potential. With no current running through the galvanometer, it has no effect on the rest of the circuit. So the branches abc and adc are in parallel, and each branch has the full voltage of the source. That is, the IRIR drops along abc and adc are the same. Since b and d are at the same potential, the IRIR drop along ad must equal the IRIR drop along ab. Thus, R1R1 R2R2 R3R3 R3R3 RxRx R3R3 IRIR IRIR IRIR 21.73 Again, since b and d are at the same potential, the IRIR drop along dc must equal the IRIR drop along bc. Thus, IRIR IRIR 21.74 Taking the ratio of these last two expressions gives 21.75 Canceling the currents and solving for Rx yields 21.76 Figure 21.36 The Wheatstone bridge is used to calculate unknown resistances. The variable resistance R3R3 is adjusted until the galvanometer reads zero with the switch closed. This simplifies the circuit, allowing RxRx to be calculated based on the IRIR drops as discussed in the text. This equation is used to calculate the unknown resistance when current through the galvanometer is zero. This method can be very accurate (often to four significant digits), but it is limited by two factors. First, it is not possible to get the current through the galvanometer to be exactly zero. Second, there are always uncertainties in R1R1, R2R2, and R3R3, which contribute to the uncertainty in RxRx. R1R1 R2R2 R3R3 RxRx Check Your Understanding Identify other factors that might limit the accuracy of null measurements. Would the use of a digital device that is more sensitive than a galvanometer improve the accuracy of null measurements? Solution One factor would be resistance in the wires and connections in a null measurement. These are impossible to make zero, and they can change over time. Another factor would be temperature variations in resistance, which can be reduced but not completely eliminated by choice of material. Digital devices sensitive to smaller currents than analog devices do improve the accuracy of null measurements because they allow you to get the current closer to zero."

Page 245,"An RC circuit is one containing a resistor R and a capacitor C. The capacitor is an electrical component that stores electric charge. RC circuit resistor capacitor Figure 21.37 shows a simple RC circuit that employs a DC (direct current) voltage source. The capacitor is initially uncharged. As soon as the switch is closed, current flows to and from the initially uncharged capacitor. As charge increases on the capacitor plates, there is increasing opposition to the flow of charge by the repulsion of like charges on each plate. In terms of voltage, this is because voltage across the capacitor is given by Vc=Q/CVc=Q/C, where QQ is the amount of charge stored on each plate and CC is the capacitance. This voltage opposes the battery, growing from zero to the maximum emf when fully charged. The current thus decreases from its initial value of I0=emfRI0=emfR to zero as the voltage on the capacitor reaches the same value as the emf. When there is no current, there is no IRIR drop, and so the voltage on the capacitor must then equal the emf of the voltage source. This can also be explained with Kirchhoff’s second rule (the loop rule), discussed in Kirchhoff’s Rules, which says that the algebraic sum of changes in potential around any closed loop must be zero. Vc=Q/CVc=Q/C QQ CC capacitance I0=emfRI0=emfR IRIR The initial current is I0=emfRI0=emfR, because all of the IRIR drop is in the resistance. Therefore, the smaller the resistance, the faster a given capacitor will be charged. Note that the internal resistance of the voltage source is included in RR, as are the resistances of the capacitor and the connecting wires. In the flash camera scenario above, when the batteries powering the camera begin to wear out, their internal resistance rises, reducing the current and lengthening the time it takes to get ready for the next flash. I0=emfRI0=emfR IRIR RR Figure 21.37 (a) An RCRC circuit with an initially uncharged capacitor. Current flows in the direction shown (opposite of electron flow) as soon as the switch is closed. Mutual repulsion of like charges in the capacitor progressively slows the flow as the capacitor is charged, stopping the current when the capacitor is fully charged and Q=C⋅emfQ=C⋅emf. (b) A graph of voltage across the capacitor versus time, with the switch closing at time t=0t=0. (Note that in the two parts of the figure, the capital script E stands for emf, qq  stands for the charge stored on the capacitor, and  ττ is the RCRC  time constant.) Voltage on the capacitor is initially zero and rises rapidly at first, since the initial current is a maximum. Figure 21.37(b) shows a graph of capacitor voltage versus time (tt) starting when the switch is closed at t=0t=0. The voltage approaches emf asymptotically, since the closer it gets to emf the less current flows. The equation for voltage versus time when charging a capacitor CC through a resistor RR, derived using calculus, is tt t=0t=0 CC RR 21.77 where VV is the voltage across the capacitor, emf is equal to the emf of the DC voltage source, and the exponential e = 2.718 … is the base of the natural logarithm. Note that the units of RCRC are seconds. We define VV RCRC 21.78 where ττ (the Greek letter tau) is called the time constant for an RCRC circuit. As noted before, a small resistance RR allows the capacitor to charge faster. This is reasonable, since a larger current flows through a smaller resistance. It is also reasonable that the smaller the capacitor CC, the less time needed to charge it. Both factors are contained in τ=RCτ=RC. ττ RCRC RR CC τ=RCτ=RC More quantitatively, consider what happens when t=τ=RCt=τ=RC. Then the voltage on the capacitor is t=τ=RCt=τ=RC 21.79 This means that in the time τ=RCτ=RC, the voltage rises to 0.632 of its final value. The voltage will rise 0.632 of the remainder in the next time ττ. It is a characteristic of the exponential function that the final value is never reached, but 0.632 of the remainder to that value is achieved in every time, ττ. In just a few multiples of the time constant ττ, then, the final value is very nearly achieved, as the graph in Figure 21.37(b) illustrates. τ=RCτ=RC ττ ττ ττ"
Page 245,"Discharging a capacitor through a resistor proceeds in a similar fashion, as Figure 21.38 illustrates. Initially, the current is I0=V0RI0=V0R, driven by the initial voltage V0V0 on the capacitor. As the voltage decreases, the current and hence the rate of discharge decreases, implying another exponential formula for VV. Using calculus, the voltage VV on a capacitor CC being discharged through a resistor RR is found to be I0=V0RI0=V0R V0V0 VV VV CC RR 21.80 Figure 21.38 (a) Closing the switch discharges the capacitor CC through the resistor RR.

 at t=0t=0. The voltage decreases exponentially, falling a fixed fraction of the way to zero in each subsequent time constant ττ. The graph in Figure 21.38(b) is an example of this exponential decay. Again, the time constant is τ=RCτ=RC. A small resistance RR allows the capacitor to discharge in a small time, since the current is larger. Similarly, a small capacitance requires less time to discharge, since less charge is stored. In the first time interval τ=RCτ=RC after the switch is closed, the voltage falls to 0.368 of its initial value, since V=V0⋅e−1=0.368V0V=V0⋅e−1=0.368V0. τ=RCτ=RC RR τ=RCτ=RC V=V0⋅e−1=0.368V0V=V0⋅e−1=0.368V0 During each successive time ττ, the voltage falls to 0.368 of its preceding value. In a few multiples of ττ, the voltage becomes very close to zero, as indicated by the graph in Figure 21.38(b). ττ ττ Now we can explain why the flash camera in our scenario takes so much longer to charge than discharge; the resistance while charging is significantly greater than while discharging. The internal resistance of the battery accounts for most of the resistance while charging. As the battery ages, the increasing internal resistance makes the charging process even slower. (You may have noticed this.) The flash discharge is through a low-resistance ionized gas in the flash tube and proceeds very rapidly. Flash photographs, such as in Figure 21.39, can capture a brief instant of a rapid motion because the flash can be less than a microsecond in duration. Such flashes can be made extremely intense. During World War II, nighttime reconnaissance photographs were made from the air with a single flash illuminating more than a square kilometer of enemy territory. The brevity of the flash eliminated blurring due to the surveillance aircraft’s motion. Today, an important use of intense flash lamps is to pump energy into a laser. The short intense flash can rapidly energize a laser and allow it to reemit the energy in another form. Figure 21.39 This stop-motion photograph of a rufous hummingbird (Selasphorus rufus) feeding on a flower was obtained with an extremely brief and intense flash of light powered by the discharge of a capacitor through a gas. (credit: Dean E. Biggins, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service) Example 21.6 High-speed flash photography was pioneered by Doc Edgerton in the 1930s, while he was a professor of electrical engineering at MIT. You might have seen examples of his work in the amazing shots of hummingbirds in motion, a drop of milk splattering on a table, or a bullet penetrating an apple (see Figure 21.39). To stop the motion and capture these pictures, one needs a high-intensity, very short pulsed flash, as mentioned earlier in this module. Suppose one wished to capture the picture of a bullet (moving at 5.0×102m/s5.0×102m/s) that was passing through an apple. The duration of the flash is related to the RCRC time constant, ττ. What size capacitor would one need in the RCRC circuit to succeed, if the resistance of the flash tube was 10.0 Ω10.0 Ω? Assume the apple is a sphere with a diameter of  8.0×10–2m.8.0×10–2m. 5.0×102m/s5.0×102m/s RCRC ττ RCRC 10.0 Ω10.0 Ω 8.0×10–2m.8.0×10–2m. We begin by identifying the physical principles involved. This example deals with the strobe light, as discussed above. Figure 21.38 shows the circuit for this probe. The characteristic time ττ of the strobe is given as τ=RCτ=RC. ττ τ=RCτ=RC We wish to find CC, but we don’t know ττ. We want the flash to be on only while the bullet traverses the apple. So we need to use the kinematic equations that describe the relationship between distance xx, velocity vv, and time tt: CC ττ xx vv tt 21.81 The bullet’s velocity is given as 5.0×102m/s5.0×102m/s, and the distance xx is 8.0×10–2m.8.0×10–2m. The traverse time, then, is 5.0×102m/s5.0×102m/s xx 8.0×10–2m.8.0×10–2m. 21.82 We set this value for the crossing time tt equal to ττ. Therefore, tt ττ 21.83 (Note: Capacitance CC is typically measured in farads,

The information from the picture of the apple and bullet was used in the Warren Commission Report on the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in 1963 to confirm that only one bullet was fired. 160 μs160 μs"
Page 245,"RCRC circuits are commonly used for timing purposes. A mundane example of this is found in the ubiquitous intermittent wiper systems of modern cars. The time between wipes is varied by adjusting the resistance in an RCRC circuit. Another example of an RCRC circuit is found in novelty jewelry, Halloween costumes, and various toys that have battery-powered flashing lights. (See Figure 21.40 for a timing circuit.) RCRC RCRC RCRC A more crucial use of RCRC circuits for timing purposes is in the artificial pacemaker, used to control heart rate. The heart rate is normally controlled by electrical signals generated by the sino-atrial (SA) node, which is on the wall of the right atrium chamber. This causes the muscles to contract and pump blood. Sometimes the heart rhythm is abnormal and the heartbeat is too high or too low. RCRC The artificial pacemaker is inserted near the heart to provide electrical signals to the heart when needed with the appropriate time constant. Pacemakers have sensors that detect body motion and breathing to increase the heart rate during exercise to meet the body’s increased needs for blood and oxygen. Figure 21.40 (a) The lamp in this RCRC circuit ordinarily has a very high resistance, so that the battery charges the capacitor as if the lamp were not there. When the voltage reaches a threshold value, a current flows through the lamp that dramatically reduces its resistance, and the capacitor discharges through the lamp as if the battery and charging resistor were not there. Once discharged, the process starts again, with the flash period determined by the RCRC constant ττ. (b) A graph of voltage versus time for this circuit. Example 21.7 A heart defibrillator is used to resuscitate an accident victim by discharging a capacitor through the trunk of her body. A simplified version of the circuit is seen in Figure 21.38. (a) What is the time constant if an 8.00-μF8.00-μF capacitor is used and the path resistance through her body is 1.00×103Ω1.00×103Ω? (b) If the initial voltage is 10.0 kV, how long does it take to decline to
5.00×102V5.00×102V? 8.00-μF8.00-μF 1.00×103Ω1.00×103Ω 5.00×102V5.00×102V Since the resistance and capacitance are given, it is straightforward to multiply them to give the time constant asked for in part (a). To find the time for the voltage to decline to
5.00×102V5.00×102V, we repeatedly multiply the initial voltage by 0.368 until a voltage less than or equal to
5.00×102V5.00×102V  is obtained. Each multiplication corresponds to a time of ττ seconds. 5.00×102V5.00×102V 5.00×102V5.00×102V ττ The time constant ττ is given by the equation τ=RCτ=RC. Entering the given values for resistance and capacitance (and remembering that units for a farad can be expressed as s/Ωs/Ω) gives ττ τ=RCτ=RC s/Ωs/Ω 21.84 In the first 8.00 ms, the voltage (10.0 kV) declines to 0.368 of its initial value. That is: 21.85 (Notice that we carry an extra digit for each intermediate calculation.) After another 8.00 ms, we multiply by 0.368 again, and the voltage is 21.86 Similarly, after another 8.00 ms, the voltage is 21.87 So after only 24.0 ms, the voltage is down to 498 V, or 4.98% of its original value.Such brief times are useful in heart defibrillation, because the brief but intense current causes a brief but effective contraction of the heart. The actual circuit in a heart defibrillator is slightly more complex than the one in Figure 21.38, to compensate for magnetic and AC effects that will be covered in Magnetism. Check Your Understanding When is the potential difference across a capacitor an emf? Solution Only when the current being drawn from or put into the capacitor is zero. Capacitors, like batteries, have internal resistance, so their output voltage is not an emf unless current is zero. This is difficult to measure in practice so we refer to a capacitor’s voltage rather than its emf. But the source of potential difference in a capacitor is fundamental and it is an emf."

An electronic apparatus may have large capacitors at high voltage in the power supply section, presenting a shock hazard even when the apparatus is switched off. A “bleeder resistor” is therefore placed across such a capacitor, as shown schematically in Figure 21.48, to bleed the charge from it after the apparatus is off.

Page 251,It is a universal characteristic of all magnets that like poles repel and unlike poles attract. (Note the similarity with electrostatics:  unlike charges attract and like charges repel.) Further experimentation shows that it is impossible to separate north and south poles in the manner that + and − charges can be separated.

Page 252,"Only certain materials, such as iron, cobalt, nickel, and gadolinium, exhibit strong magnetic effects. Such materials are called ferromagnetic, after the Latin word for iron, ferrum. A group of materials made from the alloys of the rare earth elements are also used as strong and permanent magnets; a popular one is neodymium. Other materials exhibit weak magnetic effects, which are detectable only with sensitive instruments. Not only do ferromagnetic materials respond strongly to magnets (the way iron is attracted to magnets), they can also be magnetized themselves—that is, they can be induced to be magnetic or made into permanent magnets. ferromagnetic magnetized Figure 22.7 An unmagnetized piece of iron is placed between two magnets, heated, and then cooled, or simply tapped when cold. The iron becomes a permanent magnet with the poles aligned as shown: its south pole is adjacent to the north pole of the original magnet, and its north pole is adjacent to the south pole of the original magnet. Note that there are attractive forces between the magnets. When a magnet is brought near a previously unmagnetized ferromagnetic material, it causes local magnetization of the material with unlike poles closest, as in Figure 22.7. (This results in the attraction of the previously unmagnetized material to the magnet.) What happens on a microscopic scale is illustrated in Figure 22.8. The regions within the material called domains act like small bar magnets. Within domains, the poles of individual atoms are aligned. Each atom acts like a tiny bar magnet. Domains are small and randomly oriented in an unmagnetized ferromagnetic object. In response to an external magnetic field, the domains may grow to millimeter size, aligning themselves as shown in Figure 22.8(b). This induced magnetization can be made permanent if the material is heated and then cooled, or simply tapped in the presence of other magnets. domains Figure 22.8 (a) An unmagnetized piece of iron (or other ferromagnetic material) has randomly oriented domains. (b) When magnetized by an external field, the domains show greater alignment, and some grow at the expense of others. Individual atoms are aligned within domains; each atom acts like a tiny bar magnet. Conversely, a permanent magnet can be demagnetized by hard blows or by heating it in the absence of another magnet. Increased thermal motion at higher temperature can disrupt and randomize the orientation and the size of the domains. There is a well-defined temperature for ferromagnetic materials, which is called the Curie temperature, above which they cannot be magnetized. The Curie temperature for iron is 1043 K (770ºC)(770ºC), which is well above room temperature. There are several elements and alloys that have Curie temperatures much lower than room temperature and are ferromagnetic only below those temperatures. Curie temperature (770ºC)(770ºC)"
Page 252,"Early in the 19th century, it was discovered that electrical currents cause magnetic effects. The first significant observation was by the Danish scientist Hans Christian Oersted (1777–1851), who found that a compass needle was deflected by a current-carrying wire. This was the first significant evidence that the movement of charges had any connection with magnets. Electromagnetism is the use of electric current to make magnets. These temporarily induced magnets are called electromagnets. Electromagnets are employed for everything from a wrecking yard crane that lifts scrapped cars to controlling the beam of a 90-km-circumference particle accelerator to the magnets in medical imaging machines (See Figure 22.9). Electromagnetism electromagnets Figure 22.9 Instrument for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The device uses a superconducting cylindrical coil for the main magnetic field. The patient goes into this “tunnel” on the gurney. (credit: Bill McChesney, Flickr) Figure 22.10 shows that the response of iron filings to a current-carrying coil and to a permanent bar magnet. The patterns are similar. In fact, electromagnets and ferromagnets have the same basic characteristics—for example, they have north and south poles that cannot be separated and for which like poles repel and unlike poles attract. Figure 22.10 Iron filings near (a) a current-carrying coil and (b) a magnet act like tiny compass needles, showing the shape of their fields. Their response to a current-carrying coil and a permanent magnet is seen to be very similar, especially near the ends of the coil and the magnet. Combining a ferromagnet with an electromagnet can produce particularly strong magnetic effects. (See Figure 22.11.) Whenever strong magnetic effects are needed, such as lifting scrap metal, or in particle accelerators, electromagnets are enhanced by ferromagnetic materials. Limits to how strong the magnets can be made are imposed by coil resistance (it will overheat and melt at sufficiently high current), and so superconducting magnets may be employed. These are still limited, because superconducting properties are destroyed by too great a magnetic field. Figure 22.11 An electromagnet with a ferromagnetic core can produce very strong magnetic effects. Alignment of domains in the core produces a magnet, the poles of which are aligned with the electromagnet. Figure 22.12 shows a few uses of combinations of electromagnets and ferromagnets. Ferromagnetic materials can act as memory devices, because the orientation of the magnetic fields of small domains can be reversed or erased. Magnetic information storage on videotapes and computer hard drives are among the most common applications. This property is vital in our digital world. Figure 22.12 An electromagnet induces regions of permanent magnetism on a floppy disk coated with a ferromagnetic material. The information stored here is digital (a region is either magnetic or not); in other applications, it can be analog (with a varying strength), such as on audiotapes."
Page 252,"An electromagnet creates magnetism with an electric current. In later sections we explore this more quantitatively, finding the strength and direction of magnetic fields created by various currents. But what about ferromagnets? Figure 22.13 shows models of how electric currents create magnetism at the submicroscopic level. (Note that we cannot directly observe the paths of individual electrons about atoms, and so a model or visual image, consistent with all direct observations, is made. We can directly observe the electron’s orbital angular momentum, its spin momentum, and subsequent magnetic moments, all of which are explained with electric-current-creating subatomic magnetism.) Currents, including those associated with other submicroscopic particles like protons, allow us to explain ferromagnetism and all other magnetic effects. Ferromagnetism, for example, results from an internal cooperative alignment of electron spins, possible in some materials but not in others. Crucial to the statement that electric current is the source of all magnetism is the fact that it is impossible to separate north and south magnetic poles. (This is far different from the case of positive and negative charges, which are easily separated.) A current loop always produces a magnetic dipole—that is, a magnetic field that acts like a north pole and south pole pair. Since isolated north and south magnetic poles, called magnetic monopoles, are not observed, currents are used to explain all magnetic effects. If magnetic monopoles did exist, then we would have to modify this underlying connection that all magnetism is due to electrical current. There is no known reason that magnetic monopoles should not exist—they are simply never observed—and so searches at the subnuclear level continue. If they do not exist, we would like to find out why not. If they do exist, we would like to see evidence of them. magnetic monopoles Electric Currents and Magnetism Electric current is the source of all magnetism. Figure 22.13 (a) In the planetary model of the atom, an electron orbits a nucleus, forming a closed-current loop and producing a magnetic field with a north pole and a south pole. (b) Electrons have spin and can be crudely pictured as rotating charge, forming a current that produces a magnetic field with a north pole and a south pole. Neither the planetary model nor the image of a spinning electron is completely consistent with modern physics. However, they do provide a useful way of understanding phenomena.

Page 254,"The magnetic force on a moving charge is one of the most fundamental known. Magnetic force is as important as the electrostatic or Coulomb force. Yet the magnetic force is more complex, in both the number of factors that affects it and in its direction, than the relatively simple Coulomb force. The magnitude of the magnetic force FF on a charge qq moving at a speed vv in a magnetic field of strength BB is given by magnetic force FF qq vv BB 22.1 where θθ is the angle between the directions of vv and B.B. This force is often called the Lorentz force. In fact, this is how we define the magnetic field strength BB—in terms of the force on a charged particle moving in a magnetic field. The SI unit for magnetic field strength BB is called the tesla (T) after the eccentric but brilliant inventor Nikola Tesla (1856–1943). To determine how the tesla relates to other SI units, we solve F=qvBsinθF=qvBsinθ for BB. θθ vv B.B. Lorentz force BB BB tesla F=qvBsinθF=qvBsinθ BB 22.2 Because

The strongest permanent magnets have fields near 2 T; superconducting electromagnets may attain 10 T or more. The Earth’s magnetic field on its surface is only about 5×10−5T5×10−5T, or 0.5 G. gauss 1 G=10−4T1 G=10−4T 5×10−5T5×10−5T The direction of the magnetic force FF is perpendicular to the plane formed by vv and BB, as determined by the right hand rule 1 (or RHR-1), which is illustrated in Figure 22.16. RHR-1 states that, to determine the direction of the magnetic force on a positive moving charge, you point the thumb of the right hand in the direction of vv, the fingers in the direction of BB, and a perpendicular to the palm points in the direction of FF. One way to remember this is that there is one velocity, and so the thumb represents it. There are many field lines, and so the fingers represent them. The force is in the direction you would push with your palm. The force on a negative charge is in exactly the opposite direction to that on a positive charge. FF vv BB right hand rule 1 vv BB FF Figure 22.16 Magnetic fields exert forces on moving charges. This force is one of the most basic known. The direction of the magnetic force on a moving charge is perpendicular to the plane formed by vv and BB and follows right hand rule–1 (RHR-1) as shown. The magnitude of the force is proportional to qq, vv, BB, and the sine of the angle between vv and BB. Making Connections: Charges and Magnets There is no magnetic force on static charges. However, there is a magnetic force on moving charges. When charges are stationary, their electric fields do not affect magnets. But, when charges move, they produce magnetic fields that exert forces on other magnets. When there is relative motion, a connection between electric and magnetic fields emerges—each affects the other. Example 22.1 With the exception of compasses, you seldom see or personally experience forces due to the Earth’s small magnetic field. To illustrate this, suppose that in a physics lab you rub a glass rod with silk, placing a 20-nC positive charge on it. Calculate the force on the rod due to the Earth’s magnetic field, if you throw it with a horizontal velocity of 10 m/s due west in a place where the Earth’s field is due north parallel to the ground. (The direction of the force is determined with right hand rule 1 as shown in Figure 22.17.) Figure 22.17 A positively charged object moving due west in a region where the Earth’s magnetic field is due north experiences a force that is straight down as shown. A negative charge moving in the same direction would feel a force straight up. We are given the charge, its velocity, and the magnetic field strength and direction. We can thus use the equation F=qvBsinθF=qvBsinθ to find the force. F=qvBsinθF=qvBsinθ The magnetic force is 22.4 We see that sinθ=1sinθ=1, since the angle between the velocity and the direction of the field is 90º90º. Entering the other given quantities yields sinθ=1sinθ=1 90º90º 22.5 This force is completely negligible on any macroscopic object, consistent with experience. (It is calculated to only one digit, since the Earth’s field varies with location and is given to only one digit.) The Earth’s magnetic field, however, does produce very important effects, particularly on submicroscopic particles. Some of these are explored in Force on a Moving Charge in a Magnetic Field: Examples and Applications."

Page 259,"Magnetic fields have both direction and magnitude. As noted before, one way to explore the direction of a magnetic field is with compasses, as shown for a long straight current-carrying wire in Figure 22.37. Hall probes can determine the magnitude of the field. The field around a long straight wire is found to be in circular loops. The right hand rule 2 (RHR-2) emerges from this exploration and is valid for any current segment—point the thumb in the direction of the current, and the fingers curl in the direction of the magnetic field loops created by it. right hand rule 2 Figure 22.37 (a) Compasses placed near a long straight current-carrying wire indicate that field lines form circular loops centered on the wire. (b) Right hand rule 2 states that, if the right hand thumb points in the direction of the current, the fingers curl in the direction of the field. This rule is consistent with the field mapped for the long straight wire and is valid for any current segment. The magnetic field strength (magnitude) produced by a long straight current-carrying wire is found by experiment to be magnetic field strength (magnitude) produced by a long straight current-carrying wire 22.24 where II is the current, rr is the shortest distance to the wire, and the constant μ0=4π×10−7T⋅m/Aμ0=4π×10−7T⋅m/A is the permeability of free space.
(μ0(μ0 is one of the basic constants in nature. We will see later that μ0μ0 is related to the speed of light.) Since the wire is very long, the magnitude of the field depends only on distance from the wire rr, not on position along the wire.

Page 259,"The magnetic field of a long straight wire has more implications than you might at first suspect. Each segment of current produces a magnetic field like that of a long straight wire, and the total field of any shape current is the vector sum of the fields due to each segment. The formal statement of the direction and magnitude of the field due to each segment is called the Biot-Savart law. Integral calculus is needed to sum the field for an arbitrary shape current. This results in a more complete law, called Ampere’s law, which relates magnetic field and current in a general way. Ampere’s law in turn is a part of Maxwell’s equations, which give a complete theory of all electromagnetic phenomena. Considerations of how Maxwell’s equations appear to different observers led to the modern theory of relativity, and the realization that electric and magnetic fields are different manifestations of the same thing. Most of this is beyond the scope of this text in both mathematical level, requiring calculus, and in the amount of space that can be devoted to it. But for the interested student, and particularly for those who continue in physics, engineering, or similar pursuits, delving into these matters further will reveal descriptions of nature that are elegant as well as profound. In this text, we shall keep the general features in mind, such as RHR-2 and the rules for magnetic field lines listed in Magnetic Fields and Magnetic Field Lines, while concentrating on the fields created in certain important situations. Biot-Savart law Ampere’s law Maxwell’s equations Making Connections: Relativity Hearing all we do about Einstein, we sometimes get the impression that he invented relativity out of nothing. On the contrary, one of Einstein’s motivations was to solve difficulties in knowing how different observers see magnetic and electric fields."
Page 259,"The magnetic field near a current-carrying loop of wire is shown in Figure 22.38. Both the direction and the magnitude of the magnetic field produced by a current-carrying loop are complex. RHR-2 can be used to give the direction of the field near the loop, but mapping with compasses and the rules about field lines given in Magnetic Fields and Magnetic Field Lines are needed for more detail. There is a simple formula for the magnetic field strength at the center of a circular loop. It is magnetic field strength at the center of a circular loop 22.26 where RR is the radius of the loop. This equation is very similar to that for a straight wire, but it is valid only at the center of a circular loop of wire. The similarity of the equations does indicate that similar field strength can be obtained at the center of a loop. One way to get a larger field is to have NN loops; then, the field is B=Nμ0I/(2R)B=Nμ0I/(2R). Note that the larger the loop, the smaller the field at its center, because the current is farther away. RR NN B=Nμ0I/(2R)B=Nμ0I/(2R) Figure 22.38 (a) RHR-2 gives the direction of the magnetic field inside and outside a current-carrying loop. (b) More detailed mapping with compasses or with a Hall probe completes the picture. The field is similar to that of a bar magnet."
Page 259,"A solenoid is a long coil of wire (with many turns or loops, as opposed to a flat loop). Because of its shape, the field inside a solenoid can be very uniform, and also very strong. The field just outside the coils is nearly zero. Figure 22.39 shows how the field looks and how its direction is given by RHR-2. solenoid Figure 22.39 (a) Because of its shape, the field inside a solenoid of length ll is remarkably uniform in magnitude and direction, as indicated by the straight and uniformly spaced field lines. The field outside the coils is nearly zero. (b) This cutaway shows the magnetic field generated by the current in the solenoid. The magnetic field inside of a current-carrying solenoid is very uniform in direction and magnitude. Only near the ends does it begin to weaken and change direction. The field outside has similar complexities to flat loops and bar magnets, but the magnetic field strength inside a solenoid is simply magnetic field strength inside a solenoid 22.27 where nn is the number of loops per unit length of the solenoid (n=N/l(n=N/l, with NN being the number of loops and ll the length). Note that BB is the field strength anywhere in the uniform region of the interior and not just at the center. Large uniform fields spread over a large volume are possible with solenoids, as Example 22.7 implies. nn (n=N/l(n=N/l NN ll BB Example 22.7 What is the field inside a 2.00-m-long solenoid that has 2000 loops and carries a 1600-A current? To find the field strength inside a solenoid, we use B=μ0nIB=μ0nI. First, we note the number of loops per unit length is B=μ0nIB=μ0nI 22.28 Substituting known values gives 22.29 This is a large field strength that could be established over a large-diameter solenoid, such as in medical uses of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The very large current is an indication that the fields of this strength are not easily achieved, however. Such a large current through 1000 loops squeezed into a meter’s length would produce significant heating. Higher currents can be achieved by using superconducting wires, although this is expensive. There is an upper limit to the current, since the superconducting state is disrupted by very large magnetic fields. There are interesting variations of the flat coil and solenoid. For example, the toroidal coil used to confine the reactive particles in tokamaks is much like a solenoid bent into a circle. The field inside a toroid is very strong but circular. Charged particles travel in circles, following the field lines, and collide with one another, perhaps inducing fusion. But the charged particles do not cross field lines and escape the toroid. A whole range of coil shapes are used to produce all sorts of magnetic field shapes. Adding ferromagnetic materials produces greater field strengths and can have a significant effect on the shape of the field. Ferromagnetic materials tend to trap magnetic fields (the field lines bend into the ferromagnetic material, leaving weaker fields outside it) and are used as shields for devices that are adversely affected by magnetic fields, including the Earth’s magnetic field."

Page 261,"The curved paths followed by charged particles in magnetic fields can be put to use. A charged particle moving perpendicular to a magnetic field travels in a circular path having a radius rr. rr 22.34 It was noted that this relationship could be used to measure the mass of charged particles such as ions. A mass spectrometer is a device that measures such masses. Most mass spectrometers use magnetic fields for this purpose, although some of them have extremely sophisticated designs. Since there are five variables in the relationship, there are many possibilities. However, if vv, qq, and BB can be fixed, then the radius of the path rr is simply proportional to the mass mm of the charged particle. Let us examine one such mass spectrometer that has a relatively simple design. (See Figure 22.41.) The process begins with an ion source, a device like an electron gun. The ion source gives ions their charge, accelerates them to some velocity vv, and directs a beam of them into the next stage of the spectrometer. This next region is a velocity selector that only allows particles with a particular value of vv to get through. vv qq BB rr mm vv vv Figure 22.41 This mass spectrometer uses a velocity selector to fix vv so that the radius of the path is proportional to mass. The velocity selector has both an electric field and a magnetic field, perpendicular to one another, producing forces in opposite directions on the ions. Only those ions for which the forces balance travel in a straight line into the next region. If the forces balance, then the electric force F=qEF=qE equals the magnetic force F=qvBF=qvB, so that qE=qvBqE=qvB. Noting that qq cancels, we see that F=qEF=qE F=qvBF=qvB qE=qvBqE=qvB qq 22.35 is the velocity particles must have to make it through the velocity selector, and further, that vv can be selected by varying EE and BB. In the final region, there is only a uniform magnetic field, and so the charged particles move in circular arcs with radii proportional to particle mass. The paths also depend on charge qq, but since qq is in multiples of electron charges, it is easy to determine and to discriminate between ions in different charge states. vv EE BB qq qq Mass spectrometry today is used extensively in chemistry and biology laboratories to identify chemical and biological substances according to their mass-to-charge ratios. In medicine, mass spectrometers are used to measure the concentration of isotopes used as tracers. Usually, biological molecules such as proteins are very large, so they are broken down into smaller fragments before analyzing. Recently, large virus particles have been analyzed as a whole on mass spectrometers. Sometimes a gas chromatograph or high-performance liquid chromatograph provides an initial separation of the large molecules, which are then input into the mass spectrometer."
Page 261,"What do non-flat-screen TVs, old computer monitors, x-ray machines, and the 2-mile-long Stanford Linear Accelerator have in common? All of them accelerate electrons, making them different versions of the electron gun. Many of these devices use magnetic fields to steer the accelerated electrons. Figure 22.42 shows the construction of the type of cathode ray tube (CRT) found in some TVs, oscilloscopes, and old computer monitors. Two pairs of coils are used to steer the electrons, one vertically and the other horizontally, to their desired destination. Figure 22.42 The cathode ray tube (CRT) is so named because rays of electrons originate at the cathode in the electron gun. Magnetic coils are used to steer the beam in many CRTs. In this case, the beam is moved down. Another pair of horizontal coils would steer the beam horizontally."
Page 261,"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is one of the most useful and rapidly growing medical imaging tools. It non-invasively produces two-dimensional and three-dimensional images of the body that provide important medical information with none of the hazards of x-rays. MRI is based on an effect called nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) in which an externally applied magnetic field interacts with the nuclei of certain atoms, particularly those of hydrogen (protons). These nuclei possess their own small magnetic fields, similar to those of electrons and the current loops discussed earlier in this chapter. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) When placed in an external magnetic field, such nuclei experience a torque that pushes or aligns the nuclei into one of two new energy states—depending on the orientation of its spin (analogous to the N pole and S pole in a bar magnet). Transitions from the lower to higher energy state can be achieved by using an external radio frequency signal to “flip” the orientation of the small magnets. (This is actually a quantum mechanical process. The direction of the nuclear magnetic field is quantized as is energy in the radio waves. We will return to these topics in later chapters.) The specific frequency of the radio waves that are absorbed and reemitted depends sensitively on the type of nucleus, the chemical environment, and the external magnetic field strength. Therefore, this is a resonance phenomenon in which nuclei in a magnetic field act like resonators (analogous to those discussed in the treatment of sound in Oscillatory Motion and Waves) that absorb and reemit only certain frequencies. Hence, the phenomenon is named nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). NMR has been used for more than 50 years as an analytical tool. It was formulated in 1946 by F. Bloch and E. Purcell, with the 1952 Nobel Prize in Physics going to them for their work. Over the past two decades, NMR has been developed to produce detailed images in a process now called magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a name coined to avoid the use of the word “nuclear” and the concomitant implication that nuclear radiation is involved. (It is not.) The 2003 Nobel Prize in Medicine went to P. Lauterbur and P. Mansfield for their work with MRI applications. The largest part of the MRI unit is a superconducting magnet that creates a magnetic field, typically between 1 and 2 T in strength, over a relatively large volume. MRI images can be both highly detailed and informative about structures and organ functions. It is helpful that normal and non-normal tissues respond differently for slight changes in the magnetic field. In most medical images, the protons that are hydrogen nuclei are imaged. (About 2/3 of the atoms in the body are hydrogen.) Their location and density give a variety of medically useful information, such as organ function, the condition of tissue (as in the brain), and the shape of structures, such as vertebral disks and knee-joint surfaces. MRI can also be used to follow the movement of certain ions across membranes, yielding information on active transport, osmosis, dialysis, and other phenomena. With excellent spatial resolution, MRI can provide information about tumors, strokes, shoulder injuries, infections, etc. An image requires position information as well as the density of a nuclear type (usually protons). By varying the magnetic field slightly over the volume to be imaged, the resonant frequency of the protons is made to vary with position. Broadcast radio frequencies are swept over an appropriate range and nuclei absorb and reemit them only if the nuclei are in a magnetic field with the correct strength. The imaging receiver gathers information through the body almost point by point, building up a tissue map. The reception of reemitted radio waves as a function of frequency thus gives position information. These “slices” or cross sections through the body are only several mm thick. The intensity of the reemitted radio waves is proportional to the concentration of the nuclear type being flipped, as well as information on the chemical environment in that area of the body. Various techniques are available for enhancing contrast in images and for obtaining more information. Scans called T1, T2, or proton density scans rely on different relaxation mechanisms of nuclei. Relaxation refers to the time it takes for the protons to return to equilibrium after the external field is turned off. This time depends upon tissue type and status (such as inflammation). While MRI images are superior to x rays for certain types of tissue and have none of the hazards of x rays, they do not completely supplant x-ray images. MRI is less effective than x rays for detecting breaks in bone, for example, and in imaging breast tissue, so the two diagnostic tools complement each other. MRI images are also expensive compared to simple x-ray images and tend to be used most often where they supply information not readily obtained from x rays. Another disadvantage of MRI is that the patient is totally enclosed with detectors close to the body for about 30 minutes or more, leading to claustrophobia. It is also difficult for the obese patient to be in the magnet tunnel. New “open-MRI” machines are now available in which the magnet does not completely surround the patient. Over the last decade, the development of much faster scans, called “functional MRI” (fMRI), has allowed us to map the functioning of various regions in the brain responsible for thought and motor control. This technique measures the change in blood flow for activities (thought, experiences, action) in the brain. The nerve cells increase their consumption of oxygen when active. Blood hemoglobin releases oxygen to active nerve cells and has somewhat different magnetic properties when oxygenated than when deoxygenated. With MRI, we can measure this and detect a blood oxygen-dependent signal. Most of the brain scans today use fMRI."
Page 261,"Currents in nerve cells and the heart create magnetic fields like any other currents. These can be measured but with some difficulty since their strengths are about 10−610−6 to 10−810−8 less than the Earth’s magnetic field. Recording of the heart’s magnetic field as it beats is called a magnetocardiogram (MCG), while measurements of the brain’s magnetic field is called a magnetoencephalogram (MEG). Both give information that differs from that obtained by measuring the electric fields of these organs (ECGs and EEGs), but they are not yet of sufficient importance to make these difficult measurements common. 10−610−6 10−810−8 magnetocardiogram (MCG) magnetoencephalogram (MEG) In both of these techniques, the sensors do not touch the body. MCG can be used in fetal studies, and is probably more sensitive than echocardiography. MCG also looks at the heart’s electrical activity whose voltage output is too small to be recorded by surface electrodes as in EKG. It has the potential of being a rapid scan for early diagnosis of cardiac ischemia (obstruction of blood flow to the heart) or problems with the fetus. MEG can be used to identify abnormal electrical discharges in the brain that produce weak magnetic signals. Therefore, it looks at brain activity, not just brain structure. It has been used for studies of Alzheimer’s disease and epilepsy. Advances in instrumentation to measure very small magnetic fields have allowed these two techniques to be used more in recent years. What is used is a sensor called a SQUID, for superconducting quantum interference device. This operates at liquid helium temperatures and can measure magnetic fields thousands of times smaller than the Earth’s. Finally, there is a burgeoning market for magnetic cures in which magnets are applied in a variety of ways to the body, from magnetic bracelets to magnetic mattresses. The best that can be said for such practices is that they are apparently harmless, unless the magnets get close to the patient’s computer or magnetic storage disks. Claims are made for a broad spectrum of benefits from cleansing the blood to giving the patient more energy, but clinical studies have not verified these claims, nor is there an identifiable mechanism by which such benefits might occur.

Page 268,"Faraday’s experiments showed that the emf induced by a change in magnetic flux depends on only a few factors. First, emf is directly proportional to the change in flux ΔΦΔΦ. Second, emf  is greatest when the change in time ΔtΔt is smallest—that is, emf  is inversely proportional to ΔtΔt. Finally, if a coil has 
N
N  turns, an emf will be produced that is NN times greater than for a single coil, so that emf  is directly proportional to NN. The equation for the emf induced by a change in magnetic flux is ΔΦΔΦ ΔtΔt ΔtΔt N
N NN NN 23.2 This relationship is known as Faraday’s law of induction. The units for emf are volts, as is usual. Faraday’s law of induction The minus sign in Faraday’s law of induction is very important. The minus means that the emf creates a current I and magnetic field B that oppose the change in flux ΔΦΔΦ—this is known as Lenz’s law. The direction (given by the minus sign) of the emfis so important that it is called Lenz’s law after the Russian Heinrich Lenz (1804–1865), who, like Faraday and Henry,independently investigated aspects of induction. Faraday was aware of the direction, but Lenz stated it so clearly that he is credited for its discovery. (See Figure 23.7.) ΔΦΔΦ Lenz’s law Figure 23.7 (a) When this bar magnet is thrust into the coil, the strength of the magnetic field increases in the coil. The current induced in the coil creates another field, in the opposite direction of the bar magnet’s to oppose the increase. This is one aspect of Lenz’s law—induction opposes any change in flux. (b) and (c) are two other situations. Verify for yourself that the direction of the induced BcoilBcoil shown indeed opposes the change in flux and that the current direction shown is consistent with RHR-2. Problem-Solving Strategy for Lenz’s Law To use Lenz’s law to determine the directions of the induced magnetic fields, currents, and emfs: For practice, apply these steps to the situations shown in Figure 23.7 and to others that are part of the following text material."
Page 268,"To use Lenz’s law to determine the directions of the induced magnetic fields, currents, and emfs:"
Page 268,"There are many applications of Faraday’s Law of induction, as we will explore in this chapter and others. At this juncture, let us mention several that have to do with data storage and magnetic fields. A very important application has to do with audio and video recording tapes. A plastic tape, coated with iron oxide, moves past a recording head. This recording head is basically a round iron ring about which is wrapped a coil of wire—an electromagnet (Figure 23.8). A signal in the form of a varying input current from a microphone or camera goes to the recording head. These signals (which are a function of the signal amplitude and frequency) produce varying magnetic fields at the recording head. As the tape moves past the recording head, the magnetic field orientations of the iron oxide molecules on the tape are changed thus recording the signal. In the playback mode, the magnetized tape is run past another head, similar in structure to the recording head. The different magnetic field orientations of the iron oxide molecules on the tape induces an emf in the coil of wire in the playback head. This signal then is sent to a loudspeaker or video player. Figure 23.8 Recording and playback heads used with audio and video magnetic tapes. (credit: Steve Jurvetson) Similar principles apply to computer hard drives, except at a much faster rate. Here recordings are on a coated, spinning disk. Read heads historically were made to work on the principle of induction. However, the input information is carried in digital rather than analog form – a series of 0’s or 1’s are written upon the spinning hard drive. Today, most hard drive readout devices do not work on the principle of induction, but use a technique known as giant magnetoresistance. (The discovery that weak changes in a magnetic field in a thin film of iron and chromium could bring about much larger changes in electrical resistance was one of the first large successes of nanotechnology.) Another application of induction is found on the magnetic stripe on the back of your personal credit card as used at the grocery store or the ATM machine. This works on the same principle as the audio or video tape mentioned in the last paragraph in which a head reads personal information from your card. Another application of electromagnetic induction is when electrical signals need to be transmitted across a barrier. Consider the cochlear implant shown below. Sound is picked up by a microphone on the outside of the skull and is used to set up a varying magnetic field. A current is induced in a receiver secured in the bone beneath the skin and transmitted to electrodes in the inner ear. Electromagnetic induction can be used in other instances where electric signals need to be conveyed across various media. Figure 23.9 Electromagnetic induction used in transmitting electric currents across mediums. The device on the baby’s head induces an electrical current in a receiver secured in the bone beneath the skin. (credit: Bjorn Knetsch) Another contemporary area of research in which electromagnetic induction is being successfully implemented (and with substantial potential) is transcranial magnetic simulation. A host of disorders, including depression and hallucinations can be traced to irregular localized electrical activity in the brain. In transcranial magnetic stimulation, a rapidly varying and very localized magnetic field is placed close to certain sites identified in the brain. Weak electric currents are induced in the identified sites and can result in recovery of electrical functioning in the brain tissue. Sleep apnea (“the cessation of breath”) affects both adults and infants (especially premature babies and it may be a cause of sudden infant deaths [SID]). In such individuals, breath can stop repeatedly during their sleep. A cessation of more than 20 seconds can be very dangerous. Stroke, heart failure, and tiredness are just some of the possible consequences for a person having sleep apnea. The concern in infants is the stopping of breath for these longer times. One type of monitor to alert parents when a child is not breathing uses electromagnetic induction. A wire wrapped around the infant’s chest has an alternating current running through it. The expansion and contraction of the infant’s chest as the infant breathes changes the area through the coil. A pickup coil located nearby has an alternating current induced in it due to the changing magnetic field of the initial wire. If the child stops breathing, there will be a change in the induced current, and so a parent can be alerted. Making Connections: Conservation of Energy Lenz’s law is a manifestation of the conservation of energy. The induced emf produces a current that opposes the change in flux, because a change in flux means a change in energy. Energy can enter or leave, but not instantaneously. Lenz’s law is a consequence. As the change begins, the law says induction opposes and, thus, slows the change. In fact, if the induced emf were in the same direction as the change in flux, there would be a positive feedback that would give us free energy from no apparent source—conservation of energy would be violated. Example 23.1 Calculate the magnitude of the induced emf when the magnet in Figure 23.7(a) is thrust into the coil, given the following information: the single loop coil has a radius of 6.00 cm and the average value of BcosθBcosθ (this is given, since the bar magnet’s field is complex) increases from 0.0500 T to 0.250 T in 0.100 s. BcosθBcosθ To find the magnitude of emf, we use Faraday’s law of induction as stated by emf=−NΔΦΔtemf=−NΔΦΔt, but without the minus sign that indicates direction: emf=−NΔΦΔtemf=−NΔΦΔt 23.3 We are given that N=1N=1 and Δt=0.100sΔt=0.100s, but we must determine the change in flux ΔΦΔΦ before we can find emf. Since the area of the loop is fixed, we see that N=1N=1 Δt=0.100sΔt=0.100s ΔΦΔΦ 23.4 Now Δ(Bcosθ)=0.200 TΔ(Bcosθ)=0.200 T, since it was given that BcosθBcosθ changes from 0.0500 to 0.250 T. The area of the loop is A=πr2=(3.14...)(0.060 m)2=1.13×10−2m2A=πr2=(3.14...)(0.060 m)2=1.13×10−2m2. Thus, Δ(Bcosθ)=0.200 TΔ(Bcosθ)=0.200 T BcosθBcosθ A=πr2=(3.14...)(0.060 m)2=1.13×10−2m2A=πr2=(3.14...)(0.060 m)2=1.13×10−2m2 23.5 Entering the determined values into the expression for emf gives 23.6 While this is an easily measured voltage, it is certainly not large enough for most practical applications. More loops in the coil, a stronger magnet, and faster movement make induction the practical source of voltages that it is."

Page 269,"There are many connections between the electric force and the magnetic force. The fact that a moving electric field produces a magnetic field and, conversely, a moving magnetic field produces an electric field is part of why electric and magnetic forces are now considered to be different manifestations of the same force. This classic unification of electric and magnetic forces into what is called the electromagnetic force is the inspiration for contemporary efforts to unify other basic forces."

Page 270,"As discussed in Motional Emf, motional emf is induced when a conductor moves in a magnetic field or when a magnetic field moves relative to a conductor. If motional emf can cause a current loop in the conductor, we refer to that current as an eddy current. Eddy currents can produce significant drag, called magnetic damping, on the motion involved. Consider the apparatus shown in Figure 23.12, which swings a pendulum bob between the poles of a strong magnet. (This is another favorite physics lab activity.) If the bob is metal, there is significant drag on the bob as it enters and leaves the field, quickly damping the motion. If, however, the bob is a slotted metal plate, as shown in Figure 23.12(b), there is a much smaller effect due to the magnet. There is no discernible effect on a bob made of an insulator. Why is there drag in both directions, and are there any uses for magnetic drag? eddy current magnetic damping Figure 23.12 A common physics demonstration device for exploring eddy currents and magnetic damping. (a) The motion of a metal pendulum bob swinging between the poles of a magnet is quickly damped by the action of eddy currents. (b) There is little effect on the motion of a slotted metal bob, implying that eddy currents are made less effective. (c) There is also no magnetic damping on a nonconducting bob, since the eddy currents are extremely small. Figure 23.13 shows what happens to the metal plate as it enters and leaves the magnetic field. In both cases, it experiences a force opposing its motion. As it enters from the left, flux increases, and so an eddy current is set up (Faraday’s law) in the counterclockwise direction (Lenz’s law), as shown. Only the right-hand side of the current loop is in the field, so that there is an unopposed force on it to the left (RHR-1). When the metal plate is completely inside the field, there is no eddy current if the field is uniform, since the flux remains constant in this region. But when the plate leaves the field on the right, flux decreases, causing an eddy current in the clockwise direction that, again, experiences a force to the left, further slowing the motion. A similar analysis of what happens when the plate swings from the right toward the left shows that its motion is also damped when entering and leaving the field. Figure 23.13 A more detailed look at the conducting plate passing between the poles of a magnet. As it enters and leaves the field, the change in flux produces an eddy current. Magnetic force on the current loop opposes the motion. There is no current and no magnetic drag when the plate is completely inside the uniform field. When a slotted metal plate enters the field, as shown in Figure 23.14, an emf is induced by the change in flux, but it is less effective because the slots limit the size of the current loops. Moreover, adjacent loops have currents in opposite directions, and their effects cancel. When an insulating material is used, the eddy current is extremely small, and so magnetic damping on insulators is negligible. If eddy currents are to be avoided in conductors, then they can be slotted or constructed of thin layers of conducting material separated by insulating sheets. Figure 23.14 Eddy currents induced in a slotted metal plate entering a magnetic field form small loops, and the forces on them tend to cancel, thereby making magnetic drag almost zero."
Page 270,"One use of magnetic damping is found in sensitive laboratory balances. To have maximum sensitivity and accuracy, the balance must be as friction-free as possible. But if it is friction-free, then it will oscillate for a very long time. Magnetic damping is a simple and ideal solution. With magnetic damping, drag is proportional to speed and becomes zero at zero velocity. Thus the oscillations are quickly damped, after which the damping force disappears, allowing the balance to be very sensitive. (See Figure 23.15.) In most balances, magnetic damping is accomplished with a conducting disc that rotates in a fixed field. Figure 23.15 Magnetic damping of this sensitive balance slows its oscillations. Since Faraday’s law of induction gives the greatest effect for the most rapid change, damping is greatest for large oscillations and goes to zero as the motion stops. Since eddy currents and magnetic damping occur only in conductors, recycling centers can use magnets to separate metals from other materials. Trash is dumped in batches down a ramp, beneath which lies a powerful magnet. Conductors in the trash are slowed by magnetic damping while nonmetals in the trash move on, separating from the metals. (See Figure 23.16.) This works for all metals, not just ferromagnetic ones. A magnet can separate out the ferromagnetic materials alone by acting on stationary trash. Figure 23.16 Metals can be separated from other trash by magnetic drag. Eddy currents and magnetic drag are created in the metals sent down this ramp by the powerful magnet beneath it. Nonmetals move on. Other major applications of eddy currents are in metal detectors and braking systems in trains and roller coasters. Portable metal detectors (Figure 23.17) consist of a primary coil carrying an alternating current and a secondary coil in which a current is induced. An eddy current will be induced in a piece of metal close to the detector which will cause a change in the induced current within the secondary coil, leading to some sort of signal like a shrill noise. Braking using eddy currents is safer because factors such as rain do not affect the braking and the braking is smoother. However, eddy currents cannot bring the motion to a complete stop, since the force produced decreases with speed. Thus, speed can be reduced from say 20 m/s to 5 m/s, but another form of braking is needed to completely stop the vehicle. Generally, powerful rare earth magnets such as neodymium magnets are used in roller coasters. Figure 23.18 shows rows of magnets in such an application. The vehicle has metal fins (normally containing copper) which pass through the magnetic field slowing the vehicle down in much the same way as with the pendulum bob shown in Figure 23.12. Figure 23.17 A soldier uses a metal detector to search for explosives and weapons. (credit: U.S. Army) Figure 23.18 The rows of rare earth magnets (protruding horizontally) are used for magnetic braking in roller coasters. (credit: Stefan Scheer, Wikimedia Commons) Induction cooktops have electromagnets under their surface. The magnetic field is varied rapidly producing eddy currents in the base of the pot, causing the pot and its contents to increase in temperature. Induction cooktops have high efficiencies and good response times but the base of the pot needs to be ferromagnetic, iron or steel for induction to work."

Page 275,"Induction is the process in which an emf is induced by changing magnetic flux. Many examples have been discussed so far, some more effective than others. Transformers, for example, are designed to be particularly effective at inducing a desired voltage and current with very little loss of energy to other forms. Is there a useful physical quantity related to how “effective” a given device is? The answer is yes, and that physical quantity is called inductance. inductance Mutual inductance is the effect of Faraday’s law of induction for one device upon another, such as the primary coil in transmitting energy to the secondary in a transformer. See Figure 23.37, where simple coils induce emfs in one another. Mutual inductance Figure 23.37 These coils can induce emfs in one another like an inefficient transformer. Their mutual inductance M indicates the effectiveness of the coupling between them. Here a change in current in coil 1 is seen to induce an emf in coil 2. (Note that ""

     induced"" represents the induced emf in coil 2.) In the many cases where the geometry of the devices is fixed, flux is changed by varying current. We therefore concentrate on the rate of change of current, ΔI/ΔtΔI/Δt, as the cause of induction. A change in the current I1I1 in one device, coil 1 in the figure, induces an emf2emf2 in the other. We express this in equation form as ΔI/ΔtΔI/Δt I1I1 emf2emf2 23.34 where MM is defined to be the mutual inductance between the two devices. The minus sign is an expression of Lenz’s law. The larger the mutual inductance MM, the more effective the coupling. For example, the coils in Figure 23.37 have a small MM compared with the transformer coils in Figure 23.27. Units for MM are (V⋅s)/A=Ω⋅s(V⋅s)/A=Ω⋅s, which is named a henry (H), after Joseph Henry. That is, 1 H=1Ω⋅s1 H=1Ω⋅s. MM MM MM MM (V⋅s)/A=Ω⋅s(V⋅s)/A=Ω⋅s henry 1 H=1Ω⋅s1 H=1Ω⋅s Nature is symmetric here. If we change the current I2I2 in coil 2, we induce an emf1emf1 in coil 1, which is given by I2I2 emf1emf1 23.35 where MM is the same as for the reverse process. Transformers run backward with the same effectiveness, or mutual inductance MM. MM MM A large mutual inductance MM may or may not be desirable. We want a transformer to have a large mutual inductance. But an appliance, such as an electric clothes dryer, can induce a dangerous emf on its case if the mutual inductance between its coils and the case is large. One way to reduce mutual inductance MM is to counterwind coils to cancel the magnetic field produced. (See Figure 23.38.) MM MM Figure 23.38 The heating coils of an electric clothes dryer can be counter-wound so that their magnetic fields cancel one another, greatly reducing the mutual inductance with the case of the dryer. Self-inductance, the effect of Faraday’s law of induction of a device on itself, also exists. When, for example, current through a coil is increased, the magnetic field and flux also increase, inducing a counter emf, as required by Lenz’s law. Conversely, if the current is decreased, an emf is induced that opposes the decrease. Most devices have a fixed geometry, and so the change in flux is due entirely to the change in current ΔIΔI through the device. The induced emf is related to the physical geometry of the device and the rate of change of current. It is given by Self-inductance ΔIΔI 23.36 where LL is the self-inductance of the device. A device that exhibits significant self-inductance is called an inductor, and given the symbol in Figure 23.39. LL inductor Figure 23.39 The minus sign is an expression of Lenz’s law, indicating that emf opposes the change in current. Units of self-inductance are henries (H) just as for mutual inductance. The larger the self-inductance LL of a device, the greater its opposition to any change in current through it. For example, a large coil with many turns and an iron core has a large LL and will not allow current to change quickly. To avoid this effect, a small LL must be achieved, such as by counterwinding coils as in Figure 23.38. LL LL LL A 1 H inductor is a large inductor. To illustrate this, consider a device with L=1.0 HL=1.0 H that has a 10 A current flowing through it. What happens if we try to shut off the current rapidly, perhaps in only 1.0 ms? An emf, given by emf=−L(ΔI/Δt)emf=−L(ΔI/Δt), will oppose the change. Thus an emf will be induced given by emf=−L(ΔI/Δt)=(1.0 H)[(10 A)/(1.0 ms)]=10,000 Vemf=−L(ΔI/Δt)=(1.0 H)[(10 A)/(1.0 ms)]=10,000 V. The positive sign means this large voltage is in the same direction as the current, opposing its decrease. Such large emfs can cause arcs, damaging switching equipment, and so it may be necessary to change current more slowly. L=1.0 HL=1.0 H emf=−L(ΔI/Δt)emf=−L(ΔI/Δt) emf=−L(ΔI/Δt)=(1.0 H)[(10 A)/(1.0 ms)]=10,000 Vemf=−L(ΔI/Δt)=(1.0 H)[(10 A)/(1.0 ms)]=10,000 V There are uses for such a large induced voltage. Camera flashes use a battery, two inductors that function as a transformer, and a switching system or oscillator to induce large voltages. (Remember that we need a changing magnetic field, brought about by a changing current, to induce a voltage in another coil.) The oscillator system will do this many times as the battery voltage is boosted to over one thousand volts. (You may hear the high pitched whine from the transformer as the capacitor is being charged.) A capacitor stores the high voltage for later use in powering the flash. (See Figure 23.40.) Figure 23.40 Through rapid switching of an inductor, 1.5 V batteries can be used to induce emfs of several thousand volts. This voltage can be used to store charge in a capacitor for later use, such as in a camera flash attachment. It is possible to calculate LL for an inductor given its geometry (size and shape) and knowing the magnetic field that it produces. This is difficult in most cases, because of the complexity of the field created. So in this text the inductance LL is usually a given quantity. One exception is the solenoid, because it has a very uniform field inside, a nearly zero field outside, and a simple shape. It is instructive to derive an equation for its inductance. We start by noting that the induced emf is given by Faraday’s law of induction as emf=−N(ΔΦ/Δt)emf=−N(ΔΦ/Δt) and, by the definition of self-inductance, as emf=−L(ΔI/Δt)emf=−L(ΔI/Δt). Equating these yields LL LL emf=−N(ΔΦ/Δt)emf=−N(ΔΦ/Δt) emf=−L(ΔI/Δt)emf=−L(ΔI/Δt) 23.37 Solving for LL gives LL 23.38 This equation for the self-inductance LL of a device is always valid. It means that self-inductance LL depends on how effective the current is in creating flux; the more effective, the greater ΔΦΔΦ/ ΔIΔI is. LL LL ΔΦΔΦ ΔIΔI Let us use this last equation to find an expression for the inductance of a solenoid. Since the area

One common application of inductance is used in traffic lights that can tell when vehicles are waiting at the intersection. An electrical circuit with an inductor is placed in the road under the place a waiting car will stop over. The body of the car increases the inductance and the circuit changes sending a signal to the traffic lights to change colors. Similarly, metal detectors used for airport security employ the same technique. A coil or inductor in the metal detector frame acts as both a transmitter and a receiver. The pulsed signal in the transmitter coil induces a signal in the receiver. The self-inductance of the circuit is affected by any metal object in the path. Such detectors can be adjusted for sensitivity and also can indicate the approximate location of metal found on a person. See Figure 23.41.

Page 275,"We know from Lenz’s law that inductances oppose changes in current. There is an alternative way to look at this opposition that is based on energy. Energy is stored in a magnetic field. It takes time to build up energy, and it also takes time to deplete energy; hence, there is an opposition to rapid change. In an inductor, the magnetic field is directly proportional to current and to the inductance of the device. It can be shown that the energy stored in an inductor EindEind is given by energy stored in an inductor EindEind 23.43 This expression is similar to that for the energy stored in a capacitor. Example 23.8 How much energy is stored in the 0.632 mH inductor of the preceding example when a 30.0 A current flows through it? The energy is given by the equation Eind=12LI2Eind=12LI2, and all quantities except EindEind are known. Eind=12LI2Eind=12LI2 EindEind Substituting the value for LL found in the previous example and the given current into Eind=12LI2Eind=12LI2 gives LL Eind=12LI2Eind=12LI2 23.44 This amount of energy is certainly enough to cause a spark if the current is suddenly switched off.

The coil will be very close to its full current in about ten time constants, or about 25 ms. We can find the current by using I=I0e−t/τI=I0e−t/τ, or by considering the decline in steps. Since the time is twice the characteristic time, we consider the process in steps. I=I0e−t/τI=I0e−t/τ In the first 2.50 ms, the current declines to 0.368 of its initial value, which is 23.49 After another 2.50 ms, or a total of 5.00 ms, the current declines to 0.368 of the value just found.

Page 277,"Suppose an inductor is connected directly to an AC voltage source, as shown in Figure 23.43. It is reasonable to assume negligible resistance, since in practice we can make the resistance of an inductor so small that it has a negligible effect on the circuit. Also shown is a graph of voltage and current as functions of time. Figure 23.43 (a) An AC voltage source in series with an inductor having negligible resistance. (b) Graph of current and voltage across the inductor as functions of time. The graph in Figure 23.43(b) starts with voltage at a maximum. Note that the current starts at zero and rises to its peak after the voltage that drives it, just as was the case when DC voltage was switched on in the preceding section. When the voltage becomes negative at point a, the current begins to decrease; it becomes zero at point b, where voltage is its most negative. The current then becomes negative, again following the voltage. The voltage becomes positive at point c and begins to make the current less negative. At point d, the current goes through zero just as the voltage reaches its positive peak to start another cycle.

V XLXL 23.52 with ff the frequency of the AC voltage source in hertz (An analysis of the circuit using Kirchhoff’s loop rule and calculus actually produces this expression). XLXL is called the inductive reactance, because the inductor reacts to impede the current. XLXL has units of ohms (1 H=1 Ω⋅s1 H=1 Ω⋅s, so that frequency times inductance has units of (cycles/s)(Ω⋅s)=Ω(cycles/s)(Ω⋅s)=Ω), consistent with its role as an effective resistance. It makes sense that XLXL is proportional to LL, since the greater the induction the greater its resistance to change. It is also reasonable that XLXL is proportional to frequency ff, since greater frequency means greater change in current. That is, ΔI/ΔtΔI/Δt is large for large frequencies (large ff, small ΔtΔt). The greater the change, the greater the opposition of an inductor. ff XLXL inductive reactance XLXL 1 H=1 Ω⋅s1 H=1 Ω⋅s (cycles/s)(Ω⋅s)=Ω(cycles/s)(Ω⋅s)=Ω XLXL LL XLXL ff ΔI/ΔtΔI/Δt ff ΔtΔt Example 23.10 (a) Calculate the inductive reactance of a 3.00 mH inductor when 60.0 Hz and 10.0 kHz AC voltages are applied. (b) What is the rms current at each frequency if the applied rms voltage is 120 V? The inductive reactance is found directly from the expression XL=2πfLXL=2πfL. Once XLXL has been found at each frequency, Ohm’s law as stated in the Equation I=V/XLI=V/XL can be used to find the current at each frequency. XL=2πfLXL=2πfL XLXL I=V/XLI=V/XL Entering the frequency and inductance into Equation XL=2πfLXL=2πfL gives XL=2πfLXL=2πfL 23.53 Similarly, at 10 kHz, 23.54 The rms current is now found using the version of Ohm’s law in Equation I=V/XLI=V/XL, given the applied rms voltage is 120 V. For the first frequency, this yields I=V/XLI=V/XL 23.55 Similarly, at 10 kHz, 23.56 The inductor reacts very differently at the two different frequencies. At the higher frequency, its reactance is large and the current is small, consistent with how an inductor impedes rapid change. Thus high frequencies are impeded the most. Inductors can be used to filter out high frequencies; for example, a large inductor can be put in series with a sound reproduction system or in series with your home computer to reduce high-frequency sound output from your speakers or high-frequency power spikes into your computer. Note that although the resistance in the circuit considered is negligible, the AC current is not extremely large because inductive reactance impedes its flow. With AC, there is no time for the current to become extremely large."

Page 277,"Consider the capacitor connected directly to an AC voltage source as shown in Figure 23.44. The resistance of a circuit like this can be made so small that it has a negligible effect compared with the capacitor, and so we can assume negligible resistance. Voltage across the capacitor and current are graphed as functions of time in the figure. Figure 23.44 (a) An AC voltage source in series with a capacitor C having negligible resistance. (b) Graph of current and voltage across the capacitor as functions of time. The graph in Figure 23.44 starts with voltage across the capacitor at a maximum. The current is zero at this point, because the capacitor is fully charged and halts the flow. Then voltage drops and the current becomes negative as the capacitor discharges. At point a, the capacitor has fully discharged (Q=0Q=0 on it) and the voltage across it is zero. The current remains negative between points a and b, causing the voltage on the capacitor to reverse. This is complete at point b, where the current is zero and the voltage has its most negative value. The current becomes positive after point b, neutralizing the charge on the capacitor and bringing the voltage to zero at point c, which allows the current to reach its maximum. Between points c and d, the current drops to zero as the voltage rises to its peak, and the process starts to repeat.

XCXC has units of ohms (verification left as an exercise for the reader). XCXC is inversely proportional to the capacitance CC; the larger the capacitor, the greater the charge it can store and the greater the current that can flow.

For the first frequency, this yields I=V/XCI=V/XC 23.61 Similarly, at 10 kHz, 23.62 The capacitor reacts very differently at the two different frequencies, and in exactly the opposite way an inductor reacts. At the higher frequency, its reactance is small and the current is large. Capacitors favor change, whereas inductors oppose change. Capacitors impede low frequencies the most, since low frequency allows them time to become charged and stop the current. Capacitors can be used to filter out low frequencies. For example, a capacitor in series with a sound reproduction system rids it of the 60 Hz hum. Although a capacitor is basically an open circuit, there is an rms current in a circuit with an AC voltage applied to a capacitor. This is because the voltage is continually reversing, charging and discharging the capacitor. If the frequency goes to zero (DC), XCXC tends to infinity, and the current is zero once the capacitor is charged. At very high frequencies, the capacitor’s reactance tends to zero—it has a negligible reactance and does not impede the current (it acts like a simple wire). Capacitors have the opposite effect on AC circuits that inductors have. XCXC"

Figure 23.46 shows an RLC series circuit with an AC voltage source, the behavior of which is the subject of this section.

Figure 23.47 shows these relationships in one graph, as well as showing the total voltage around the circuit V=VR+VL+VCV=VR+VL+VC, where all four voltages are the instantaneous values. According to Kirchhoff’s loop rule, the total voltage around the circuit

90º. Thus VLVL and VCVC are 
180º
180º out of phase (crest to trough) and tend to cancel, although not completely unless they have the same magnitude. Since the peak voltages are not aligned (not in phase), the peak voltage V0V0 of the source does not equal the sum of the peak voltages across RR, LL, and CC. The actual relationship is VRVR VLVL 90º

At some intermediate frequency f0f0, the reactances will be equal and cancel, giving Z=RZ=R —this is a minimum value for impedance, and a maximum value for IrmsIrms results. We can get an expression for f0f0 by taking XLXL XCXC f0f0 Z=RZ=R IrmsIrms f0f0 23.70 Substituting the definitions of XLXL and XCXC, XLXL XCXC 23.71 Solving this expression for f0f0 yields f0f0 23.72 where f0f0 is the resonant frequency of an RLC series circuit. This is also the natural frequency at which the circuit would oscillate if not driven by the voltage source. At f0f0, the effects of the inductor and capacitor cancel, so that Z=RZ=R, and IrmsIrms is a maximum. f0f0 resonant frequency f0f0 Z=RZ=R IrmsIrms Resonance in AC circuits is analogous to mechanical resonance, where resonance is defined to be a forced oscillation—in this case, forced by the voltage source—at the natural frequency of the system. The receiver in a radio is an RLC circuit that oscillates best at its f0f0. A variable capacitor is often used to adjust f0f0 to receive a desired frequency and to reject others. Figure 23.48 is a graph of current as a function of frequency, illustrating a resonant peak in IrmsIrms at f0f0. The two curves are for two different circuits, which differ only in the amount of resistance in them. The peak is lower and broader for the higher-resistance circuit. Thus the higher-resistance circuit does not resonate as strongly and would not be as selective in a radio receiver, for example. f0f0 f0f0 IrmsIrms f0f0 Figure 23.48 A graph of current versus frequency for two RLC series circuits differing only in the amount of resistance.

This was to be expected, since the capacitor dominated at the low frequency and the inductor dominated at the high frequency. Their effects are the same at this intermediate frequency. The current is given by Ohm’s law. At resonance, the two reactances are equal and cancel, so that the impedance equals the resistance alone. Thus, 23.74 At resonance, the current is greater than at the higher and lower frequencies considered for the same circuit in the preceding example."
Page 278,"If current varies with frequency in an RLC circuit, then the power delivered to it also varies with frequency. But the average power is not simply current times voltage, as it is in purely resistive circuits. As was seen in Figure 23.47, voltage and current are out of phase in an RLC circuit. There is a phase angle ϕϕ between the source voltage VV and the current II, which can be found from phase angle ϕϕ VV II 23.75 For example, at the resonant frequency or in a purely resistive circuit Z=RZ=R, so that cosϕ=1cosϕ=1. This implies that ϕ=0ºϕ=0º and that voltage and current are in phase, as expected for resistors. At other frequencies, average power is less than at resonance. This is both because voltage and current are out of phase and because IrmsIrms is lower. The fact that source voltage and current are out of phase affects the power delivered to the circuit. It can be shown that the average power is Z=RZ=R cosϕ=1cosϕ=1 ϕ=0ºϕ=0º IrmsIrms 23.76 Thus cosϕcosϕ is called the power factor, which can range from 0 to 1. Power factors near 1 are desirable when designing an efficient motor, for example.

Power delivered to an RLC series AC circuit is dissipated by the resistance alone. The inductor and capacitor have energy input and output but do not dissipate it out of the circuit. Rather they transfer energy back and forth to one another, with the resistor dissipating exactly what the voltage source puts into the circuit. This assumes no significant electromagnetic radiation from the inductor and capacitor, such as radio waves. Such radiation can happen and may even be desired, as we will see in the next chapter on electromagnetic radiation, but it can also be suppressed as is the case in this chapter. The circuit is analogous to the wheel of a car driven over a corrugated road as shown in Figure 23.49. The regularly spaced bumps in the road are analogous to the voltage source, driving the wheel up and down. The shock absorber is analogous to the resistance damping and limiting the amplitude of the oscillation. Energy within the system goes back and forth between kinetic (analogous to maximum current, and energy stored in an inductor) and potential energy stored in the car spring (analogous to no current, and energy stored in the electric field of a capacitor). The amplitude of the wheels’ motion is a maximum if the bumps in the road are hit at the resonant frequency. Figure 23.49 The forced but damped motion of the wheel on the car spring is analogous to an RLC series AC circuit. The shock absorber damps the motion and dissipates energy, analogous to the resistance in an RLC circuit. The mass and spring determine the resonant frequency. A pure LC circuit with negligible resistance oscillates at f0f0, the same resonant frequency as an RLC circuit. It can serve as a frequency standard or clock circuit—for example, in a digital wristwatch. With a very small resistance, only a very small energy input is necessary to maintain the oscillations. The circuit is analogous to a car with no shock absorbers. Once it starts oscillating, it continues at its natural frequency for some time. Figure 23.50 shows the analogy between an LC circuit and a mass on a spring. f0f0 Figure 23.50 An LC circuit is analogous to a mass oscillating on a spring with no friction and no driving force. Energy moves back and forth between the inductor and capacitor, just as it moves from kinetic to potential in the mass-spring system."

Page 283,"Many people confuse sound waves with radio waves, one type of electromagnetic (EM) wave. However, sound and radio waves are completely different phenomena. Sound creates pressure variations (waves) in matter, such as air or water, or your eardrum. Conversely, radio waves are electromagnetic waves, like visible light, infrared, ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays. EM waves don’t need a medium in which to propagate; they can travel through a vacuum, such as outer space. radio waves A radio works because sound waves played by the D.J. at the radio station are converted into electromagnetic waves, then encoded and transmitted in the radio-frequency range. The radio in your car receives the radio waves, decodes the information, and uses a speaker to change it back into a sound wave, bringing sweet music to your ears."
Page 283,"It is worth noting at the outset that the general phenomenon of electromagnetic waves was predicted by theory before it was realized that light is a form of electromagnetic wave. The prediction was made by James Clerk Maxwell in the mid-19th century when he formulated a single theory combining all the electric and magnetic effects known by scientists at that time. “Electromagnetic waves” was the name he gave to the phenomena his theory predicted. Such a theoretical prediction followed by experimental verification is an indication of the power of science in general, and physics in particular. The underlying connections and unity of physics allow certain great minds to solve puzzles without having all the pieces. The prediction of electromagnetic waves is one of the most spectacular examples of this power. Certain others, such as the prediction of antimatter, will be discussed in later modules. Figure 24.2 The electromagnetic waves sent and received by this 50-foot radar dish antenna at Kennedy Space Center in Florida are not visible, but help track expendable launch vehicles with high-definition imagery. The first use of this C-band radar dish was for the launch of the Atlas V rocket sending the New Horizons probe toward Pluto. (credit: NASA)"

Page 284,"The German physicist Heinrich Hertz (1857–1894) was the first to generate and detect certain types of electromagnetic waves in the laboratory. Starting in 1887, he performed a series of experiments that not only confirmed the existence of electromagnetic waves, but also verified that they travel at the speed of light. Hertz used an AC RLCRLC (resistor-inductor-capacitor) circuit that resonates at a known frequency f0=12πLCf0=12πLC and connected it to a loop of wire as shown in Figure 24.4. High voltages induced across the gap in the loop produced sparks that were visible evidence of the current in the circuit and that helped generate electromagnetic waves. RLCRLC f0=12πLCf0=12πLC Across the laboratory, Hertz had another loop attached to another RLCRLC circuit, which could be tuned (as the dial on a radio) to the same resonant frequency as the first and could, thus, be made to receive electromagnetic waves. This loop also had a gap across which sparks were generated, giving solid evidence that electromagnetic waves had been received. RLCRLC Figure 24.4 The apparatus used by Hertz in 1887 to generate and detect electromagnetic waves. An RLCRLC circuit connected to the first loop caused sparks across a gap in the wire loop and generated electromagnetic waves. Sparks across a gap in the second loop located across the laboratory gave evidence that the waves had been received. Hertz also studied the reflection, refraction, and interference patterns of the electromagnetic waves he generated, verifying their wave character. He was able to determine wavelength from the interference patterns, and knowing their frequency, he could calculate the propagation speed using the equation υ=fλυ=fλ (velocity—or speed—equals frequency times wavelength). Hertz was thus able to prove that electromagnetic waves travel at the speed of light. The SI unit for frequency, the hertz (1 Hz= 1 cycle/s1 Hz= 1 cycle/s), is named in his honor. υ=fλυ=fλ 1 Hz= 1 cycle/s1 Hz= 1 cycle/s"

Page 285,"Following Ampere’s law, current in the antenna produces a magnetic field, as shown in Figure 24.6. The relationship between EE and BB is shown at one instant in Figure 24.6 (a). As the current varies, the magnetic field varies in magnitude and direction. EE BB Figure 24.6 (a) The current in the antenna produces the circular magnetic field lines. The current (II) produces the separation of charge along the wire, which in turn creates the electric field as shown. (b) The electric and magnetic fields (EE and BB) near the wire are perpendicular; they are shown here for one point in space. (c) The magnetic field varies with current and propagates away from the antenna at the speed of light. The magnetic field lines also propagate away from the antenna at the speed of light, forming the other part of the electromagnetic wave, as seen in Figure 24.6 (b). The magnetic part of the wave has the same period and wavelength as the electric part, since they are both produced by the same movement and separation of charges in the antenna. The electric and magnetic waves are shown together at one instant in time in Figure 24.7. The electric and magnetic fields produced by a long straight wire antenna are exactly in phase. Note that they are perpendicular to one another and to the direction of propagation, making this a transverse wave. transverse wave Figure 24.7 A part of the electromagnetic wave sent out from the antenna at one instant in time. The electric and magnetic fields (EE and BB) are in phase, and they are perpendicular to one another and the direction of propagation. For clarity, the waves are shown only along one direction, but they propagate out in other directions too. Electromagnetic waves generally propagate out from a source in all directions, sometimes forming a complex radiation pattern. A linear antenna like this one will not radiate parallel to its length, for example. The wave is shown in one direction from the antenna in Figure 24.7 to illustrate its basic characteristics. Instead of the AC generator, the antenna can also be driven by an AC circuit. In fact, charges radiate whenever they are accelerated. But while a current in a circuit needs a complete path, an antenna has a varying charge distribution forming a standing wave, driven by the AC. The dimensions of the antenna are critical for determining the frequency of the radiated electromagnetic waves. This is a resonant phenomenon and when we tune radios or TV, we vary electrical properties to achieve appropriate resonant conditions in the antenna. standing wave resonant"
Page 285,"Electromagnetic waves carry energy away from their source, similar to a sound wave carrying energy away from a standing wave on a guitar string. An antenna for receiving EM signals works in reverse. And like antennas that produce EM waves, receiver antennas are specially designed to resonate at particular frequencies. An incoming electromagnetic wave accelerates electrons in the antenna, setting up a standing wave. If the radio or TV is switched on, electrical components pick up and amplify the signal formed by the accelerating electrons. The signal is then converted to audio and/or video format. Sometimes big receiver dishes are used to focus the signal onto an antenna. In fact, charges radiate whenever they are accelerated. When designing circuits, we often assume that energy does not quickly escape AC circuits, and mostly this is true. A broadcast antenna is specially designed to enhance the rate of electromagnetic radiation, and shielding is necessary to keep the radiation close to zero. Some familiar phenomena are based on the production of electromagnetic waves by varying currents. Your microwave oven, for example, sends electromagnetic waves, called microwaves, from a concealed antenna that has an oscillating current imposed on it."
Page 285,"There is a relationship between the EE- and BB-field strengths in an electromagnetic wave. This can be understood by again considering the antenna just described. The stronger the EE-field created by a separation of charge, the greater the current and, hence, the greater the BB-field created. EE BB EE BB Since current is directly proportional to voltage (Ohm’s law) and voltage is directly proportional to EE-field strength, the two should be directly proportional. It can be shown that the magnitudes of the fields do have a constant ratio, equal to the speed of light. That is, EE 24.3 is the ratio of EE-field strength to BB-field strength in any electromagnetic wave. This is true at all times and at all locations in space. A simple and elegant result.

BB EE 1000 V/m1000 V/m To find the BB-field strength, we rearrange the above equation to solve for BB, yielding BB BB 24.4 We are given EE, and cc is the speed of light. Entering these into the expression for BB yields EE cc BB 24.5 Where T stands for Tesla, a measure of magnetic field strength. The BB-field strength is less than a tenth of the Earth’s admittedly weak magnetic field. This means that a relatively strong electric field of 1000 V/m is accompanied by a relatively weak magnetic field. Note that as this wave spreads out, say with distance from an antenna, its field strengths become progressively weaker. BB The result of this example is consistent with the statement made in the module Maxwell’s Equations: Electromagnetic Waves Predicted and Observed that changing electric fields create relatively weak magnetic fields. They can be detected in electromagnetic waves, however, by taking advantage of the phenomenon of resonance, as Hertz did. A system with the same natural frequency as the electromagnetic wave can be made to oscillate. All radio and TV receivers use this principle to pick up and then amplify weak electromagnetic waves, while rejecting all others not at their resonant frequency. Take-Home Experiment: Antennas If you own a cell phone or a laptop, use a search engine or the product documentation to identify the type of antenna it contains.

Page 286,"What happens when an electromagnetic wave impinges on a material? If the material is transparent to the particular frequency, then the wave can largely be transmitted. If the material is opaque to the frequency, then the wave can be totally reflected. The wave can also be absorbed by the material, indicating that there is some interaction between the wave and the material, such as the thermal agitation of molecules. Of course it is possible to have partial transmission, reflection, and absorption. We normally associate these properties with visible light, but they do apply to all electromagnetic waves. What is not obvious is that something that is transparent to light may be opaque at other frequencies. For example, ordinary glass is transparent to visible light but largely opaque to ultraviolet radiation. Human skin is opaque to visible light—we cannot see through people—but transparent to X-rays."
Page 286,"The broad category of radio waves is defined to contain any electromagnetic wave produced by currents in wires and circuits. Its name derives from their most common use as a carrier of audio information (i.e., radio). The name is applied to electromagnetic waves of similar frequencies regardless of source. Radio waves from outer space, for example, do not come from alien radio stations. They are created by many astronomical phenomena, and their study has revealed much about nature on the largest scales. radio waves There are many uses for radio waves, and so the category is divided into many subcategories, including microwaves and those electromagnetic waves used for AM and FM radio, cellular telephones, and TV. The lowest commonly encountered radio frequencies are produced by high-voltage AC power transmission lines at frequencies of 50 or 60 Hz. (See Figure 24.9.) These extremely long wavelength electromagnetic waves (about 6000 km!) are one means of energy loss in long-distance power transmission. Figure 24.9 This high-voltage traction power line running to Eutingen Railway Substation in Germany radiates electromagnetic waves with very long wavelengths. (credit: Zonk43, Wikimedia Commons) There was a concern regarding potential health hazards associated with exposure to these electromagnetic fields (EE-fields). Some people suspect that living near such transmission lines may cause a variety of illnesses, including cancer. But these power lines produce non-ionizing radiation, which government environmental organizations, medical researchers, and cancer organizations indicate are not risk factors for illness. Recent reports that have looked at many European and American epidemiological studies have found no increase in risk for cancer due to exposure to EE-fields. EE EE Extremely low frequency (ELF) radio waves of about 1 kHz are used to communicate with submerged submarines. The ability of radio waves to penetrate salt water is related to their wavelength (much like ultrasound penetrating tissue)—the longer the wavelength, the farther they penetrate. Since salt water is a good conductor, radio waves are strongly absorbed by it, and very long wavelengths are needed to reach a submarine under the surface. (See Figure 24.10.) Extremely low frequency (ELF) Figure 24.10 Very long wavelength radio waves are needed to reach this submarine, requiring extremely low frequency signals (ELF). Shorter wavelengths do not penetrate to any significant depth. AM radio waves are used to carry commercial radio signals in the frequency range from 540 to 1600 kHz. The abbreviation AM stands for amplitude modulation, which is the method for placing information on these waves. (See Figure 24.11.) A carrier wave having the basic frequency of the radio station, say 1530 kHz, is varied or modulated in amplitude by an audio signal. The resulting wave has a constant frequency, but a varying amplitude. amplitude modulation carrier wave A radio receiver tuned to have the same resonant frequency as the carrier wave can pick up the signal, while rejecting the many other frequencies impinging on its antenna. The receiver’s circuitry is designed to respond to variations in amplitude of the carrier wave to replicate the original audio signal. That audio signal is amplified to drive a speaker or perhaps to be recorded. Figure 24.11 Amplitude modulation for AM radio. (a) A carrier wave at the station’s basic frequency. (b) An audio signal at much lower audible frequencies. (c) The amplitude of the carrier is modulated by the audio signal without changing its basic frequency."
Page 286,"FM radio waves are also used for commercial radio transmission, but in the frequency range of 88 to 108 MHz. FM stands for frequency modulation, another method of carrying information. (See Figure 24.12.) Here a carrier wave having the basic frequency of the radio station, perhaps 105.1 MHz, is modulated in frequency by the audio signal, producing a wave of constant amplitude but varying frequency. frequency modulation Figure 24.12 Frequency modulation for FM radio. (a) A carrier wave at the station’s basic frequency. (b) An audio signal at much lower audible frequencies. (c) The frequency of the carrier is modulated by the audio signal without changing its amplitude. Since audible frequencies range up to 20 kHz (or 0.020 MHz) at most, the frequency of the FM radio wave can vary from the carrier by as much as 0.020 MHz. Thus the carrier frequencies of two different radio stations cannot be closer than 0.020 MHz. An FM receiver is tuned to resonate at the carrier frequency and has circuitry that responds to variations in frequency, reproducing the audio information. FM radio is inherently less subject to noise from stray radio sources than AM radio. The reason is that amplitudes of waves add. So an AM receiver would interpret noise added onto the amplitude of its carrier wave as part of the information. An FM receiver can be made to reject amplitudes other than that of the basic carrier wave and only look for variations in frequency. It is thus easier to reject noise from FM, since noise produces a variation in amplitude. Television is also broadcast on electromagnetic waves. Since the waves must carry a great deal of visual as well as audio information, each channel requires a larger range of frequencies than simple radio transmission. TV channels utilize frequencies in the range of 54 to 88 MHz and 174 to 222 MHz. (The entire FM radio band lies between channels 88 MHz and 174 MHz.) These TV channels are called VHF (for very high frequency). Other channels called UHF (for ultra high frequency) utilize an even higher frequency range of 470 to 1000 MHz. Television very high frequency ultra high frequency The TV video signal is AM, while the TV audio is FM. Note that these frequencies are those of free transmission with the user utilizing an old-fashioned roof antenna. Satellite dishes and cable transmission of TV occurs at significantly higher frequencies and is rapidly evolving with the use of the high-definition or HD format. Example 24.2 Calculate the wavelengths of a 1530-kHz AM radio signal, a 105.1-MHz FM radio signal, and a 1.90-GHz cell phone signal. The relationship between wavelength and frequency is c=fλc=fλ, where c=3.00×108m/sc=3.00×108m/s is the speed of light (the speed of light is only very slightly smaller in air than it is in a vacuum). We can rearrange this equation to find the wavelength for all three frequencies. c=fλc=fλ c=3.00×108m/sc=3.00×108m/s Rearranging gives 24.7 (a) For the f=1530 kHzf=1530 kHz AM radio signal, then, f=1530 kHzf=1530 kHz 24.8 (b) For the f=105.1 MHzf=105.1 MHz FM radio signal, f=105.1 MHzf=105.1 MHz 24.9 (c) And for the f=1.90 GHzf=1.90 GHz cell phone, f=1.90 GHzf=1.90 GHz 24.10 These wavelengths are consistent with the spectrum in Figure 24.8. The wavelengths are also related to other properties of these electromagnetic waves, as we shall see. The wavelengths found in the preceding example are representative of AM, FM, and cell phones, and account for some of the differences in how they are broadcast and how well they travel. The most efficient length for a linear antenna, such as discussed in Production of Electromagnetic Waves, is λ/2λ/2, half the wavelength of the electromagnetic wave. Thus a very large antenna is needed to efficiently broadcast typical AM radio with its carrier wavelengths on the order of hundreds of meters. λ/2λ/2 One benefit to these long AM wavelengths is that they can go over and around rather large obstacles (like buildings and hills), just as ocean waves can go around large rocks. FM and TV are best received when there is a line of sight between the broadcast antenna and receiver, and they are often sent from very tall structures. FM, TV, and mobile phone antennas themselves are much smaller than those used for AM, but they are elevated to achieve an unobstructed line of sight. (See Figure 24.13.) Figure 24.13 (a) A large tower is used to broadcast TV signals. The actual antennas are small structures on top of the tower—they are placed at great heights to have a clear line of sight over a large broadcast area.

Page 286,"Astronomers and astrophysicists collect signals from outer space using electromagnetic waves. A common problem for astrophysicists is the “pollution” from electromagnetic radiation pervading our surroundings from communication systems in general. Even everyday gadgets like our car keyless entry devices and remote starters and being able to turn TVs on and off using remotes involve radio-wave frequencies. In order to prevent interference between all these electromagnetic signals, strict regulations are drawn up for different organizations to utilize different radio frequency bands. One reason why we are sometimes asked to switch off our mobile phones (operating in the range of 1.9 GHz) or put them into a noncommunicative mode on airplanes and in hospitals is that important communications or medical equipment often uses similar radio frequencies and their operation can be affected by frequencies used in the communication devices. For example, radio waves used in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have frequencies on the order of 100 MHz, although this varies significantly depending on the strength of the magnetic field used and the nuclear type being scanned. MRI is an important medical imaging and research tool, producing highly detailed two- and three-dimensional images. Radio waves are broadcast, absorbed, and reemitted in a resonance process that is sensitive to the density of nuclei (usually protons or hydrogen nuclei). The wavelength of 100-MHz radio waves is 3 m, yet using the sensitivity of the resonant frequency to the magnetic field strength, details smaller than a millimeter can be imaged. This is a good example of an exception to a rule of thumb (in this case, the rubric that details much smaller than the probe’s wavelength cannot be detected). The intensity of the radio waves used in MRI presents little or no hazard to human health."

Microwave frequencies range from about 109Hz109Hz to the highest practical LCLC resonance at nearly 1012Hz1012Hz. Since they have high frequencies, their wavelengths are short compared with those of other radio waves—hence the name “microwave.” Microwaves 109Hz109Hz LCLC 1012Hz1012Hz Microwaves can also be produced by atoms and molecules. They are, for example, a component of electromagnetic radiation generated by thermal agitation. The thermal motion of atoms and molecules in any object at a temperature above absolute zero causes them to emit and absorb radiation. thermal agitation Since it is possible to carry more information per unit time on high frequencies, microwaves are quite suitable for communications. Most satellite-transmitted information is carried on microwaves, as are land-based long-distance transmissions. A clear line of sight between transmitter and receiver is needed because of the short wavelengths involved. Radar is a common application of microwaves that was first developed in World War II. By detecting and timing microwave echoes, radar systems can determine the distance to objects as diverse as clouds and aircraft. A Doppler shift in the radar echo can be used to determine the speed of a car or the intensity of a rainstorm. Sophisticated radar systems are used to map the Earth and other planets, with a resolution limited by wavelength. (See Figure 24.14.) The shorter the wavelength of any probe, the smaller the detail it is possible to observe. Radar Figure 24.14 An image of Sif Mons with lava flows on Venus, based on Magellan synthetic aperture radar data combined with radar altimetry to produce a three-dimensional map of the surface.

Page 286,"How does the ubiquitous microwave oven produce microwaves electronically, and why does food absorb them preferentially? Microwaves at a frequency of 2.45 GHz are produced by accelerating electrons. The microwaves are then used to induce an alternating electric field in the oven. Water and some other constituents of food have a slightly negative charge at one end and a slightly positive charge at one end (called polar molecules). The range of microwave frequencies is specially selected so that the polar molecules, in trying to keep orienting themselves with the electric field, absorb these energies and increase their temperatures—called dielectric heating. The energy thereby absorbed results in thermal agitation heating food and not the plate, which does not contain water. Hot spots in the food are related to constructive and destructive interference patterns. Rotating antennas and food turntables help spread out the hot spots. Another use of microwaves for heating is within the human body. Microwaves will penetrate more than shorter wavelengths into tissue and so can accomplish “deep heating” (called microwave diathermy). This is used for treating muscular pains, spasms, tendonitis, and rheumatoid arthritis. Making Connections: Take-Home Experiment—Microwave Ovens Microwaves generated by atoms and molecules far away in time and space can be received and detected by electronic circuits. Deep space acts like a blackbody with a 2.7 K temperature, radiating most of its energy in the microwave frequency range. In 1964, Penzias and Wilson detected this radiation and eventually recognized that it was the radiation of the Big Bang’s cooled remnants."
Page 286,"The microwave and infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum overlap (see Figure 24.8). Infrared radiation is generally produced by thermal motion and the vibration and rotation of atoms and molecules. Electronic transitions in atoms and molecules can also produce infrared radiation. Infrared radiation The range of infrared frequencies extends up to the lower limit of visible light, just below red. In fact, infrared means “below red.” Frequencies at its upper limit are too high to be produced by accelerating electrons in circuits, but small systems, such as atoms and molecules, can vibrate fast enough to produce these waves. Water molecules rotate and vibrate particularly well at infrared frequencies, emitting and absorbing them so efficiently that the emissivity for skin is e=0.97e=0.97 in the infrared. Night-vision scopes can detect the infrared emitted by various warm objects, including humans, and convert it to visible light. e=0.97e=0.97 We can examine radiant heat transfer from a house by using a camera capable of detecting infrared radiation. Reconnaissance satellites can detect buildings, vehicles, and even individual humans by their infrared emissions, whose power radiation is proportional to the fourth power of the absolute temperature. More mundanely, we use infrared lamps, some of which are called quartz heaters, to preferentially warm us because we absorb infrared better than our surroundings. The Sun radiates like a nearly perfect blackbody (that is, it has e=1e=1), with a 6000 K surface temperature. About half of the solar energy arriving at the Earth is in the infrared region, with most of the rest in the visible part of the spectrum, and a relatively small amount in the ultraviolet. On average, 50 percent of the incident solar energy is absorbed by the Earth. e=1e=1 The relatively constant temperature of the Earth is a result of the energy balance between the incoming solar radiation and the energy radiated from the Earth. Most of the infrared radiation emitted from the Earth is absorbed by CO2CO2 and H2OH2O in the atmosphere and then radiated back to Earth or into outer space. This radiation back to Earth is known as the greenhouse effect, and it maintains the surface temperature of the Earth about 40ºC40ºC higher than it would be if there is no absorption. Some scientists think that the increased concentration of CO2CO2 and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, resulting from increases in fossil fuel burning, has increased global average temperatures.

Visible light Figure 24.15 shows this part of the spectrum, together with the colors associated with particular pure wavelengths. We usually refer to visible light as having wavelengths of between 400 nm and 750 nm. (The retina of the eye actually responds to the lowest ultraviolet frequencies, but these do not normally reach the retina because they are absorbed by the cornea and lens of the eye.) Red light has the lowest frequencies and longest wavelengths, while violet has the highest frequencies and shortest wavelengths. Blackbody radiation from the Sun peaks in the visible part of the spectrum but is more intense in the red than in the violet, making the Sun yellowish in appearance. Figure 24.15 A small part of the electromagnetic spectrum that includes its visible components. The divisions between infrared, visible, and ultraviolet are not perfectly distinct, nor are those between the seven rainbow colors. Living things—plants and animals—have evolved to utilize and respond to parts of the electromagnetic spectrum they are embedded in. Visible light is the most predominant and we enjoy the beauty of nature through visible light. Plants are more selective. Photosynthesis makes use of parts of the visible spectrum to make sugars. Example 24.3 During laser vision correction, a brief burst of 193-nm ultraviolet light is projected onto the cornea of a patient. It makes a spot 0.80 mm in diameter and evaporates a layer of cornea 0.30μm0.30μm thick. Calculate the energy absorbed, assuming the corneal tissue has the same properties as water; it is initially at 34ºC34ºC. Assume the evaporated tissue leaves at a temperature of 100ºC100ºC. 0.30μm0.30μm 34ºC34ºC 100ºC100ºC The energy from the laser light goes toward raising the temperature of the tissue and also toward evaporating it. Thus we have two amounts of heat to add together. Also, we need to find the mass of corneal tissue involved. To figure out the heat required to raise the temperature of the tissue to 100ºC100ºC, we can apply concepts of thermal energy. We know that 100ºC100ºC 24.11 where Q is the heat required to raise the temperature, ΔTΔT is the desired change in temperature, mm is the mass of tissue to be heated, and cc is the specific heat of water equal to 4186 J/kg/K. ΔTΔT mm cc Without knowing the mass 
m
m at this point, we have m
m 24.12 The latent heat of vaporization of water is 2256 kJ/kg, so that the energy needed to evaporate mass mm is mm 24.13 To find the mass mm, we use the equation ρ=m/Vρ=m/V, where ρρ is the density of the tissue and VV  is its volume. For this case, mm ρ=m/Vρ=m/V ρρ VV 24.14 Therefore, the total energy absorbed by the tissue in the eye is the sum of QQ and QvQv: QQ QvQv 24.15 The lasers used for this eye surgery are excimer lasers, whose light is well absorbed by biological tissue. They evaporate rather than burn the tissue, and can be used for precision work. Most lasers used for this type of eye surgery have an average power rating of about one watt. For our example, if we assume that each laser burst from this pulsed laser lasts for 10 ns, and there are 400 bursts per second, then the average power is Qtot×400=150 mWQtot×400=150 mW. Qtot×400=150 mWQtot×400=150 mW Optics is the study of the behavior of visible light and other forms of electromagnetic waves. Optics falls into two distinct categories. When electromagnetic radiation, such as visible light, interacts with objects that are large compared with its wavelength, its motion can be represented by straight lines like rays. Ray optics is the study of such situations and includes lenses and mirrors. When electromagnetic radiation interacts with objects about the same size as the wavelength or smaller, its wave nature becomes apparent. For example, observable detail is limited by the wavelength, and so visible light can never detect individual atoms, because they are so much smaller than its wavelength. Physical or wave optics is the study of such situations and includes all wave characteristics.

What other colors are present in these?"
Page 286,"Ultraviolet means “above violet.” The electromagnetic frequencies of ultraviolet radiation (UV) extend upward from violet, the highest-frequency visible light. Ultraviolet is also produced by atomic and molecular motions and electronic transitions. The wavelengths of ultraviolet extend from 400 nm down to about 10 nm at its highest frequencies, which overlap with the lowest X-ray frequencies. It was recognized as early as 1801 by Johann Ritter that the solar spectrum had an invisible component beyond the violet range. ultraviolet radiation (UV) Solar UV radiation is broadly subdivided into three regions: UV-A (320–400 nm), UV-B (290–320 nm), and UV-C (220–290 nm), ranked from long to shorter wavelengths (from smaller to larger energies). Most UV-B and all UV-C is absorbed by ozone (O3O3) molecules in the upper atmosphere. Consequently, 99% of the solar UV radiation reaching the Earth’s surface is UV-A. O3O3 One of the first illustrations of UV light’s impact on Earth occurred during the Apollo 16 mission in 1972. The mission included the first astronomical images taken from the moon, using a compact and resilient Far Ultraviolet Camera/Spectrograph designed for moon use by scientist and inventor George Robert Carruthers. Designed to capture UV images without the obscuring effects of the Earth’s atmosphere, its most famous image was of the planet itself. Carruthers, who also trained the astronauts on the device’s use, mentioned afterward that “the most immediately obvious and spectacular results were really for the Earth observations, because this was the first time that the Earth had been photographed from a distance in ultraviolet (UV) light, so that you could see the full extent of the hydrogen atmosphere, the polar auroris and what we call the tropical airglow belt.” Figure 24.16 An image of Earth captured with the Far UV Camera/Spectrograph on the Moon. The part of the Earth facing the Sun reflects much UV light and bands of UV emission are also apparent on the side facing away from the Sun. These bands are the result of aurora caused by charged particles given off by the Sun. They spiral toward the Earth along Earth’s magnetic field lines. George Robert Carruthers of the Naval Research Laboratory designed the device specifically for transport and usage on the moon. In the image on the right, Carruthers explains the operating procedure to the Apollo 16 astronauts. (credit, both images: NASA.)"
Page 286,"It is largely exposure to UV-B that causes skin cancer. It is estimated that as many as 20% of adults will develop skin cancer over the course of their lifetime. Again, treatment is often successful if caught early. Despite very little UV-B reaching the Earth’s surface, there are substantial increases in skin-cancer rates in countries such as Australia, indicating how important it is that UV-B and UV-C continue to be absorbed by the upper atmosphere. All UV radiation can damage collagen fibers, resulting in an acceleration of the aging process of skin and the formation of wrinkles. Because there is so little UV-B and UV-C reaching the Earth’s surface, sunburn is caused by large exposures, and skin cancer from repeated exposure. Some studies indicate a link between overexposure to the Sun when young and melanoma later in life. The tanning response is a defense mechanism in which the body produces pigments to absorb future exposures in inert skin layers above living cells. Basically UV-B radiation excites DNA molecules, distorting the DNA helix, leading to mutations and the possible formation of cancerous cells. Repeated exposure to UV-B may also lead to the formation of cataracts in the eyes—a cause of blindness among people living in the equatorial belt where medical treatment is limited. Cataracts, clouding in the eye’s lens and a loss of vision, are age related; 60% of those between the ages of 65 and 74 will develop cataracts. However, treatment is easy and successful, as one replaces the lens of the eye with a plastic lens. Prevention is important. Eye protection from UV is more effective with plastic sunglasses than those made of glass. A major acute effect of extreme UV exposure is the suppression of the immune system, both locally and throughout the body. Low-intensity ultraviolet is used to sterilize haircutting implements, implying that the energy associated with ultraviolet is deposited in a manner different from lower-frequency electromagnetic waves. (Actually this is true for all electromagnetic waves with frequencies greater than visible light.) Flash photography is generally not allowed of precious artworks and colored prints because the UV radiation from the flash can cause photo-degradation in the artworks. Often artworks will have an extra-thick layer of glass in front of them, which is especially designed to absorb UV radiation."
Page 286,"If all of the Sun’s ultraviolet radiation reached the Earth’s surface, there would be extremely grave effects on the biosphere from the severe cell damage it causes. However, the layer of ozone (O3O3) in our upper atmosphere (10 to 50 km above the Earth) protects life by absorbing most of the dangerous UV radiation. O3O3 Unfortunately, today we are observing a depletion in ozone concentrations in the upper atmosphere. This depletion has led to the formation of an “ozone hole” in the upper atmosphere. The hole is more centered over the southern hemisphere, and changes with the seasons, being largest in the spring. This depletion is attributed to the breakdown of ozone molecules by refrigerant gases called chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). The UV radiation helps dissociate the CFC’s, releasing highly reactive chlorine (Cl) atoms, which catalyze the destruction of the ozone layer. For example, the reaction of CFCl3CFCl3 with a photon of light hvhv can be written as: CFCl3CFCl3 hvhv 24.16 The Cl atom then catalyzes the breakdown of ozone as follows: 24.17 A single chlorine atom could destroy ozone molecules for up to two years before being transported down to the surface. The CFCs are relatively stable and will contribute to ozone depletion for years to come. CFCs are found in refrigerants, air conditioning systems, foams, and aerosols. International concern over this problem led to the establishment of the “Montreal Protocol” agreement (1987) to phase out CFC production in most countries. However, developing-country participation is needed if worldwide production and elimination of CFCs is to be achieved. Probably the largest contributor to CFC emissions today is China. And while there are indicators that the Protocol has been a success, there is still substantial risk and variability in the ozone layer. The 2019 Antarctic ozone hole was small and short-lived, continuing the general trend toward recovery. But the 2020 Antarctic ozone hole was the largest and longest-lasting on record, partially due to atmospheric conditions. Furthermore, emissions are not the only concern. Susan Solomon and her colleagues at MIT have uncovered the substantial impact of CFC “banks,” in certain regions, where outdated and deteriorating equipment (such as air conditioners) or materials can release enough CFCs to be detectable in the atmosphere and deplete the ozone layer. (See Figure 24.17.) Figure 24.17 This map of ozone concentration over Antarctica in September 2020 shows severe depletion suspected to be caused by CFCs. In 2020, ozone depletion was significantly worse than in 2019, but better than in the early 2000s. With less ozone, more ultraviolet radiation from the Sun reaches the surface, causing more damage.

Page 286,"Besides the adverse effects of ultraviolet radiation, there are also benefits of exposure in nature and uses in technology. Vitamin D production in the skin (epidermis) results from exposure to UVB radiation, generally from sunlight. A number of studies indicate lack of vitamin D can result in the development of a range of cancers (prostate, breast, colon), so a certain amount of UV exposure is helpful. Lack of vitamin D is also linked to osteoporosis. Exposures (with no sunscreen) of 10 minutes a day to arms, face, and legs might be sufficient to provide the accepted dietary level. However, in the winter time north of about 37º37º latitude, most UVB gets blocked by the atmosphere. 37º37º UV radiation is used in the treatment of infantile jaundice and in some skin conditions. It is also used in sterilizing workspaces and tools, and killing germs in a wide range of applications. It is also used as an analytical tool to identify substances. When exposed to ultraviolet, some substances, such as minerals, glow in characteristic visible wavelengths, a process called fluorescence. So-called black lights emit ultraviolet to cause posters and clothing to fluoresce in the visible. Ultraviolet is also used in special microscopes to detect details smaller than those observable with longer-wavelength visible-light microscopes. Things Great and Small: A Submicroscopic View of X-Ray Production X-rays can be created in a high-voltage discharge. They are emitted in the material struck by electrons in the discharge current. There are two mechanisms by which the electrons create X-rays. The first method is illustrated in Figure 24.18. An electron is accelerated in an evacuated tube by a high positive voltage. The electron strikes a metal plate (e.g., copper) and produces X-rays. Since this is a high-voltage discharge, the electron gains sufficient energy to ionize the atom. Figure 24.18 Artist’s conception of an electron ionizing an atom followed by the recapture of an electron and emission of an X-ray. An energetic electron strikes an atom and knocks an electron out of one of the orbits closest to the nucleus. Later, the atom captures another electron, and the energy released by its fall into a low orbit generates a high-energy EM wave called an X-ray. In the case shown, an inner-shell electron (one in an orbit relatively close to and tightly bound to the nucleus) is ejected. A short time later, another electron is captured and falls into the orbit in a single great plunge. The energy released by this fall is given to an EM wave known as an X-ray. Since the orbits of the atom are unique to the type of atom, the energy of the X-ray is characteristic of the atom, hence the name characteristic X-ray. The second method by which an energetic electron creates an X-ray when it strikes a material is illustrated in Figure 24.19. The electron interacts with charges in the material as it penetrates. These collisions transfer kinetic energy from the electron to the electrons and atoms in the material. Figure 24.19 Artist’s conception of an electron being slowed by collisions in a material and emitting X-ray radiation. This energetic electron makes numerous collisions with electrons and atoms in a material it penetrates. An accelerated charge radiates EM waves, a second method by which X-rays are created. A loss of kinetic energy implies an acceleration, in this case decreasing the electron’s velocity. Whenever a charge is accelerated, it radiates EM waves. Given the high energy of the electron, these EM waves can have high energy. We call them X-rays. Since the process is random, a broad spectrum of X-ray energy is emitted that is more characteristic of the electron energy than the type of material the electron encounters. Such EM radiation is called “bremsstrahlung” (German for “braking radiation”)."
Page 286,"In the 1850s, scientists (such as Faraday) began experimenting with high-voltage electrical discharges in tubes filled with rarefied gases. It was later found that these discharges created an invisible, penetrating form of very high frequency electromagnetic radiation. This radiation was called an X-ray, because its identity and nature were unknown. X-ray As described in Things Great and Small, there are two methods by which X-rays are created—both are submicroscopic processes and can be caused by high-voltage discharges. While the low-frequency end of the X-ray range overlaps with the ultraviolet, X-rays extend to much higher frequencies (and energies). X-rays have adverse effects on living cells similar to those of ultraviolet radiation, and they have the additional liability of being more penetrating, affecting more than the surface layers of cells. Cancer and genetic defects can be induced by exposure to X-rays. Because of their effect on rapidly dividing cells, X-rays can also be used to treat and even cure cancer. The widest use of X-rays is for imaging objects that are opaque to visible light, such as the human body or aircraft parts. In humans, the risk of cell damage is weighed carefully against the benefit of the diagnostic information obtained. However, questions have risen in recent years as to accidental overexposure of some people during CT scans—a mistake at least in part due to poor monitoring of radiation dose. The ability of X-rays to penetrate matter depends on density, and so an X-ray image can reveal very detailed density information. Figure 24.20 shows an example of the simplest type of X-ray image, an X-ray shadow on film. The amount of information in a simple X-ray image is impressive, but more sophisticated techniques, such as CT scans, can reveal three-dimensional information with details smaller than a millimeter. Figure 24.20 This shadow X-ray image shows many interesting features, such as artificial heart valves, a pacemaker, and the wires used to close the sternum. (credit: P. P. Urone) The use of X-ray technology in medicine is called radiology—an established and relatively cheap tool in comparison to more sophisticated technologies. Consequently, X-rays are widely available and used extensively in medical diagnostics. During World War I, mobile X-ray units, advocated by Marie Curie, were used to diagnose soldiers. Because they can have wavelengths less than 0.01 nm, X-rays can be scattered (a process called X-ray diffraction) to detect the shape of molecules and the structure of crystals. X-ray diffraction was crucial to Crick, Watson, and Wilkins in the determination of the shape of the double-helix DNA molecule. X-rays are also used as a precise tool for trace-metal analysis in X-ray induced fluorescence, in which the energy of the X-ray emissions are related to the specific types of elements and amounts of materials present."
Page 286,"Soon after nuclear radioactivity was first detected in 1896, it was found that at least three distinct types of radiation were being emitted. The most penetrating nuclear radiation was called a gamma ray (γγ ray) (again a name given because its identity and character were unknown), and it was later found to be an extremely high frequency electromagnetic wave. gamma ray γγ In fact, γγ rays are any electromagnetic radiation emitted by a nucleus. This can be from natural nuclear decay or induced nuclear processes in nuclear reactors and weapons. The lower end of the γ-rayγ-ray frequency range overlaps the upper end of the X-ray range, but γγ rays can have the highest frequency of any electromagnetic radiation. γγ γ-rayγ-ray γγ Gamma rays have characteristics identical to X-rays of the same frequency—they differ only in source. At higher frequencies, γγ rays are more penetrating and more damaging to living tissue. They have many of the same uses as X-rays, including cancer therapy. Gamma radiation from radioactive materials is used in nuclear medicine. γγ Figure 24.21 shows a medical image based on γγ rays. Food spoilage can be greatly inhibited by exposing it to large doses of γγ radiation, thereby obliterating responsible microorganisms. Damage to food cells through irradiation occurs as well, and the long-term hazards of consuming radiation-preserved food are unknown and controversial for some groups. Both X-ray and γ-rayγ-ray technologies are also used in scanning luggage at airports. γγ γγ γ-rayγ-ray Figure 24.21 This is an image of the γγ rays emitted by nuclei in a compound that is concentrated in the bones and eliminated through the kidneys. Bone cancer is evidenced by nonuniform concentration in similar structures. For example, some ribs are darker than others. (credit: P. P. Urone)"
Page 286,"The entire electromagnetic spectrum is used by researchers for investigating stars, space, and time. Arthur B. C. Walker was a pioneer in X-ray and ultraviolet observations, and designed specialized telescopes and instruments to observe the Sun’s atmosphere and corona. His developments significantly advanced our understanding of stars, and some of his developments are currently in use in space telescopes as well as in microchip manufacturing. As noted earlier, Penzias and Wilson detected microwaves to identify the background radiation originating from the Big Bang. Radio telescopes such as the Arecibo Radio Telescope in Puerto Rico and Parkes Observatory in Australia were designed to detect radio waves. Infrared telescopes need to have their detectors cooled by liquid nitrogen to be able to gather useful signals. Since infrared radiation is predominantly from thermal agitation, if the detectors were not cooled, the vibrations of the molecules in the antenna would be stronger than the signal being collected. The most famous of these infrared sensitive telescopes is the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope in Hawaii. The earliest telescopes, developed in the seventeenth century, were optical telescopes, collecting visible light. Telescopes in the ultraviolet, X-ray, and γγ-ray regions are placed outside the atmosphere on satellites orbiting the Earth. γγ The Hubble Space Telescope (launched in 1990) gathers ultraviolet radiation as well as visible light. In the X-ray region, there is the Chandra X-ray Observatory (launched in 1999), and in the γγ-ray region, there is the new Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (launched in 2008—taking the place of the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, 1991–2000). The James Webb Space Telescope, launched in late 2021, observes in a lower-frequency portion of the spectrum compared to Hubble. The JWST observes in long-wavelength visible light (red) through infrared, enabling it to detect objects that are further away, older, and fainter than previous telescopes could detect. γγ PhET Explorations Color Vision Make a whole rainbow by mixing red, green, and blue light.

But we shall find in later modules that at high frequencies, electromagnetic radiation also exhibits particle characteristics. These particle characteristics will be used to explain more of the properties of the electromagnetic spectrum and to introduce the formal study of modern physics. Another startling discovery of modern physics is that particles, such as electrons and protons, exhibit wave characteristics. This simultaneous sharing of wave and particle properties for all submicroscopic entities is one of the great symmetries in nature."

Conversations with astronauts on lunar walks had an echo that was used to estimate the distance to the Moon. The sound spoken by the person on Earth was transformed into a radio signal sent to the Moon, and transformed back into sound on a speaker inside the astronaut’s space suit. This sound was picked up by the microphone in the space suit (intended for the astronaut’s voice) and sent back to Earth as a radio echo of sorts.

Page 295,The changing of a light ray’s direction (loosely called bending) when it passes through variations in matter is called refraction.
Page 295,"Early attempts to measure the speed of light, such as those made by Galileo, determined that light moved extremely fast, perhaps instantaneously. The first real evidence that light traveled at a finite speed came from the Danish astronomer Ole Roemer in the late 17th century. Roemer had noted that the average orbital period of one of Jupiter’s moons, as measured from Earth, varied depending on whether Earth was moving toward or away from Jupiter. He correctly concluded that the apparent change in period was due to the change in distance between Earth and Jupiter and the time it took light to travel this distance. From his 1676 data, a value of the speed of light was calculated to be 2.26×108 m/s2.26×108 m/s (only 25% different from today’s accepted value). In more recent times, physicists have measured the speed of light in numerous ways and with increasing accuracy. One particularly direct method, used in 1887 by the American physicist Albert Michelson (1852–1931), is illustrated in Figure 25.11. Light reflected from a rotating set of mirrors was reflected from a stationary mirror 35 km away and returned to the rotating mirrors. The time for the light to travel can be determined by how fast the mirrors must rotate for the light to be returned to the observer’s eye. 2.26×108 m/s2.26×108 m/s Figure 25.11 A schematic of early apparatus used by Michelson and others to determine the speed of light. As the mirrors rotate, the reflected ray is only briefly directed at the stationary mirror. The returning ray will be reflected into the observer's eye only if the next mirror has rotated into the correct position just as the ray returns. By measuring the correct rotation rate, the time for the round trip can be measured and the speed of light calculated. Michelson’s calculated value of the speed of light was only 0.04% different from the value used today. The speed of light is now known to great precision. In fact, the speed of light in a vacuum cc is so important that it is accepted as one of the basic physical quantities and has the fixed value cc 25.1 where the approximate value of 3.00×108 m/s3.00×108 m/s is used whenever three-digit accuracy is sufficient. The speed of light through matter is less than it is in a vacuum, because light interacts with atoms in a material. The speed of light depends strongly on the type of material, since its interaction with different atoms, crystal lattices, and other substructures varies. We define the index of refraction nn of a material to be 3.00×108 m/s3.00×108 m/s index of refraction nn 25.2 where vv is the observed speed of light in the material. Since the speed of light is always less than cc in matter and equals cc only in a vacuum, the index of refraction is always greater than or equal to one. vv cc cc Value of the Speed of Light 25.3 Index of Refraction 25.4 That is, n≥1n≥1. Table 25.1 gives the indices of refraction for some representative substances. The values are listed for a particular wavelength of light, because they vary slightly with wavelength. (This can have important effects, such as colors produced by a prism.) Note that for gases, nn is close to 1.0. This seems reasonable, since atoms in gases are widely separated and light travels at cc in the vacuum between atoms. It is common to take n=1n=1 for gases unless great precision is needed. Although the speed of light vv in a medium varies considerably from its value cc in a vacuum, it is still a large speed. n≥1n≥1 nn cc n=1n=1 vv cc Table 25.1 Index of Refraction in Various Media Example 25.1 Calculate the speed of light in zircon, a material used in jewelry to imitate diamond. The speed of light in a material, vv, can be calculated from the index of refraction nn of the material using the equation n=c/vn=c/v. vv nn n=c/vn=c/v The equation for index of refraction states that n=c/vn=c/v. Rearranging this to determine vv gives n=c/vn=c/v vv 25.5 The index of refraction for zircon is given as 1.923 in Table 25.1, and cc is given in the equation for speed of light. Entering these values in the last expression gives cc 25.6 This speed is slightly larger than half the speed of light in a vacuum and is still high compared with speeds we normally experience. The only substance listed in Table 25.1 that has a greater index of refraction than zircon is diamond. We shall see later that the large index of refraction for zircon makes it sparkle more than glass, but less than diamond."
Page 295,"Figure 25.12 shows how a ray of light changes direction when it passes from one medium to another. As before, the angles are measured relative to a perpendicular to the surface at the point where the light ray crosses it. (Some of the incident light will be reflected from the surface, but for now we will concentrate on the light that is transmitted.) The change in direction of the light ray depends on how the speed of light changes. The change in the speed of light is related to the indices of refraction of the media involved. In the situations shown in Figure 25.12, medium 2 has a greater index of refraction than medium 1. This means that the speed of light is less in medium 2 than in medium 1. Note that as shown in Figure 25.12(a), the direction of the ray moves closer to the perpendicular when it slows down. Conversely, as shown in Figure 25.12(b), the direction of the ray moves away from the perpendicular when it speeds up. The path is exactly reversible. In both cases, you can imagine what happens by thinking about pushing a lawn mower from a footpath onto grass, and vice versa. Going from the footpath to grass, the front wheels are slowed and pulled to the side as shown. This is the same change in direction as for light when it goes from a fast medium to a slow one. When going from the grass to the footpath, the front wheels can move faster and the mower changes direction as shown. This, too, is the same change in direction as for light going from slow to fast. Figure 25.12 The change in direction of a light ray depends on how the speed of light changes when it crosses from one medium to another. The speed of light is greater in medium 1 than in medium 2 in the situations shown here. (a) A ray of light moves closer to the perpendicular when it slows down. This is analogous to what happens when a lawn mower goes from a footpath to grass. (b) A ray of light moves away from the perpendicular when it speeds up. This is analogous to what happens when a lawn mower goes from grass to footpath. The paths are exactly reversible. The amount that a light ray changes its direction depends both on the incident angle and the amount that the speed changes. For a ray at a given incident angle, a large change in speed causes a large change in direction, and thus a large change in angle. The exact mathematical relationship is the law of refraction, or “Snell’s Law,” which is stated in equation form as law of refraction 25.7 Here n1n1 and n2n2 are the indices of refraction for medium 1 and 2, and θ1θ1 and θ2θ2 are the angles between the rays and the perpendicular in medium 1 and 2, as shown in Figure 25.12. The incoming ray is called the incident ray and the outgoing ray the refracted ray, and the associated angles the incident angle and the refracted angle. The law of refraction is also called Snell’s law after the Dutch mathematician Willebrord Snell (1591–1626). While the law has been named after Snell, the Arabian physicist, Ibn Sahl, found the law of refraction in 984 and used it in his work On Burning Mirrors and Lenses. Snell’s experiments showed that the law of refraction was obeyed and that a characteristic index of refraction nn could be assigned to a given medium. Snell was not aware that the speed of light varied in different media, but through experiments he was able to determine indices of refraction from the way light rays changed direction. n1n1 n2n2 θ1θ1 θ2θ2 nn The Law of Refraction 25.8 Take-Home Experiment: A Broken Pencil A classic observation of refraction occurs when a pencil is placed in a glass half filled with water. Do this and observe the shape of the pencil when you look at the pencil sideways, that is, through air, glass, water. Explain your observations. Draw ray diagrams for the situation. Example 25.2 Find the index of refraction for medium 2 in Figure 25.12(a), assuming medium 1 is air and given the incident angle is 30.0º30.0º and the angle of refraction is
                    22.0º22.0º. 30.0º30.0º 22.0º22.0º The index of refraction for air is taken to be 1 in most cases (and up to four significant figures, it is 1.000). Thus n1=1.00n1=1.00 here. From the given information, θ1=30.0ºθ1=30.0º and θ2=22.0ºθ2=22.0º. With this information, the only unknown in Snell’s law is n2n2, so that it can be used to find this unknown. n1=1.00n1=1.00 θ1=30.0ºθ1=30.0º θ2=22.0ºθ2=22.0º n2n2 Snell’s law is 25.9 Rearranging to isolate n2n2 gives n2n2 25.10 Entering known values, 25.11 This is the index of refraction for water, and Snell could have determined it by measuring the angles and performing this calculation. He would then have found 1.33 to be the appropriate index of refraction for water in all other situations, such as when a ray passes from water to glass. Today we can verify that the index of refraction is related to the speed of light in a medium by measuring that speed directly. Example 25.3 Suppose that in a situation like that in Example 25.2, light goes from air to diamond and that the incident angle is  30.0º30.0º. Calculate the angle of refraction θ2θ2 in the diamond. 30.0º30.0º θ2θ2 Again the index of refraction for air is taken to be n1=1.00n1=1.00, and we are given θ1=30.0ºθ1=30.0º. We can look up the index of refraction for diamond in Table 25.1, finding n2=2.419n2=2.419. The only unknown in Snell’s law is θ2θ2, which we wish to determine. n1=1.00n1=1.00 θ1=30.0ºθ1=30.0º n2=2.419n2=2.419 θ2θ2 Solving Snell’s law for sin θ2θ2 yields θ2θ2 25.12 Entering known values, 25.13 The angle is thus 25.14 For the same 30º30º angle of incidence, the angle of refraction in diamond is significantly smaller than in water (11.9º11.9º rather than 22º22º—see the preceding example). This means there is a larger change in direction in diamond. The cause of a large change in direction is a large change in the index of refraction (or speed). In general, the larger the change in speed, the greater the effect on the direction of the ray. 30º30º 11.9º11.9º 22º22º"

Page 296,"Fiber optics is one application of total internal reflection that is in wide use. In communications, it is used to transmit telephone, internet, and cable TV signals. Fiber optics employs the transmission of light down fibers of plastic or glass. Because the fibers are thin, light entering one is likely to strike the inside surface at an angle greater than the critical angle and, thus, be totally reflected (See Figure 25.14.) The index of refraction outside the fiber must be smaller than inside, a condition that is easily satisfied by coating the outside of the fiber with a material having an appropriate refractive index. In fact, most fibers have a varying refractive index to allow more light to be guided along the fiber through total internal refraction. Rays are reflected around corners as shown, making the fibers into tiny light pipes. Fiber optics Figure 25.14 Light entering a thin fiber may strike the inside surface at large or grazing angles and is completely reflected if these angles exceed the critical angle. Such rays continue down the fiber, even following it around corners, since the angles of reflection and incidence remain large. Bundles of fibers can be used to transmit an image without a lens, as illustrated in Figure 25.15. The output of a device called an endoscope is shown in Figure 25.15(b). Endoscopes are used to explore the body through various orifices or minor incisions. Light is transmitted down one fiber bundle to illuminate internal parts, and the reflected light is transmitted back out through another to be observed. Surgery can be performed, such as arthroscopic surgery on the knee joint, employing cutting tools attached to and observed with the endoscope. Samples can also be obtained, such as by lassoing an intestinal polyp for external examination. endoscope Fiber optics has revolutionized surgical techniques and observations within the body. There are a host of medical diagnostic and therapeutic uses. The flexibility of the fiber optic bundle allows it to navigate around difficult and small regions in the body, such as the intestines, the heart, blood vessels, and joints. Transmission of an intense laser beam to burn away obstructing plaques in major arteries as well as delivering light to activate chemotherapy drugs are becoming commonplace. Optical fibers have in fact enabled microsurgery and remote surgery where the incisions are small and the surgeon’s fingers do not need to touch the diseased tissue. Figure 25.15 (a) An image is transmitted by a bundle of fibers that have fixed neighbors. (b) An endoscope is used to probe the body, both transmitting light to the interior and returning an image such as the one shown. (credit: Med_Chaos, Wikimedia Commons) Fibers in bundles are surrounded by a cladding material that has a lower index of refraction than the core. (See Figure 25.16.) The cladding prevents light from being transmitted between fibers in a bundle. Without cladding, light could pass between fibers in contact, since their indices of refraction are identical. Since no light gets into the cladding (there is total internal reflection back into the core), none can be transmitted between clad fibers that are in contact with one another. The cladding prevents light from escaping out of the fiber; instead most of the light is propagated along the length of the fiber, minimizing the loss of signal and ensuring that a quality image is formed at the other end. The cladding and an additional protective layer make optical fibers flexible and durable. Figure 25.16 Fibers in bundles are clad by a material that has a lower index of refraction than the core to ensure total internal reflection, even when fibers are in contact with one another. This shows a single fiber with its cladding. Cladding The cladding prevents light from being transmitted between fibers in a bundle. Special tiny lenses that can be attached to the ends of bundles of fibers are being designed and fabricated. Light emerging from a fiber bundle can be focused and a tiny spot can be imaged. In some cases the spot can be scanned, allowing quality imaging of a region inside the body. Special minute optical filters inserted at the end of the fiber bundle have the capacity to image tens of microns below the surface without cutting the surface—non-intrusive diagnostics. This is particularly useful for determining the extent of cancers in the stomach and bowel. Most telephone conversations and Internet communications are now carried by laser signals along optical fibers. Extensive optical fiber cables have been placed on the ocean floor and underground to enable optical communications. Optical fiber communication systems offer several advantages over electrical (copper) based systems, particularly for long distances. The fibers can be made so transparent that light can travel many kilometers before it becomes dim enough to require amplification—much superior to copper conductors. This property of optical fibers is called low loss. Lasers emit light with characteristics that allow far more conversations in one fiber than are possible with electric signals on a single conductor. This property of optical fibers is called high bandwidth. Optical signals in one fiber do not produce undesirable effects in other adjacent fibers. This property of optical fibers is called reduced crosstalk. We shall explore the unique characteristics of laser radiation in a later chapter."
Page 296,"A light ray that strikes an object consisting of two mutually perpendicular reflecting surfaces is reflected back exactly parallel to the direction from which it came. This is true whenever the reflecting surfaces are perpendicular, and it is independent of the angle of incidence. Such an object, shown in Figure 25.17, is called a corner reflector, since the light bounces from its inside corner. Many inexpensive reflector buttons on bicycles, cars, and warning signs have corner reflectors designed to return light in the direction from which it originated. It was more expensive for astronauts to place one on the moon. Laser signals can be bounced from that corner reflector to measure the gradually increasing distance to the moon with great precision. corner reflector Figure 25.17 (a) Astronauts placed a corner reflector on the moon to measure its gradually increasing orbital distance.

(credit: Julo, Wikimedia Commons) Corner reflectors are perfectly efficient when the conditions for total internal reflection are satisfied. With common materials, it is easy to obtain a critical angle that is less than 45º45º. One use of these perfect mirrors is in binoculars, as shown in Figure 25.18. Another use is in periscopes found in submarines. 45º45º Figure 25.18 These binoculars employ corner reflectors with total internal reflection to get light to the observer’s eyes."
Page 296,"Total internal reflection, coupled with a large index of refraction, explains why diamonds sparkle more than other materials. The critical angle for a diamond-to-air surface is only 24.4º24.4º, and so when light enters a diamond, it has trouble getting back out. (See Figure 25.19.) Although light freely enters the diamond, it can exit only if it makes an angle less than 24.4º24.4º. Facets on diamonds are specifically intended to make this unlikely, so that the light can exit only in certain places. Good diamonds are very clear, so that the light makes many internal reflections and is concentrated at the few places it can exit—hence the sparkle. (Zircon is a natural gemstone that has an exceptionally large index of refraction, but not as large as diamond, so it is not as highly prized. Cubic zirconia is manufactured and has an even higher index of refraction (≈2.17≈2.17), but still less than that of diamond.) The colors you see emerging from a sparkling diamond are not due to the diamond’s color, which is usually nearly colorless. Those colors result from dispersion, the topic of Dispersion: The Rainbow and Prisms. Colored diamonds get their color from structural defects of the crystal lattice and the inclusion of minute quantities of graphite and other materials. The Argyle Mine in Western Australia produces around 90% of the world’s pink, red, champagne, and cognac diamonds, while around 50% of the world’s clear diamonds come from central and southern Africa. 24.4º24.4º 24.4º24.4º ≈2.17≈2.17 Figure 25.19 Light cannot easily escape a diamond, because its critical angle with air is so small. Most reflections are total, and the facets are placed so that light can exit only in particular ways—thus concentrating the light and making the diamond sparkle."

Page 298,The lens in which light rays that enter it parallel to its axis cross one another at a single point on the opposite side with a converging effect is called converging lens.
Page 298,"Ray tracing is the technique of determining or following (tracing) the paths that light rays take. For rays passing through matter, the law of refraction is used to trace the paths. Here we use ray tracing to help us understand the action of lenses in situations ranging from forming images on film to magnifying small print to correcting nearsightedness. While ray tracing for complicated lenses, such as those found in sophisticated cameras, may require computer techniques, there is a set of simple rules for tracing rays through thin lenses. A thin lens is defined to be one whose thickness allows rays to refract, as illustrated in Figure 25.25, but does not allow properties such as dispersion and aberrations. An ideal thin lens has two refracting surfaces but the lens is thin enough to assume that light rays bend only once. A thin symmetrical lens has two focal points, one on either side and both at the same distance from the lens. (See Figure 25.29.) Another important characteristic of a thin lens is that light rays through its center are deflected by a negligible amount, as seen in Figure 25.30. Ray tracing thin lens Thin Lens A thin lens is defined to be one whose thickness allows rays to refract but does not allow properties such as dispersion and aberrations. Take-Home Experiment: A Visit to the Optician Look through your eyeglasses (or those of a friend) backward and forward and comment on whether they act like thin lenses. Figure 25.29 Thin lenses have the same focal length on either side. (a) Parallel light rays entering a converging lens from the right cross at its focal point on the left. (b) Parallel light rays entering a diverging lens from the right seem to come from the focal point on the right. Figure 25.30 The light ray through the center of a thin lens is deflected by a negligible amount and is assumed to emerge parallel to its original path (shown as a shaded line). Using paper, pencil, and a straight edge, ray tracing can accurately describe the operation of a lens. The rules for ray tracing for thin lenses are based on the illustrations already discussed: Rules for Ray Tracing"
Page 298,"In some circumstances, a lens forms an obvious image, such as when a movie projector casts an image onto a screen. In other cases, the image is less obvious. Where, for example, is the image formed by eyeglasses? We will use ray tracing for thin lenses to illustrate how they form images, and we will develop equations to describe the image formation quantitatively. Consider an object some distance away from a converging lens, as shown in Figure 25.31. To find the location and size of the image formed, we trace the paths of selected light rays originating from one point on the object, in this case the top of the person’s head. The figure shows three rays from the top of the object that can be traced using the ray tracing rules given above. (Rays leave this point going in many directions, but we concentrate on only a few with paths that are easy to trace.) The first ray is one that enters the lens parallel to its axis and passes through the focal point on the other side (rule 1). The second ray passes through the center of the lens without changing direction (rule 3). The third ray passes through the nearer focal point on its way into the lens and leaves the lens parallel to its axis (rule 4). The three rays cross at the same point on the other side of the lens. The image of the top of the person’s head is located at this point. All rays that come from the same point on the top of the person’s head are refracted in such a way as to cross at the point shown. Rays from another point on the object, such as her belt buckle, will also cross at another common point, forming a complete image, as shown. Although three rays are traced in Figure 25.31, only two are necessary to locate the image. It is best to trace rays for which there are simple ray tracing rules. Before applying ray tracing to other situations, let us consider the example shown in Figure 25.31 in more detail. Figure 25.31 Ray tracing is used to locate the image formed by a lens. Rays originating from the same point on the object are traced—the three chosen rays each follow one of the rules for ray tracing, so that their paths are easy to determine. The image is located at the point where the rays cross. In this case, a real image—one that can be projected on a screen—is formed. The image formed in Figure 25.31 is a real image, meaning that it can be projected. That is, light rays from one point on the object actually cross at the location of the image and can be projected onto a screen, a piece of film, or the retina of an eye, for example. Figure 25.32 shows how such an image would be projected onto film by a camera lens. This figure also shows how a real image is projected onto the retina by the lens of an eye. Note that the image is there whether it is projected onto a screen or not. real image Real Image The image in which light rays from one point on the object actually cross at the location of the image and can be projected onto a screen, a piece of film, or the retina of an eye is called a real image. Figure 25.32 Real images can be projected. (a) A real image of the person is projected onto film. (b) The converging nature of the multiple surfaces that make up the eye result in the projection of a real image on the retina. Several important distances appear in Figure 25.31. We define dodo to be the object distance, the distance of an object from the center of a lens. Image distance didi is defined to be the distance of the image from the center of a lens. The height of the object and height of the image are given the symbols hoho and hihi, respectively. Images that appear upright relative to the object have heights that are positive and those that are inverted have negative heights. Using the rules of ray tracing and making a scale drawing with paper and pencil, like that in Figure 25.31, we can accurately describe the location and size of an image. But the real benefit of ray tracing is in visualizing how images are formed in a variety of situations. To obtain numerical information, we use a pair of equations that can be derived from a geometric analysis of ray tracing for thin lenses. The thin lens equations are dodo Image distance didi hoho hihi thin lens equations 25.24 and 25.25 We define the ratio of image height to object height (hi/hohi/ho) to be the magnification mm. (The minus sign in the equation above will be discussed shortly.) The thin lens equations are broadly applicable to all situations involving thin lenses (and “thin” mirrors, as we will see later). We will explore many features of image formation in the following worked examples. hi/hohi/ho magnification mm Image Distance The distance of the image from the center of the lens is called image distance. Thin Lens Equations and Magnification 25.26 25.27 The image distance is taken to be positive for a real image and negative for a virtual image. The focal length is positive for converging lenses and negative for diverging lenses. Example 25.6 A clear glass light bulb is placed 0.750 m from a convex lens having a 0.500 m focal length, as shown in Figure 25.33. Use ray tracing to get an approximate location for the image. Then use the thin lens equations to calculate (a) the location of the image and (b) its magnification. Verify that ray tracing and the thin lens equations produce consistent results. Figure 25.33 A light bulb placed 0.750 m from a lens having a 0.500 m focal length produces a real image on a poster board as discussed in the example above. Ray tracing predicts the image location and size. Since the object is placed farther away from a converging lens than the focal length of the lens, this situation is analogous to those illustrated in Figure 25.31 and Figure 25.32. Ray tracing to scale should produce similar results for didi. Numerical solutions for didi and mm can be obtained using the thin lens equations, noting that

do=0.750 m and f=0.500 mdo=0.750 m and f=0.500 m. didi didi mm do=0.750 m and f=0.500 mdo=0.750 m and f=0.500 m The ray tracing to scale in Figure 25.33 shows two rays from a point on the bulb’s filament crossing about 1.50 m on the far side of the lens. Thus the image distance didi is about 1.50 m. Similarly, the image height based on ray tracing is greater than the object height by about a factor of 2, and the image is inverted. Thus mm is about –2. The minus sign indicates that the image is inverted. didi mm The thin lens equations can be used to find didi from the given information: didi 25.28 Rearranging to isolate didi gives didi 25.29 Entering known quantities gives a value for 1/di1/di: 1/di1/di 25.30 This must be inverted to find didi: didi 25.31 Note that another way to find  didi is to rearrange the equation: didi 25.32 This yields the equation for the image distance as: 25.33 Note that there is no inverting here. The thin lens equations can be used to find the magnification mm, since both didi and dodo are known. Entering their values gives mm didi dodo 25.34 Note that the minus sign causes the magnification to be negative when the image is inverted. Ray tracing and the use of the thin lens equations produce consistent results. The thin lens equations give the most precise results, being limited only by the accuracy of the given information. Ray tracing is limited by the accuracy with which you can draw, but it is highly useful both conceptually and visually. Real images, such as the one considered in the previous example, are formed by converging lenses whenever an object is farther from the lens than its focal length. This is true for movie projectors, cameras, and the eye. We shall refer to these as case 1 images. A case 1 image is formed when do>fdo>f and ff is positive, as in Figure 25.34(a). (A summary of the three cases or types of image formation appears at the end of this section.) do>fdo>f ff A different type of image is formed when an object, such as a person's face, is held close to a convex lens. The image is upright and larger than the object, as seen in Figure 25.34(b), and so the lens is called a magnifier. If you slowly pull the magnifier away from the face, you will see that the magnification steadily increases until the image begins to blur. Pulling the magnifier even farther away produces an inverted image as seen in Figure 25.34(a). The distance at which the image blurs, and beyond which it inverts, is the focal length of the lens. To use a convex lens as a magnifier, the object must be closer to the converging lens than its focal length. This is called a case 2 image. A case 2 image is formed when do<fdo<f and ff is positive. do<fdo<f ff Figure 25.34 (a) When a converging lens is held farther away from the face than the lens’s focal length, an inverted image is formed. This is a case 1 image. Note that the image is in focus but the face is not, because the image is much closer to the camera taking this photograph than the face. (credit: DaMongMan, Flickr) (b) A magnified image of a face is produced by placing it closer to the converging lens than its focal length. This is a case 2 image. (credit: Casey Fleser, Flickr) Figure 25.35 uses ray tracing to show how an image is formed when an object is held closer to a converging lens than its focal length. Rays coming from a common point on the object continue to diverge after passing through the lens, but all appear to originate from a point at the location of the image. The image is on the same side of the lens as the object and is farther away from the lens than the object. This image, like all case 2 images, cannot be projected and, hence, is called a virtual image. Light rays only appear to originate at a virtual image; they do not actually pass through that location in space. A screen placed at the location of a virtual image will receive only diffuse light from the object, not focused rays from the lens. Additionally, a screen placed on the opposite side of the lens will receive rays that are still diverging, and so no image will be projected on it. We can see the magnified image with our eyes, because the lens of the eye converges the rays into a real image projected on our retina. Finally, we note that a virtual image is upright and larger than the object, meaning that the magnification is positive and greater than 1. virtual image Figure 25.35 Ray tracing predicts the image location and size for an object held closer to a converging lens than its focal length. Ray 1 enters parallel to the axis and exits through the focal point on the opposite side, while ray 2 passes through the center of the lens without changing path. The two rays continue to diverge on the other side of the lens, but both appear to come from a common point, locating the upright, magnified, virtual image. This is a case 2 image. Virtual Image An image that is on the same side of the lens as the object and cannot be projected on a screen is called a virtual image. Example 25.7 Suppose the book page in Figure 25.35 (a) is held 7.50 cm from a convex lens of focal length 10.0 cm, such as a typical magnifying glass might have. What magnification is produced? We are given that do=7.50 cmdo=7.50 cm and f=10.0 cmf=10.0 cm, so we have a situation where the object is placed closer to the lens than its focal length. We therefore expect to get a case 2 virtual image with a positive magnification that is greater than 1. Ray tracing produces an image like that shown in Figure 25.35, but we will use the thin lens equations to get numerical solutions in this example. do=7.50 cmdo=7.50 cm f=10.0 cmf=10.0 cm To find the magnification
mm, we try to use magnification equation,
m=
–di/dom=
–di/do. We do not have a value for
didi, so that we must first find the location of the image using lens equation. (The procedure is the same as followed in the preceding example, where
dodo and
ff were known.) Rearranging the magnification equation to isolate
didi gives mm m=
–di/dom=
–di/do didi dodo ff didi 25.35 Entering known values, we obtain a value for 1/di1/di: 1/di1/di 25.36 This must be inverted to find didi: didi 25.37 Now the thin lens equation can be used to find the magnification mm, since both didi and dodo are known. Entering their values gives mm didi dodo 25.38 A number of results in this example are true of all case 2 images, as well as being consistent with Figure 25.35. Magnification is indeed positive (as predicted), meaning the image is upright. The magnification is also greater than 1, meaning that the image is larger than the object—in this case, by a factor of 4. Note that the image distance is negative. This means the image is on the same side of the lens as the object. Thus the image cannot be projected and is virtual. (Negative values of didi occur for virtual images.) The image is farther from the lens than the object, since the image distance is greater in magnitude than the object distance. The location of the image is not obvious when you look through a magnifier. In fact, since the image is bigger than the object, you may think the image is closer than the object. But the image is farther away, a fact that is useful in correcting farsightedness, as we shall see in a later section. didi A third type of image is formed by a diverging or concave lens. Try looking through eyeglasses meant to correct nearsightedness. (See Figure 25.36.) You will see an image that is upright but smaller than the object. This means that the magnification is positive but less than 1. The ray diagram in Figure 25.37 shows that the image is on the same side of the lens as the object and, hence, cannot be projected—it is a virtual image. Note that the image is closer to the lens than the object. This is a case 3 image, formed for any object by a negative focal length or diverging lens. Figure 25.36 A car viewed through a concave or diverging lens looks upright. This is a case 3 image. (credit: Daniel Oines, Flickr) Figure 25.37 Ray tracing predicts the image location and size for a concave or diverging lens. Ray 1 enters parallel to the axis and is bent so that it appears to originate from the focal point. Ray 2 passes through the center of the lens without changing path. The two rays appear to come from a common point, locating the upright image. This is a case 3 image, which is closer to the lens than the object and smaller in height. Example 25.8 Suppose an object such as a book page is held 7.50 cm from a concave lens of focal length –10.0 cm. Such a lens could be used in eyeglasses to correct pronounced nearsightedness. What magnification is produced? This example is identical to the preceding one, except that the focal length is negative for a concave or diverging lens. The method of solution is thus the same, but the results are different in important ways. To find the magnification mm, we must first find the image distance didi using  thin lens equation mm didi 25.39 or its alternative rearrangement 25.40 We are given that f=–10.0 cmf=–10.0 cm and

do=7.50 cmdo=7.50 cm. Entering these yields a value for 1/di1/di: f=–10.0 cmf=–10.0 cm do=7.50 cmdo=7.50 cm 1/di1/di 25.41 This must be inverted to find didi: didi 25.42 Or 25.43 Now the magnification equation can be used to find the magnification mm, since both didi and dodo are known. Entering their values gives mm didi dodo 25.44 A number of results in this example are true of all case 3 images, as well as being consistent with Figure 25.37. Magnification is positive (as predicted), meaning the image is upright. The magnification is also less than 1, meaning the image is smaller than the object—in this case, a little over half its size. The image distance is negative, meaning the image is on the same side of the lens as the object. (The image is virtual.) The image is closer to the lens than the object, since the image distance is smaller in magnitude than the object distance. The location of the image is not obvious when you look through a concave lens. In fact, since the image is smaller than the object, you may think it is farther away. But the image is closer than the object, a fact that is useful in correcting nearsightedness, as we shall see in a later section. Table 25.3 summarizes the three types of images formed by single thin lenses. These are referred to as case 1, 2, and 3 images. Convex (converging) lenses can form either real or virtual images (cases 1 and 2, respectively), whereas concave (diverging) lenses can form only virtual images (always case 3). Real images are always inverted, but they can be either larger or smaller than the object. For example, a slide projector forms an image larger than the slide, whereas a camera makes an image smaller than the object being photographed. Virtual images are always upright and cannot be projected. Virtual images are larger than the object only in case 2, where a convex lens is used. The virtual image produced by a concave lens is always smaller than the object—a case 3 image. We can see and photograph virtual images only by using an additional lens to form a real image. Table 25.3 Three Types of Images Formed By Thin Lenses In Image Formation by Mirrors, we shall see that mirrors can form exactly the same types of images as lenses. Take-Home Experiment: Concentrating Sunlight Find several lenses and determine whether they are converging or diverging. In general those that are thicker near the edges are diverging and those that are thicker near the center are converging. On a bright sunny day take the converging lenses outside and try focusing the sunlight onto a piece of paper. Determine the focal lengths of the lenses. Be careful because the paper may start to burn, depending on the type of lens you have selected."
Page 298,"Step 1. Examine the situation to determine that image formation by a lens is involved. Step 2. Determine whether ray tracing, the thin lens equations, or both are to be employed. A sketch is very useful even if ray tracing is not specifically required by the problem. Write symbols and values on the sketch. Step 3. Identify exactly what needs to be determined in the problem (identify the unknowns). Step 4. Make alist of what is given or can be inferred from the problem as stated (identify the knowns). It is helpful to determine whether the situation involves a case 1, 2, or 3 image. While these are just names for types of images, they have certain characteristics (given in Table 25.3) that can be of great use in solving problems. Step 5. If ray tracing is required, use the ray tracing rules listed near the beginning of this section. Step 6. Most quantitative problems require the use of the thin lens equations. These are solved in the usual manner by substituting knowns and solving for unknowns. Several worked examples serve as guides. Step 7. Check to see if the answer is reasonable: Does it make sense? If you have identified the type of image (case 1, 2, or 3), you should assess whether your answer is consistent with the type of image, magnification, and so on. Misconception Alert We do not realize that light rays are coming from every part of the object, passing through every part of the lens, and all can be used to form the final image. We generally feel the entire lens, or mirror, is needed to form an image. Actually, half a lens will form the same, though a fainter, image."

Page 299,"Electric room heaters use a concave mirror to reflect infrared (IR) radiation from hot coils. Note that IR follows the same law of reflection as visible light. Given that the mirror has a radius of curvature of 50.0 cm and produces an image of the coils 3.00 m away from the mirror, where are the coils? We are given that the concave mirror projects a real image of the coils at an image distance di=3.00 mdi=3.00 m. The coils are the object, and we are asked to find their location—that is, to find the object distance  dodo. We are also given the radius of curvature of the mirror, so that its focal length is f=R/2=25.0 cmf=R/2=25.0 cm (positive since the mirror is concave or converging). Assuming the mirror is small compared with its radius of curvature, we can use the thin lens equations, to solve this problem. di=3.00 mdi=3.00 m dodo f=R/2=25.0 cmf=R/2=25.0 cm Since didi and ff are known, thin lens equation can be used to find dodo: didi ff dodo 25.46 Rearranging to isolate dodo gives dodo 25.47 Entering known quantities gives a value for 1/do1/do: 1/do1/do 25.48 This must be inverted to find dodo: dodo 25.49 Note that the object (the filament) is farther from the mirror than the mirror’s focal length. This is a case 1 image (do>fdo>f and ff positive), consistent with the fact that a real image is formed. You will get the most concentrated thermal energy directly in front of the mirror and 3.00 m away from it. Generally, this is not desirable, since it could cause burns. Usually, you want the rays to emerge parallel, and this is accomplished by having the filament at the focal point of the mirror. do>fdo>f ff Note that the filament here is not much farther from the mirror than its focal length and that the image produced is considerably farther away. This is exactly analogous to a slide projector. Placing a slide only slightly farther away from the projector lens than its focal length produces an image significantly farther away. As the object gets closer to the focal distance, the image gets farther away. In fact, as the object distance approaches the focal length, the image distance approaches infinity and the rays are sent out parallel to one another."

Assume the spectacle (corrective) lens is held 1.50 cm away from the eye by eyeglass frames. You want this nearsighted person to be able to see very distant objects clearly. That means the spectacle lens must produce an image 30.0 cm from the eye for an object very far away.

Page 307,"We have already noted that color is associated with the wavelength of visible electromagnetic radiation. When our eyes receive pure-wavelength light, we tend to see only a few colors. Six of these (most often listed) are red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet. These are the rainbow of colors produced when white light is dispersed according to different wavelengths. There are thousands of other hues that we can perceive. These include brown, teal, gold, pink, and white. One simple theory of color vision implies that all these hues are our eye’s response to different combinations of wavelengths. This is true to an extent, but we find that color perception is even subtler than our eye’s response for various wavelengths of light. hues The two major types of light-sensing cells (photoreceptors) in the retina are rods and cones. Rods are more sensitive than cones by a factor of about 1000 and are solely responsible for peripheral vision as well as vision in very dark environments. They are also important for motion detection. There are about 120 million rods in the human retina. Rods do not yield color information. You may notice that you lose color vision when it is very dark, but you retain the ability to discern grey scales. rods and cones Figure 26.10 (a) All photoreceptors have inner segments containing the nucleus and other important organelles and outer segments with membrane arrays containing the photosensitive opsin molecules. Rod outer segments are long columnar shapes with stacks of membrane-bound discs that contain the rhodopsin pigment. Cone outer segments are short, tapered shapes with folds of membrane in place of the discs in the rods. (b) Tissue of the retina shows a dense layer of nuclei of the rods and cones. LM × 800. (Micrograph provided by the Regents of University of Michigan Medical School © 2012) Take-Home Experiment: Rods and Cones Cones are most concentrated in the fovea, the central region of the retina. There are no rods here. The fovea is at the center of the macula, a 5 mm diameter region responsible for our central vision. The cones work best in bright light and are responsible for high resolution vision. There are about 6 million cones in the human retina. There are three types of cones, and each type is sensitive to different ranges of wavelengths, as illustrated in Figure 26.11. A simplified theory of color vision is that there are three primary colors corresponding to the three types of cones. The thousands of other hues that we can distinguish among are created by various combinations of stimulations of the three types of cones. Color television uses a three-color system in which the screen is covered with equal numbers of red, green, and blue phosphor dots. The broad range of hues a viewer sees is produced by various combinations of these three colors. For example, you will perceive yellow when red and green are illuminated with the correct ratio of intensities. White may be sensed when all three are illuminated. Then, it would seem that all hues can be produced by adding three primary colors in various proportions. But there is an indication that color vision is more sophisticated. There is no unique set of three primary colors. Another set that works is yellow, green, and blue. A further indication of the need for a more complex theory of color vision is that various different combinations can produce the same hue. Yellow can be sensed with yellow light, or with a combination of red and green, and also with white light from which violet has been removed. The three-primary-colors aspect of color vision is well established; more sophisticated theories expand on it rather than deny it. simplified theory of color vision Figure 26.11 The image shows the relative sensitivity of the three types of cones, which are named according to wavelengths of greatest sensitivity. Rods are about 1000 times more sensitive, and their curve peaks at about 500 nm. Evidence for the three types of cones comes from direct measurements in animal and human eyes and testing of people with color blindness. Consider why various objects display color—that is, why are feathers blue and red in a crimson rosella? The true color of an object is defined by its absorptive or reflective characteristics. Figure 26.12 shows white light falling on three different objects, one pure blue, one pure red, and one black, as well as pure red light falling on a white object. Other hues are created by more complex absorption characteristics. Pink, for example on a galah cockatoo, can be due to weak absorption of all colors except red. An object can appear a different color under non-white illumination. For example, a pure blue object illuminated with pure red light will appear black, because it absorbs all the red light falling on it. But, the true color of the object is blue, which is independent of illumination. Figure 26.12 Absorption characteristics determine the true color of an object. Here, three objects are illuminated by white light, and one by pure red light. White is the equal mixture of all visible wavelengths; black is the absence of light. Similarly, light sources have colors that are defined by the wavelengths they produce. A helium-neon laser emits pure red light. In fact, the phrase “pure red light” is defined by having a sharp constrained spectrum, a characteristic of laser light. The Sun produces a broad yellowish spectrum, fluorescent lights emit bluish-white light, and incandescent lights emit reddish-white hues as seen in Figure 26.13. As you would expect, you sense these colors when viewing the light source directly or when illuminating a white object with them. All of this fits neatly into the simplified theory that a combination of wavelengths produces various hues. Take-Home Experiment: Exploring Color Addition This activity is best done with plastic sheets of different colors as they allow more light to pass through to our eyes. However, thin sheets of paper and fabric can also be used. Overlay different colors of the material and hold them up to a white light. Using the theory described above, explain the colors you observe. You could also try mixing different crayon colors. Figure 26.13 Emission spectra for various light sources are shown. Curve A is average sunlight at Earth’s surface, curve B is light from a fluorescent lamp, and curve C is the output of an incandescent light. The spike for a helium-neon laser (curve D) is due to its pure wavelength emission. The spikes in the fluorescent output are due to atomic spectra—a topic that will be explored later."

Page 307,"The eye-brain color-sensing system can, by comparing various objects in its view, perceive the true color of an object under varying lighting conditions—an ability that is called color constancy. We can sense that a white tablecloth, for example, is white whether it is illuminated by sunlight, fluorescent light, or candlelight. The wavelengths entering the eye are quite different in each case, as the graphs in Figure 26.13 imply, but our color vision can detect the true color by comparing the tablecloth with its surroundings. color constancy Theories that take color constancy into account are based on a large body of anatomical evidence as well as perceptual studies. There are nerve connections among the light receptors on the retina, and there are far fewer nerve connections to the brain than there are rods and cones. This means that there is signal processing in the eye before information is sent to the brain. For example, the eye makes comparisons between adjacent light receptors and is very sensitive to edges as seen in Figure 26.14. Rather than responding simply to the light entering the eye, which is uniform in the various rectangles in this figure, the eye responds to the edges and senses false darkness variations. Figure 26.14 The importance of edges is shown. Although the grey strips are uniformly shaded, as indicated by the graph immediately below them, they do not appear uniform at all. Instead, they are perceived darker on the dark side and lighter on the light side of the edge, as shown in the bottom graph. This is due to nerve impulse processing in the eye. One theory that takes various factors into account was advanced by Edwin Land (1909 – 1991), the creative founder of the Polaroid Corporation. Land proposed, based partly on his many elegant experiments, that the three types of cones are organized into systems called retinexes. Each retinex forms an image that is compared with the others, and the eye-brain system thus can compare a candle-illuminated white table cloth with its generally reddish surroundings and determine that it is actually white. This retinex theory of color vision is an example of modified theories of color vision that attempt to account for its subtleties. One striking experiment performed by Land demonstrates that some type of image comparison may produce color vision. Two pictures are taken of a scene on black-and-white film, one using a red filter, the other a blue filter. Resulting black-and-white slides are then projected and superimposed on a screen, producing a black-and-white image, as expected. Then a red filter is placed in front of the slide taken with a red filter, and the images are again superimposed on a screen. You would expect an image in various shades of pink, but instead, the image appears to humans in full color with all the hues of the original scene. This implies that color vision can be induced by comparison of the black-and-white and red images. Color vision is not completely understood or explained, and the retinex theory is not totally accepted. It is apparent that color vision is much subtler than what a first look might imply. retinexes retinex theory of color vision"

Page 322,"Step 1. Examine the situation to determine that interference is involved. Identify whether slits or thin film interference are considered in the problem. Step 2. If slits are involved, note that diffraction gratings and double slits produce very similar interference patterns, but that gratings have narrower (sharper) maxima. Single slit patterns are characterized by a large central maximum and smaller maxima to the sides. Step 3. If thin film interference is involved, take note of the path length difference between the two rays that interfere. Be certain to use the wavelength in the medium involved, since it differs from the wavelength in vacuum. Note also that there is an additional λ/2λ/2 phase shift when light reflects from a medium with a greater index of refraction. λ/2λ/2 Step 4.

Page 323,"By now you can probably guess that Polaroid sunglasses cut the glare in reflected light because that light is polarized. You can check this for yourself by holding Polaroid sunglasses in front of you and rotating them while looking at light reflected from water or glass. As you rotate the sunglasses, you will notice the light gets bright and dim, but not completely black. This implies the reflected light is partially polarized and cannot be completely blocked by a polarizing filter. Figure 27.43 illustrates what happens when unpolarized light is reflected from a surface. Vertically polarized light is preferentially refracted at the surface, so that the reflected light is left more horizontally polarized. The reasons for this phenomenon are beyond the scope of this text, but a convenient mnemonic for remembering this is to imagine the polarization direction to be like an arrow. Vertical polarization would be like an arrow perpendicular to the surface and would be more likely to stick and not be reflected. Horizontal polarization is like an arrow bouncing on its side and would be more likely to be reflected. Sunglasses with vertical axes would then block more reflected light than unpolarized light from other sources. Figure 27.43 Polarization by reflection. Unpolarized light has equal amounts of vertical and horizontal polarization. After interaction with a surface, the vertical components are preferentially absorbed or refracted, leaving the reflected light more horizontally polarized. This is akin to arrows striking on their sides bouncing off, whereas arrows striking on their tips go into the surface. Since the part of the light that is not reflected is refracted, the amount of polarization depends on the indices of refraction of the media involved. It can be shown that reflected light is completely polarized at a angle of reflection θbθb, given by reflected light is completely polarized θbθb 27.47 where n1n1 is the medium in which the incident and reflected light travel and n2n2 is the index of refraction of the medium that forms the interface that reflects the light. This equation is known as Brewster’s law, and θbθb is known as Brewster’s angle, named after the 19th-century Scottish physicist who discovered them. n1n1 n2n2 Brewster’s law θbθb Brewster’s angle Things Great and Small: Atomic Explanation of Polarizing Filters Polarizing filters have a polarization axis that acts as a slit. This slit passes electromagnetic waves (often visible light) that have an electric field parallel to the axis. This is accomplished with long molecules aligned perpendicular to the axis as shown in Figure 27.44. Figure 27.44 Long molecules are aligned perpendicular to the axis of a polarizing filter. The component of the electric field in an EM wave perpendicular to these molecules passes through the filter, while the component parallel to the molecules is absorbed. Figure 27.45 illustrates how the component of the electric field parallel to the long molecules is absorbed. An electromagnetic wave is composed of oscillating electric and magnetic fields. The electric field is strong compared with the magnetic field and is more effective in exerting force on charges in the molecules. The most affected charged particles are the electrons in the molecules, since electron masses are small. If the electron is forced to oscillate, it can absorb energy from the EM wave. This reduces the fields in the wave and, hence, reduces its intensity. In long molecules, electrons can more easily oscillate parallel to the molecule than in the perpendicular direction. The electrons are bound to the molecule and are more restricted in their movement perpendicular to the molecule. Thus, the electrons can absorb EM waves that have a component of their electric field parallel to the molecule. The electrons are much less responsive to electric fields perpendicular to the molecule and will allow those fields to pass. Thus the axis of the polarizing filter is perpendicular to the length of the molecule. Figure 27.45 Artist’s conception of an electron in a long molecule oscillating parallel to the molecule. The oscillation of the electron absorbs energy and reduces the intensity of the component of the EM wave that is parallel to the molecule.

All we need to solve these problems are the indices of refraction. Air has n1=1.00,n1=1.00, water has n2=1.333,n2=1.333, and crown glass has n′2=1.520n′2=1.520. The equation tanθb=n2n1tanθb=n2n1 can be directly applied to find θbθb in each case. n1=1.00,n1=1.00, n2=1.333,n2=1.333, n′2=1.520n′2=1.520 tanθb=n2n1tanθb=n2n1 θbθb Putting the known quantities into the equation 27.48 gives 27.49 Solving for the angle θbθb yields θbθb 27.50 Similarly, for crown glass and air, 27.51 Thus, 27.52 Light reflected at these angles could be completely blocked by a good polarizing filter held with its axis vertical. Brewster’s angle for water and air are similar to those for glass and air, so that sunglasses are equally effective for light reflected from either water or glass under similar circumstances. Light not reflected is refracted into these media. So at an incident angle equal to Brewster’s angle, the refracted light will be slightly polarized vertically. It will not be completely polarized vertically, because only a small fraction of the incident light is reflected, and so a significant amount of horizontally polarized light is refracted."
Page 323,"If you hold your Polaroid sunglasses in front of you and rotate them while looking at blue sky, you will see the sky get bright and dim. This is a clear indication that light scattered by air is partially polarized. Figure 27.46 helps illustrate how this happens. Since light is a transverse EM wave, it vibrates the electrons of air molecules perpendicular to the direction it is traveling. The electrons then radiate like small antennae. Since they are oscillating perpendicular to the direction of the light ray, they produce EM radiation that is polarized perpendicular to the direction of the ray. When viewing the light along a line perpendicular to the original ray, as in Figure 27.46, there can be no polarization in the scattered light parallel to the original ray, because that would require the original ray to be a longitudinal wave. Along other directions, a component of the other polarization can be projected along the line of sight, and the scattered light will only be partially polarized. Furthermore, multiple scattering can bring light to your eyes from other directions and can contain different polarizations. Figure 27.46 Polarization by scattering. Unpolarized light scattering from air molecules shakes their electrons perpendicular to the direction of the original ray. The scattered light therefore has a polarization perpendicular to the original direction and none parallel to the original direction. Photographs of the sky can be darkened by polarizing filters, a trick used by many photographers to make clouds brighter by contrast. Scattering from other particles, such as smoke or dust, can also polarize light. Detecting polarization in scattered EM waves can be a useful analytical tool in determining the scattering source. There is a range of optical effects used in sunglasses. Besides being Polaroid, other sunglasses have colored pigments embedded in them, while others use non-reflective or even reflective coatings. A recent development is photochromic lenses, which darken in the sunlight and become clear indoors. Photochromic lenses are embedded with organic microcrystalline molecules that change their properties when exposed to UV in sunlight, but become clear in artificial lighting with no UV. Take-Home Experiment: Polarization Find Polaroid sunglasses and rotate one while holding the other still and look at different surfaces and objects. Explain your observations. What is the difference in angle from when you see a maximum intensity to when you see a minimum intensity? Find a reflective glass surface and do the same. At what angle does the glass need to be oriented to give minimum glare?"
Page 323,"While you are undoubtedly aware of liquid crystal displays (LCDs) found in watches, calculators, computer screens, cellphones, flat screen televisions, and other myriad places, you may not be aware that they are based on polarization. Liquid crystals are so named because their molecules can be aligned even though they are in a liquid. Liquid crystals have the property that they can rotate the polarization of light passing through them by 90º90º. Furthermore, this property can be turned off by the application of a voltage, as illustrated in Figure 27.47. It is possible to manipulate this characteristic quickly and in small well-defined regions to create the contrast patterns we see in so many LCD devices. 90º90º In flat screen LCD televisions, there is a large light at the back of the TV. The light travels to the front screen through millions of tiny units called pixels (picture elements). One of these is shown in Figure 27.47 (a) and (b). Each unit has three cells, with red, blue, or green filters, each controlled independently. When the voltage across a liquid crystal is switched off, the liquid crystal passes the light through the particular filter. One can vary the picture contrast by varying the strength of the voltage applied to the liquid crystal. Figure 27.47 (a) Polarized light is rotated 90º90º by a liquid crystal and then passed by a polarizing filter that has its axis perpendicular to the original polarization direction. (b) When a voltage is applied to the liquid crystal, the polarized light is not rotated and is blocked by the filter, making the region dark in comparison with its surroundings. (c) LCDs can be made color specific, small, and fast enough to use in computer monitor screens. (credit: Idaho National Laboratory) Many crystals and solutions rotate the plane of polarization of light passing through them. Such substances are said to be optically active. Examples include sugar water, insulin, and collagen (see Figure 27.48). In addition to depending on the type of substance, the amount and direction of rotation depends on a number of factors. Among these is the concentration of the substance, the distance the light travels through it, and the wavelength of light. Optical activity is due to the asymmetric shape of molecules in the substance, such as being helical. Measurements of the rotation of polarized light passing through substances can thus be used to measure concentrations, a standard technique for sugars. It can also give information on the shapes of molecules, such as proteins, and factors that affect their shapes, such as temperature and pH. optically active Figure 27.48 Optical activity is the ability of some substances to rotate the plane of polarization of light passing through them. The rotation is detected with a polarizing filter or analyzer. Glass and plastic become optically active when stressed; the greater the stress, the greater the effect. Optical stress analysis on complicated shapes can be performed by making plastic models of them and observing them through crossed filters, as seen in Figure 27.49. It is apparent that the effect depends on wavelength as well as stress. The wavelength dependence is sometimes also used for artistic purposes. Figure 27.49 Optical stress analysis of a plastic lens placed between crossed polarizers. (credit: Infopro, Wikimedia Commons) Another interesting phenomenon associated with polarized light is the ability of some crystals to split an unpolarized beam of light into two. Such crystals are said to be birefringent (see Figure 27.50). Each of the separated rays has a specific polarization. One behaves normally and is called the ordinary ray, whereas the other does not obey Snell’s law and is called the extraordinary ray. Birefringent crystals can be used to produce polarized beams from unpolarized light. Some birefringent materials preferentially absorb one of the polarizations. These materials are called dichroic and can produce polarization by this preferential absorption. This is fundamentally how polarizing filters and other polarizers work. The interested reader is invited to further pursue the numerous properties of materials related to polarization. birefringent Figure 27.50 Birefringent materials, such as the common mineral calcite, split unpolarized beams of light into two. The ordinary ray behaves as expected, but the extraordinary ray does not obey Snell’s law."

Page 330,"The first postulate upon which Einstein based the theory of special relativity relates to reference frames. All velocities are measured relative to some frame of reference. For example, a car’s motion is measured relative to its starting point or the road it is moving over, a projectile’s motion is measured relative to the surface it was launched from, and a planet’s orbit is measured relative to the star it is orbiting around. The simplest frames of reference are those that are not accelerated and are not rotating. Newton’s first law, the law of inertia, holds exactly in such a frame. Inertial Reference Frame An inertial frame of reference is a reference frame in which a body at rest remains at rest and a body in motion moves at a constant speed in a straight line unless acted on by an outside force. inertial frame of reference The laws of physics seem to be simplest in inertial frames. For example, when you are in a plane flying at a constant altitude and speed, physics seems to work exactly the same as if you were standing on the surface of the Earth. However, in a plane that is taking off, matters are somewhat more complicated. In these cases, the net force on an object, FF, is not equal to the product of mass and acceleration, mama. Instead, FF is equal to mama plus a fictitious force. This situation is not as simple as in an inertial frame. Not only are laws of physics simplest in inertial frames, but they should be the same in all inertial frames, since there is no preferred frame and no absolute motion. Einstein incorporated these ideas into his first postulate of special relativity. FF mama FF mama first postulate of special relativity First Postulate of Special Relativity The laws of physics are the same and can be stated in their simplest form in all inertial frames of reference. As with many fundamental statements, there is more to this postulate than meets the eye. The laws of physics include only those that satisfy this postulate. We shall find that the definitions of relativistic momentum and energy must be altered to fit. Another outcome of this postulate is the famous equation E=mc2E=mc2. E=mc2E=mc2"

Page 330,"The second postulate upon which Einstein based his theory of special relativity deals with the speed of light. Late in the 19th century, the major tenets of classical physics were well established. Two of the most important were the laws of electricity and magnetism and Newton’s laws. In particular, the laws of electricity and magnetism predict that light travels at c=3.00×108m/sc=3.00×108m/s in a vacuum, but they do not specify the frame of reference in which light has this speed. c=3.00×108m/sc=3.00×108m/s There was a contradiction between this prediction and Newton’s laws, in which velocities add like simple vectors. If the latter were true, then two observers moving at different speeds would see light traveling at different speeds. Imagine what a light wave would look like to a person traveling along with it at a speed cc. If such a motion were possible then the wave would be stationary relative to the observer. It would have electric and magnetic fields that varied in strength at various distances from the observer but were constant in time. This is not allowed by Maxwell’s equations. So either Maxwell’s equations are wrong, or an object with mass cannot travel at speed cc. Einstein concluded that the latter is true. An object with mass cannot travel at speed cc. This conclusion implies that light in a vacuum must always travel at speed cc relative to any observer. Maxwell’s equations are correct, and Newton’s addition of velocities is not correct for light. cc cc cc cc Investigations such as Young’s double slit experiment in the early-1800s had convincingly demonstrated that light is a wave. Many types of waves were known, and all travelled in some medium. Scientists therefore assumed that a medium carried light, even in a vacuum, and light travelled at a speed cc relative to that medium. Starting in the mid-1880s, the American physicist A. A. Michelson, later aided by E. W. Morley, made a series of direct measurements of the speed of light. The results of their measurements were startling. cc Michelson-Morley Experiment The Michelson-Morley experiment demonstrated that the speed of light in a vacuum is independent of the motion of the Earth about the Sun. Michelson-Morley experiment The eventual conclusion derived from this result is that light, unlike mechanical waves such as sound, does not need a medium to carry it. Furthermore, the Michelson-Morley results implied that the speed of light cc is independent of the motion of the source relative to the observer. That is, everyone observes light to move at speed cc regardless of how they move relative to the source or one another. For a number of years, many scientists tried unsuccessfully to explain these results and still retain the general applicability of Newton’s laws. cc cc It was not until 1905, when Einstein published his first paper on special relativity, that the currently accepted conclusion was reached. Based mostly on his analysis that the laws of electricity and magnetism would not allow another speed for light, and only slightly aware of the Michelson-Morley experiment, Einstein detailed his second postulate of special relativity. second postulate of special relativity Second Postulate of Special Relativity The speed of light cc is a constant, independent of the relative motion of the source. cc Deceptively simple and counterintuitive, this and the first postulate leave all else open for change. Some fundamental concepts do change. Among the changes are the loss of agreement on the elapsed time for an event, the variation of distance with speed, and the realization that matter and energy can be converted into one another. You will read about these concepts in the following sections. Misconception Alert: Constancy of the Speed of Light The speed of light is a constant c=3.00×108m/sc=3.00×108m/s in a vacuum. If you remember the effect of the index of refraction from The Law of Refraction, the speed of light is lower in matter. c=3.00×108m/sc=3.00×108m/s Check Your Understanding Explain how special relativity differs from general relativity.

Page 331,"Consider how we measure elapsed time. If we use a stopwatch, for example, how do we know when to start and stop the watch? One method is to use the arrival of light from the event, such as observing a light turning green to start a drag race. The timing will be more accurate if some sort of electronic detection is used, avoiding human reaction times and other complications. Now suppose we use this method to measure the time interval between two flashes of light produced by flash lamps. (See Figure 28.5.) Two flash lamps with observer A midway between them are on a rail car that moves to the right relative to observer B. Observer B arranges for the light flashes to be emitted just as A passes B, so that both A and B are equidistant from the lamps when the light is emitted. Observer B measures the time interval between the arrival of the light flashes. According to postulate 2, the speed of light is not affected by the motion of the lamps relative to B. Therefore, light travels equal distances to him at equal speeds. Thus observer B measures the flashes to be simultaneous. Figure 28.5 Observer B measures the elapsed time between the arrival of light flashes as described in the text. Observer A moves with the lamps on a rail car. Observer B views the light flashes occurring simultaneously. Observer B views the light on the right reaching observer A before the light on the left does. Now consider what observer A sees happening. Since both lamps are the same distance from her in her reference frame and the train is moving to the right, she perceives the flash from the right-hand bulb occurring before the left-hand bulb. Here a relative velocity between observers affects whether two events are observed to be simultaneous. Simultaneity is not absolute.. This illustrates the power of clear thinking. We might have guessed incorrectly that if light is emitted simultaneously, then two observers halfway between the sources would see the flashes simultaneously. But careful analysis shows this not to be the case. Einstein was brilliant at this type of thought experiment (in German, “Gedankenexperiment”). He very carefully considered how an observation is made and disregarded what might seem obvious. The validity of thought experiments, of course, is determined by actual observation. The genius of Einstein is evidenced by the fact that experiments have repeatedly confirmed his theory of relativity. In summary: Two events are defined to be simultaneous if an observer measures them as occurring at the same time (such as by receiving light from the events). Two events are not necessarily simultaneous to all observers."
Page 331,"The consideration of the measurement of elapsed time and simultaneity leads to an important relativistic effect. Time dilation Time dilation is the phenomenon of time passing slower for an observer who is moving relative to another observer. Time dilation Suppose, for example, an astronaut measures the time it takes for light to cross her ship, bounce off a mirror, and return. (See Figure 28.6.) How does the elapsed time the astronaut measures compare with the elapsed time measured for the same event by a person on the Earth? Asking this question (another thought experiment) produces a profound result. We find that the elapsed time for a process depends on who is measuring it. In this case, the time measured by the astronaut is smaller than the time measured by the Earth-bound observer. The passage of time is different for the observers because the distance the light travels in the astronaut’s frame is smaller than in the Earth-bound frame. Light travels at the same speed in each frame, and so it will take longer to travel the greater distance in the Earth-bound frame. Figure 28.6 (a) An astronaut measures the time Δt0Δt0 for light to cross her ship using an electronic timer. Light travels a distance 2D2D in the astronaut’s frame. (b) A person on the Earth sees the light follow the longer path 2s2s and take a longer time ΔtΔt. (c) These triangles are used to find the relationship between the two distances 2D2D and 2s2s. To quantitatively verify that time depends on the observer, consider the paths followed by light as seen by each observer. (See Figure 28.6(c).) The astronaut sees the light travel straight across and back for a total distance of 2D2D, twice the width of her ship. The Earth-bound observer sees the light travel a total distance 2s2s. Since the ship is moving at speed vv to the right relative to the Earth, light moving to the right hits the mirror in this frame. Light travels at a speed cc in both frames, and because time is the distance divided by speed, the time measured by the astronaut is 2D2D 2s2s vv cc 28.1 This time has a separate name to distinguish it from the time measured by the Earth-bound observer. Proper Time Proper time Δt0Δt0 is the time measured by an observer at rest relative to the event being observed. Proper time Δt0Δt0 In the case of the astronaut observe the reflecting light, the astronaut measures proper time. The time measured by the Earth-bound observer is 28.2 To find the relationship between Δt0Δt0 and ΔtΔt, consider the triangles formed by DD and ss. (See Figure 28.6(c).) The third side of these similar triangles is LL, the distance the astronaut moves as the light goes across her ship. In the frame of the Earth-bound observer, Δt0Δt0 ΔtΔt DD ss LL 28.3 Using the Pythagorean Theorem, the distance ss is found to be ss 28.4 Substituting ss into the expression for the time interval ΔtΔt gives ss ΔtΔt 28.5 We square this equation, which yields 28.6 Note that if we square the first expression we had for Δt0Δt0, we get (Δt0)2=

First, as contended, elapsed time is not the same for different observers moving relative to one another, even though both are in inertial frames. Proper time Δt0Δt0 measured by an observer, like the astronaut moving with the apparatus, is smaller than time measured by other observers. Since those other observers measure a longer time ΔtΔt, the effect is called time dilation. The Earth-bound observer sees time dilate (get longer) for a system moving relative to the Earth. Alternatively, according to the Earth-bound observer, time slows in the moving frame, since less time passes there. All clocks moving relative to an observer, including biological clocks such as aging, are observed to run slow compared with a clock stationary relative to the observer. ΔtΔt Δt0Δt0 ΔtΔt Note that if the relative velocity is much less than the speed of light (v<<cv<<c), then v2c2v2c2 is extremely small, and the elapsed times ΔtΔt and Δt0Δt0 are nearly equal.

It has been found that the muon’s half-life as measured by an Earth-bound observer (ΔtΔt) varies with velocity exactly as predicted by the equation Δt=γΔt0Δt=γΔt0. The faster the muon moves, the longer it lives. We on the Earth see the muon’s half-life time dilated—as viewed from our frame, the muon decays more slowly than it does when at rest relative to us.

The two time intervals differ by this factor of 3.20, where classically they would be the same. Something moving at 0.950c0.950c is said to be highly relativistic. γ=3.20γ=3.20 95.0%95.0% v=0.950cv=0.950c 0.950c0.950c Another implication of the preceding example is that everything an astronaut does when moving at 95.0%95.0% of the speed of light relative to the Earth takes 3.20 times longer when observed from the Earth. Does the astronaut sense this? Only if she looks outside her spaceship. All methods of measuring time in her frame will be affected by the same factor of 3.20. This includes her wristwatch, heart rate, cell metabolism rate, nerve impulse rate, and so on. She will have no way of telling, since all of her clocks will agree with one another because their relative velocities are zero. Motion is relative, not absolute. But what if she does look out the window? 95.0%95.0% Real-World Connections It may seem that special relativity has little effect on your life, but it is probably more important than you realize. One of the most common effects is through the Global Positioning System (GPS). Emergency vehicles, package delivery services, electronic maps, and communications devices are just a few of the common uses of GPS, and the GPS system could not work without taking into account relativistic effects. GPS satellites rely on precise time measurements to communicate. The signals travel at relativistic speeds. Without corrections for time dilation, the satellites could not communicate, and the GPS system would fail within minutes."
Page 331,Time dilation is the phenomenon of time passing slower for an observer who is moving relative to another observer. Time dilation
Page 331,"An intriguing consequence of time dilation is that a space traveler moving at a high velocity relative to the Earth would age less than her Earth-bound twin. Imagine the astronaut moving at such a velocity that γ=30.0γ=30.0, as in Figure 28.8. A trip that takes 2.00 years in her frame would take 60.0 years in her Earth-bound twin’s frame. Suppose the astronaut traveled 1.00 year to another star system. She briefly explored the area, and then traveled 1.00 year back. If the astronaut was 40 years old when she left, she would be 42 upon her return. Everything on the Earth, however, would have aged 60.0 years. Her twin, if still alive, would be 100 years old. γ=30.0γ=30.0 The situation would seem different to the astronaut. Because motion is relative, the spaceship would seem to be stationary and the Earth would appear to move. (This is the sensation you have when flying in a jet.) If the astronaut looks out the window of the spaceship, she will see time slow down on the Earth by a factor of γ=30.0γ=30.0. To her, the Earth-bound sister will have aged only 2/30 (1/15) of a year, while she aged 2.00 years. The two sisters cannot both be correct. γ=30.0γ=30.0 Figure 28.8 The twin paradox asks why the traveling twin ages less than the Earth-bound twin. That is the prediction we obtain if we consider the Earth-bound twin’s frame. In the astronaut’s frame, however, the Earth is moving and time runs slower there. Who is correct? As with all paradoxes, the premise is faulty and leads to contradictory conclusions. In fact, the astronaut’s motion is significantly different from that of the Earth-bound twin. The astronaut accelerates to a high velocity and then decelerates to view the star system. To return to the Earth, she again accelerates and decelerates. The Earth-bound twin does not experience these accelerations. So the situation is not symmetric, and it is not correct to claim that the astronaut will observe the same effects as her Earth-bound twin. If you use special relativity to examine the twin paradox, you must keep in mind that the theory is expressly based on inertial frames, which by definition are not accelerated or rotating. Einstein developed general relativity to deal with accelerated frames and with gravity, a prime source of acceleration. You can also use general relativity to address the twin paradox and, according to general relativity, the astronaut will age less. Some important conceptual aspects of general relativity are discussed in General Relativity and Quantum Gravity of this course. In 1971, American physicists Joseph Hafele and Richard Keating verified time dilation at low relative velocities by flying extremely accurate atomic clocks around the Earth on commercial aircraft. They measured elapsed time to an accuracy of a few nanoseconds and compared it with the time measured by clocks left behind. Hafele and Keating’s results were within experimental uncertainties of the predictions of relativity. Both special and general relativity had to be taken into account, since gravity and accelerations were involved as well as relative motion. Check Your Understanding 1.

Page 332,"One thing all observers agree upon is relative speed. Even though clocks measure different elapsed times for the same process, they still agree that relative speed, which is distance divided by elapsed time, is the same. This implies that distance, too, depends on the observer’s relative motion. If two observers see different times, then they must also see different distances for relative speed to be the same to each of them. The muon discussed in Example 28.1 illustrates this concept. To an observer on the Earth, the muon travels at 0.950 c0.950 c for 7.05

Proper Length Proper length L0L0 is the distance between two points measured by an observer who is at rest relative to both of the points. Proper length L0L0 The Earth-bound observer measures the proper length L0L0, because the points at which the muon is produced and decays are stationary relative to the Earth. To the muon, the Earth, air, and clouds are moving, and so the distance LL it sees is not the proper length. L0L0 LL Figure 28.10 (a) The Earth-bound observer sees the muon travel 2.01 km between clouds. (b) The muon sees itself travel the same path, but only a distance of 0.627 km. The Earth, air, and clouds are moving relative to the muon in its frame, and all appear to have smaller lengths along the direction of travel."

Page 332,"To develop an equation relating distances measured by different observers, we note that the velocity relative to the Earth-bound observer in our muon example is given by 28.18 The time relative to the Earth-bound observer is ΔtΔt, since the object being timed is moving relative to this observer. The velocity relative to the moving observer is given by ΔtΔt 28.19 The moving observer travels with the muon and therefore observes the proper time Δt0Δt0. The two velocities are identical; thus, Δt0Δt0 28.20 We know that Δt=γΔt0Δt=γΔt0. Substituting this equation into the relationship above gives Δt=γΔt0Δt=γΔt0 28.21 Substituting for γγ gives an equation relating the distances measured by different observers. γγ Length Contraction Length contraction LL is the shortening of the measured length of an object moving relative to the observer’s frame. Length contraction LL 28.22 If we measure the length of anything moving relative to our frame, we find its length LL to be smaller than the proper length L0L0 that would be measured if the object were stationary. For example, in the muon’s reference frame, the distance between the points where it was produced and where it decayed is shorter. Those points are fixed relative to the Earth but moving relative to the muon. Clouds and other objects are also contracted along the direction of motion in the muon’s reference frame. LL L0L0 Example 28.2 Suppose an astronaut, such as the twin discussed in Simultaneity and Time Dilation, travels so fast that γ=30.00γ=30.00. (a) She travels from the Earth to the nearest star system, Alpha Centauri, 4.300 light years (ly) away as measured by an Earth-bound observer. How far apart are the Earth and Alpha Centauri as measured by the astronaut? (b) In terms of cc, what is her velocity relative to the Earth? You may neglect the motion of the Earth relative to the Sun. (See Figure 28.11.) γ=30.00γ=30.00 cc Figure 28.11 (a) The Earth-bound observer measures the proper distance between the Earth and the Alpha Centauri. (b) The astronaut observes a length contraction, since the Earth and the Alpha Centauri move relative to her ship. She can travel this shorter distance in a smaller time (her proper time) without exceeding the speed of light. First note that a light year (ly) is a convenient unit of distance on an astronomical scale—it is the distance light travels in a year. For part (a), note that the 4.300 ly distance between the Alpha Centauri and the Earth is the proper distance L0L0, because it is measured by an Earth-bound observer to whom both bodies are (approximately) stationary. To the astronaut, the Earth and the Alpha Centauri are moving by at the same velocity, and so the distance between them is the contracted length LL. In part (b), we are given γγ, and so we can find vv by rearranging the definition of γγ to express vv in terms of cc. L0L0 LL γγ vv γγ vv cc 28.23 28.24 Squaring both sides of the equation and rearranging terms gives 28.25 so that 28.26 and 28.27 Taking the square root, we find 28.28 which is rearranged to produce a value for the velocity 28.29 First, remember that you should not round off calculations until the final result is obtained, or you could get erroneous results. This is especially true for special relativity calculations, where the differences might only be revealed after several decimal places. The relativistic effect is large here (γ=30.00γ=30.00), and we see that vv is approaching (not equaling) the speed of light. Since the distance as measured by the astronaut is so much smaller, the astronaut can travel it in much less time in her frame. γ=30.00γ=30.00 vv People could be sent very large distances (thousands or even millions of light years) and age only a few years on the way if they traveled at extremely high velocities. But, like emigrants of centuries past, they would leave the Earth they know forever. Even if they returned, thousands to millions of years would have passed on the Earth, obliterating most of what now exists. There is also a more serious practical obstacle to traveling at such velocities; immensely greater energies than classical physics predicts would be needed to achieve such high velocities. This will be discussed in Relatavistic Energy. Why don’t we notice length contraction in everyday life? The distance to the grocery shop does not seem to depend on whether we are moving or not. Examining the equation L=L01−v2c2L=L01−v2c2, we see that at low velocities (v<<cv<<c) the lengths are nearly equal, the classical expectation. But length contraction is real, if not commonly experienced. For example, a charged particle, like an electron, traveling at relativistic velocity has electric field lines that are compressed along the direction of motion as seen by a stationary observer. (See Figure 28.12.) As the electron passes a detector, such as a coil of wire, its field interacts much more briefly, an effect observed at particle accelerators such as the 3 km long Stanford Linear Accelerator (SLAC). In fact, to an electron traveling down the beam pipe at SLAC, the accelerator and the Earth are all moving by and are length contracted. The relativistic effect is so great than the accelerator is only 0.5 m long to the electron. It is actually easier to get the electron beam down the pipe, since the beam does not have to be as precisely aimed to get down a short pipe as it would down one 3 km long. This, again, is an experimental verification of the Special Theory of Relativity. L=L01−v2c2L=L01−v2c2 v<<cv<<c Figure 28.12 The electric field lines of a high-velocity charged particle are compressed along the direction of motion by length contraction. This produces a different signal when the particle goes through a coil, an experimentally verified effect of length contraction."

Page 333,"For simplicity, we restrict our consideration of velocity addition to one-dimensional motion. Classically, velocities add like regular numbers in one-dimensional motion. (See Figure 28.14.) Suppose, for example, a girl is riding in a sled at a speed 1.0 m/s relative to an observer. She throws a snowball first forward, then backward at a speed of 1.5 m/s relative to the sled. We denote direction with plus and minus signs in one dimension; in this example, forward is positive. Let vv be the velocity of the sled relative to the Earth, uu the velocity of the snowball relative to the Earth-bound observer, and u′u′ the velocity of the snowball relative to the sled. vv uu u′u′ Figure 28.14 Classically, velocities add like ordinary numbers in one-dimensional motion. Here the girl throws a snowball forward and then backward from a sled. The velocity of the sled relative to the Earth is v=1.0m/sv=1.0m/s. The velocity of the snowball relative to the sled is u′u′, while its velocity relative to the Earth is uu. Classically, u=v+u'u=v+u'. Classical Velocity Addition 28.31 Thus, when the girl throws the snowball forward, u=1.0 m/s+1.5 m/s=2.5 m/su=1.0 m/s+1.5 m/s=2.5 m/s. It makes good intuitive sense that the snowball will head towards the Earth-bound observer faster, because it is thrown forward from a moving vehicle. When the girl throws the snowball backward, u=1.0 m/s+(−1.5 m/s)=−0.5 m/su=1.0 m/s+(−1.5 m/s)=−0.5 m/s. The minus sign means the snowball moves away from the Earth-bound observer. u=1.0 m/s+1.5 m/s=2.5 m/su=1.0 m/s+1.5 m/s=2.5 m/s u=1.0 m/s+(−1.5 m/s)=−0.5 m/su=1.0 m/s+(−1.5 m/s)=−0.5 m/s"

Page 333,"The second postulate of relativity (verified by extensive experimental observation) says that classical velocity addition does not apply to light. Imagine a car traveling at night along a straight road, as in Figure 28.15. If classical velocity addition applied to light, then the light from the car’s headlights would approach the observer on the sidewalk at a speed u=v+cu=v+c. But we know that light will move away from the car at speed cc relative to the driver of the car, and light will move towards the observer on the sidewalk at speed cc, too. u=v+cu=v+c cc cc Figure 28.15 According to experiment and the second postulate of relativity, light from the car’s headlights moves away from the car at speed cc and towards the observer on the sidewalk at speed cc. Classical velocity addition is not valid. Relativistic Velocity Addition Either light is an exception, or the classical velocity addition formula only works at low velocities. The latter is the case. The correct formula for one-dimensional relativistic velocity addition is relativistic velocity addition 28.32 where vv is the relative velocity between two observers, uu is the velocity of an object relative to one observer, and u′u′ is the velocity relative to the other observer. (For ease of visualization, we often choose to measure uu in our reference frame, while someone moving at vv relative to us measures u′u′.) Note that the term

vu′c2vu′c2 becomes very small at low velocities, and
u=v+u′1+vu′c2u=v+u′1+vu′c2 gives a result very close to classical velocity addition.

No wonder that it seems correct in our experience. vv uu u′u′ uu vv u′u′ vu′c2vu′c2 u=v+u′1+vu′c2u=v+u′1+vu′c2 Example 28.3 Suppose a spaceship heading directly towards the Earth at half the speed of light sends a signal to us on a laser-produced beam of light. Given that the light leaves the ship at speed cc as observed from the ship, calculate the speed at which it approaches the Earth. cc Figure 28.16 Because the light and the spaceship are moving at relativistic speeds, we cannot use simple velocity addition. Instead, we can determine the speed at which the light approaches the Earth using relativistic velocity addition. 28.33 Relativistic velocity addition gives the correct result. Light leaves the ship at speed cc and approaches the Earth at speed cc. The speed of light is independent of the relative motion of source and observer, whether the observer is on the ship or Earth-bound. cc cc Velocities cannot add to greater than the speed of light, provided that vv is less than cc and u′u′ does not exceed cc. The following example illustrates that relativistic velocity addition is not as symmetric as classical velocity addition. vv cc u′u′ cc Example 28.4 Suppose the spaceship in the previous example is approaching the Earth at half the speed of light and shoots a canister at a speed of 0.750c0.750c.

Page 333,"Although the speed of light does not change with relative velocity, the frequencies and wavelengths of light do. First discussed for sound waves, a Doppler shift occurs in any wave when there is relative motion between source and observer. Relativistic Doppler Effects The observed wavelength of electromagnetic radiation is longer (called a red shift) than that emitted by the source when the source moves away from the observer and shorter (called a blue shift) when the source moves towards the observer. 28.36 In the Doppler equation, λobsλobs is the observed wavelength, λsλs is the source wavelength, and uu is the relative velocity of the source to the observer.

Career Connection: Astronomer If you are interested in a career that requires a knowledge of special relativity, there’s probably no better connection than astronomy. Astronomers must take into account relativistic effects when they calculate distances, times, and speeds of black holes, galaxies, quasars, and all other astronomical objects. To have a career in astronomy, you need at least an undergraduate degree in either physics or astronomy, but a Master’s or doctoral degree is often required.

The wavelength we calculated is 1.70 m, which is redshifted from the original wavelength of 0.525 m. The relativistic Doppler shift is easy to observe. This equation has everyday applications ranging from Doppler-shifted radar velocity measurements of transportation to Doppler-radar storm monitoring. In astronomical observations, the relativistic Doppler shift provides velocity information such as the motion and distance of stars."

There are many aspects of the total energy EE that we will discuss—among them are how kinetic and potential energies are included in EE, and how EE is related to relativistic momentum. But first, note that at rest, total energy is not zero.

For example, if energy is stored in the object, its rest mass increases. This also implies that mass can be destroyed to release energy. The implications of these first two equations regarding relativistic energy are so broad that they were not completely recognized for some years after Einstein published them in 1907, nor was the experimental proof that they are correct widely recognized at first. Einstein, it should be noted, did understand and describe the meanings and implications of his theory. Example 28.6 Calculate the rest energy of a 1.00-g mass. One gram is a small mass—less than half the mass of a penny. We can multiply this mass, in SI units, by the speed of light squared to find the equivalent rest energy. 28.45 Noting that 1kg⋅m2/s2=1 J1kg⋅m2/s2=1 J, we see the rest mass energy is 1kg⋅m2/s2=1 J1kg⋅m2/s2=1 J 28.46 This is an enormous amount of energy for a 1.00-g mass. We do not notice this energy, because it is generally not available. Rest energy is large because the speed of light cc is a large number and c2c2 is a very large number, so that mc2mc2 is huge for any macroscopic mass. The 9.00×1013J9.00×1013J rest mass energy for 1.00 g is about twice the energy released by the Hiroshima atomic bomb and about 10,000 times the kinetic energy of a large aircraft carrier. If a way can be found to convert rest mass energy into some other form (and all forms of energy can be converted into one another), then huge amounts of energy can be obtained from the destruction of mass. cc c2c2 mc2mc2 9.00×1013J9.00×1013J Today, the practical applications of the conversion of mass into another form of energy, such as in nuclear weapons and nuclear power plants, are well known. But examples also existed when Einstein first proposed the correct form of relativistic energy, and he did describe some of them. Nuclear radiation had been discovered in the previous decade, and it had been a mystery as to where its energy originated. The explanation was that, in certain nuclear processes, a small amount of mass is destroyed and energy is released and carried by nuclear radiation. But the amount of mass destroyed is so small that it is difficult to detect that any is missing. Although Einstein proposed this as the source of energy in the radioactive salts then being studied, it was many years before there was broad recognition that mass could be and, in fact, commonly is converted to energy. (See Figure 28.21.) Figure 28.21 The Sun (a) and the Susquehanna Steam Electric Station (b) both convert mass into energy—the Sun via nuclear fusion, the electric station via nuclear fission. (credits: (a) NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center, Scientific Visualization Studio; (b) U.S. government) Because of the relationship of rest energy to mass, we now consider mass to be a form of energy rather than something separate. There had not even been a hint of this prior to Einstein’s work. Such conversion is now known to be the source of the Sun’s energy, the energy of nuclear decay, and even the source of energy keeping Earth’s interior hot."

Page 335,"What happens to energy stored in an object at rest, such as the energy put into a battery by charging it, or the energy stored in a toy gun’s compressed spring? The energy input becomes part of the total energy of the object and, thus, increases its rest mass. All stored and potential energy becomes mass in a system. Why is it we don’t ordinarily notice this? In fact, conservation of mass (meaning total mass is constant) was one of the great laws verified by 19th-century science. Why was it not noticed to be incorrect? The following example helps answer these questions. Example 28.7 A car battery is rated to be able to move 600 ampere-hours (A·h)(A·h) of charge at 12.0 V. (a) Calculate the increase in rest mass of such a battery when it is taken from being fully depleted to being fully charged. (b) What percent increase is this, given the battery’s mass is 20.0 kg? (A·h)(A·h) In part (a), we first must find the energy stored in the battery, which equals what the battery can supply in the form of electrical potential energy. Since PEelec=qVPEelec=qV, we have to calculate the charge qq in 600A·h600A·h, which is the product of the current II and the time tt. We then multiply the result by 12.0 V. We can then calculate the battery’s increase in mass using ΔE=PEelec=(Δm)c2ΔE=PEelec=(Δm)c2. Part (b) is a simple ratio converted to a percentage. PEelec=qVPEelec=qV qq 600A·h600A·h II tt ΔE=PEelec=(Δm)c2ΔE=PEelec=(Δm)c2 28.47 Write amperes A as coulombs per second (C/s), and convert hours to seconds. 28.48 Using the conversion 1kg⋅m2/s2=1J1kg⋅m2/s2=1J, we can write the mass as 1kg⋅m2/s2=1J1kg⋅m2/s2=1J Δm

. 28.49 Both the actual increase in mass and the percent increase are very small, since energy is divided by c2c2, a very large number. We would have to be able to measure the mass of the battery to a precision of a billionth of a percent, or 1 part in 10111011, to notice this increase. It is no wonder that the mass variation is not readily observed. In fact, this change in mass is so small that we may question how you could verify it is real. The answer is found in nuclear processes in which the percentage of mass destroyed is large enough to be measured. The mass of the fuel of a nuclear reactor, for example, is measurably smaller when its energy has been used. In that case, stored energy has been released (converted mostly to heat and electricity) and the rest mass has decreased. This is also the case when you use the energy stored in a battery, except that the stored energy is much greater in nuclear processes, making the change in mass measurable in practice as well as in theory. c2c2 10111011"
Page 335,"Kinetic energy is energy of motion. Classically, kinetic energy has the familiar expression 12mv212mv2. The relativistic expression for kinetic energy is obtained from the work-energy theorem. This theorem states that the net work on a system goes into kinetic energy. If our system starts from rest, then the work-energy theorem is 12mv212mv2 28.50 Relativistically, at rest we have rest energy E0=mc2E0=mc2. The work increases this to the total energy E=γmc2E=γmc2. Thus, E0=mc2E0=mc2 E=γmc2E=γmc2 28.51 Relativistically, we have Wnet=KErelWnet=KErel. Wnet=KErelWnet=KErel Relativistic Kinetic Energy Relativistic kinetic energy is Relativistic kinetic energy 28.52 When motionless, we have v=0v=0 and v=0v=0 28.53 so that KErel=0KErel=0 at rest, as expected. But the expression for relativistic kinetic energy (such as total energy and rest energy) does not look much like the classical 12mv212mv2. To show that the classical expression for kinetic energy is obtained at low velocities, we note that the binomial expansion for γγ at low velocities gives KErel=0KErel=0 12mv212mv2 γγ 28.54 A binomial expansion is a way of expressing an algebraic quantity as a sum of an infinite series of terms. In some cases, as in the limit of small velocity here, most terms are very small. Thus the expression derived for γγ here is not exact, but it is a very accurate approximation. Thus, at low velocities, γγ 28.55 Entering this into the expression for relativistic kinetic energy gives 28.56 So, in fact, relativistic kinetic energy does become the same as classical kinetic energy when v<<cv<<c. v<<cv<<c It is even more interesting to investigate what happens to kinetic energy when the velocity of an object approaches the speed of light. We know that γγ becomes infinite as vv approaches cc, so that KErel also becomes infinite as the velocity approaches the speed of light. (See Figure 28.22.) An infinite amount of work (and, hence, an infinite amount of energy input) is required to accelerate a mass to the speed of light. γγ vv cc The Speed of Light No object with mass can attain the speed of light. So the speed of light is the ultimate speed limit for any particle having mass. All of this is consistent with the fact that velocities less than cc always add to less than cc. Both the relativistic form for kinetic energy and the ultimate speed limit being cc have been confirmed in detail in numerous experiments. No matter how much energy is put into accelerating a mass, its velocity can only approach—not reach—the speed of light. cc cc cc Figure 28.22 This graph of KErelKErel versus velocity shows how kinetic energy approaches infinity as velocity approaches the speed of light. It is thus not possible for an object having mass to reach the speed of light. Also shown is KEclassKEclass, the classical kinetic energy, which is similar to relativistic kinetic energy at low velocities. Note that much more energy is required to reach high velocities than predicted classically. Example 28.8 An electron has a velocity v=0.990cv=0.990c. (a) Calculate the kinetic energy in MeV of the electron. (b) Compare this with the classical value for kinetic energy at this velocity. (The mass of an electron is 9.11×10−31 kg9.11×10−31 kg.) v=0.990cv=0.990c 9.11×10−31 kg9.11×10−31 kg The expression for relativistic kinetic energy is always correct, but for (a) it must be used since the velocity is highly relativistic (close to cc). First, we will calculate the relativistic factor γγ, and then use it to determine the relativistic kinetic energy. For (b), we will calculate the classical kinetic energy (which would be close to the relativistic value if vv were less than a few percent of cc) and see that it is not the same. cc γγ vv cc First calculate γγ. We will carry extra digits because this is an intermediate calculation. γγ 28.57 Next, we use this value to calculate the kinetic energy. 28.58 28.59 28.60 28.61 As might be expected, since the velocity is 99.0% of the speed of light, the classical kinetic energy is significantly off from the correct relativistic value. Note also that the classical value is much smaller than the relativistic value. In fact, KErel/KEclass=12.4KErel/KEclass=12.4 here. This is some indication of how difficult it is to get a mass moving close to the speed of light. Much more energy is required than predicted classically. Some people interpret this extra energy as going into increasing the mass of the system, but, as discussed in Relativistic Momentum, this cannot be verified unambiguously. What is certain is that ever-increasing amounts of energy are needed to get the velocity of a mass a little closer to that of light. An energy of 3 MeV is a very small amount for an electron, and it can be achieved with present-day particle accelerators. SLAC, for example, can accelerate electrons to over 50×109eV=50,000 MeV50×109eV=50,000 MeV. KErel/KEclass=12.4KErel/KEclass=12.4 50×109eV=50,000 MeV50×109eV=50,000 MeV Is there any point in getting vv a little closer to c than 99.0% or 99.9%? The answer is yes. We learn a great deal by doing this. The energy that goes into a high-velocity mass can be converted to any other form, including into entirely new masses. (See Figure 28.23.) Most of what we know about the substructure of matter and the collection of exotic short-lived particles in nature has been learned this way. Particles are accelerated to extremely relativistic energies and made to collide with other particles, producing totally new species of particles. Patterns in the characteristics of these previously unknown particles hint at a basic substructure for all matter. These particles and some of their characteristics will be covered in Particle Physics. vv Figure 28.23 The Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, near Batavia, Illinois, was a subatomic particle collider that accelerated protons and antiprotons to attain energies up to 1 Tev (a trillion electronvolts). The circular ponds near the rings were built to dissipate waste heat. This accelerator was shut down in September 2011. (credit: Fermilab, Reidar Hahn)"
Page 335,"We know classically that kinetic energy and momentum are related to each other, since 28.62 Relativistically, we can obtain a relationship between energy and momentum by algebraically manipulating their definitions. This produces 28.63 where EE is the relativistic total energy and pp is the relativistic momentum. This relationship between relativistic energy and relativistic momentum is more complicated than the classical, but we can gain some interesting new insights by examining it. First, total energy is related to momentum and rest mass. At rest, momentum is zero, and the equation gives the total energy to be the rest energy mc2mc2 (so this equation is consistent with the discussion of rest energy above). However, as the mass is accelerated, its momentum pp increases, thus increasing the total energy. At sufficiently high velocities, the rest energy term (mc2)2(mc2)2 becomes negligible compared with the momentum term

E=pcE=pc at extremely relativistic velocities. EE pp mc2mc2 pp (mc2)2(mc2)2 (pc)2(pc)2 E=pcE=pc If we consider momentum pp to be distinct from mass, we can determine the implications of the equation E2=(pc)2+(mc2)2,E2=(pc)2+(mc2)2,  for a particle that has no mass. If we take mm to be zero in this equation, then E=pcE=pc, or p=E/cp=E/c. Massless particles have this momentum. There are several massless particles found in nature, including photons (these are quanta of electromagnetic radiation). Another implication is that a massless particle must travel at speed cc and only at speed cc. While it is beyond the scope of this text to examine the relationship in the equation E2=(pc)2+(mc2)2,E2=(pc)2+(mc2)2, in detail, we can see that the relationship has important implications in special relativity. pp E2=(pc)2+(mc2)2,E2=(pc)2+(mc2)2, mm E=pcE=pc p=E/cp=E/c cc cc E2=(pc)2+(mc2)2,E2=(pc)2+(mc2)2, Problem-Solving Strategies for Relativity"

Page 341,"Energy is quantized in some systems, meaning that the system can have only certain energies and not a continuum of energies, unlike the classical case. This would be like having only certain speeds at which a car can travel because its kinetic energy can have only certain values. We also find that some forms of energy transfer take place with discrete lumps of energy. While most of us are familiar with the quantization of matter into lumps called atoms, molecules, and the like, we are less aware that energy, too, can be quantized. Some of the earliest clues about the necessity of quantum mechanics over classical physics came from the quantization of energy. Figure 29.3 Graphs of blackbody radiation (from an ideal radiator) at three different radiator temperatures. The intensity or rate of radiation emission increases dramatically with temperature, and the peak of the spectrum shifts toward the visible and ultraviolet parts of the spectrum. The shape of the spectrum cannot be described with classical physics. Where is the quantization of energy observed? Let us begin by considering the emission and absorption of electromagnetic (EM) radiation. The EM spectrum radiated by a hot solid is linked directly to the solid’s temperature. (See Figure 29.3.) An ideal radiator is one that has an emissivity of 1 at all wavelengths and, thus, is jet black. Ideal radiators are therefore called blackbodies, and their EM radiation is called blackbody radiation. It was discussed that the total intensity of the radiation varies as T4,T4, the fourth power of the absolute temperature of the body, and that the peak of the spectrum shifts to shorter wavelengths at higher temperatures. All of this seems quite continuous, but it was the curve of the spectrum of intensity versus wavelength that gave a clue that the energies of the atoms in the solid are quantized. In fact, providing a theoretical explanation for the experimentally measured shape of the spectrum was a mystery at the turn of the century. When this “ultraviolet catastrophe” was eventually solved, the answers led to new technologies such as computers and the sophisticated imaging techniques described in earlier chapters. Once again, physics as an enabling science changed the way we live. blackbodies blackbody radiation T4,T4, The German physicist Max Planck (1858–1947) used the idea that atoms and molecules in a body act like oscillators to absorb and emit radiation. The energies of the oscillating atoms and molecules had to be quantized to correctly describe the shape of the blackbody spectrum. Planck deduced that the energy of an oscillator having a frequency ff is given by ff 29.1 Here nn is any nonnegative integer (0, 1, 2, 3, …). The symbol hh stands for Planck’s constant, given by nn hh Planck’s constant 29.2 The equation E=n+12hfE=n+12hf means that an oscillator having a frequency ff (emitting and absorbing EM radiation of frequency ff) can have its energy increase or decrease only in discrete steps of size E=n+12hfE=n+12hf ff ff 29.3 It might be helpful to mention some macroscopic analogies of this quantization of energy phenomena. This is like a pendulum that has a characteristic oscillation frequency but can swing with only certain amplitudes. Quantization of energy also resembles a standing wave on a string that allows only particular harmonics described by integers. It is also similar to going up and down a hill using discrete stair steps rather than being able to move up and down a continuous slope. Your potential energy takes on discrete values as you move from step to step. Using the quantization of oscillators, Planck was able to correctly describe the experimentally known shape of the blackbody spectrum. This was the first indication that energy is sometimes quantized on a small scale and earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1918. Although Planck’s theory comes from observations of a macroscopic object, its analysis is based on atoms and molecules. It was such a revolutionary departure from classical physics that Planck himself was reluctant to accept his own idea that energy states are not continuous. The general acceptance of Planck’s energy quantization was greatly enhanced by Einstein’s explanation of the photoelectric effect (discussed in the next section), which took energy quantization a step further. Planck was fully involved in the development of both early quantum mechanics and relativity. He quickly embraced Einstein’s special relativity, published in 1905, and in 1906 Planck was the first to suggest the correct formula for relativistic momentum, p=γmup=γmu. p=γmup=γmu Figure 29.4 The German physicist Max Planck had a major influence on the early development of quantum mechanics, being the first to recognize that energy is sometimes quantized. Planck also made important contributions to special relativity and classical physics. (credit: Library of Congress, Prints and Photographs Division via Wikimedia Commons) Note that Planck’s constant hh is a very small number. So for an infrared frequency of 1014Hz1014Hz being emitted by a blackbody, for example, the difference between energy levels is only ΔE=hf= (6.63 × 10–34 J·s)(1014 Hz) = 6.63 × 10–20 J,ΔE=hf= (6.63 × 10–34 J·s)(1014 Hz) = 6.63 × 10–20 J, or about 0.4 eV. This 0.4 eV of energy is significant compared with typical atomic energies, which are on the order of an electron volt, or thermal energies, which are typically fractions of an electron volt. But on a macroscopic or classical scale, energies are typically on the order of joules. Even if macroscopic energies are quantized, the quantum steps are too small to be noticed. This is an example of the correspondence principle. For a large object, quantum mechanics produces results indistinguishable from those of classical physics. hh 1014Hz1014Hz ΔE=hf= (6.63 × 10–34 J·s)(1014 Hz) = 6.63 × 10–20 J,ΔE=hf= (6.63 × 10–34 J·s)(1014 Hz) = 6.63 × 10–20 J,"
Page 341,"Now let us turn our attention to the emission and absorption of EM radiation by gases. The Sun is the most common example of a body containing gases emitting an EM spectrum that includes visible light. We also see examples in neon signs and candle flames. Studies of emissions of hot gases began more than two centuries ago, and it was soon recognized that these emission spectra contained huge amounts of information. The type of gas and its temperature, for example, could be determined. We now know that these EM emissions come from electrons transitioning between energy levels in individual atoms and molecules; thus, they are called atomic spectra. Atomic spectra remain an important analytical tool today. Figure 29.5 shows an example of an emission spectrum obtained by passing an electric discharge through a material. One of the most important characteristics of these spectra is that they are discrete. By this we mean that only certain wavelengths, and hence frequencies, are emitted. This is called a line spectrum. If frequency and energy are associated as ΔE=hf,ΔE=hf, the energies of the electrons in the emitting atoms and molecules are quantized. This is discussed in more detail later in this chapter. atomic spectra ΔE=hf,ΔE=hf, Figure 29.5 Emission spectrum of oxygen. When an electrical discharge is passed through a substance, its atoms and molecules absorb energy, which is reemitted as EM radiation. The discrete nature of these emissions implies that the energy states of the atoms and molecules are quantized. Such atomic spectra were used as analytical tools for many decades before it was understood why they are quantized. (credit: Teravolt, Wikimedia Commons) It was a major puzzle that atomic spectra are quantized. Some of the best minds of 19th-century science failed to explain why this might be. Not until the second decade of the 20th century did an answer based on quantum mechanics begin to emerge. Again a macroscopic or classical body of gas was involved in the studies, but the effect, as we shall see, is due to individual atoms and molecules."

Page 342,"(a) What is the energy in joules and electron volts of a photon of 420-nm violet light? (b) What is the maximum kinetic energy of electrons ejected from calcium by 420-nm violet light, given that the binding energy (or work function) of electrons for calcium metal is 2.71 eV? To solve part (a), note that the energy of a photon is given by E=hfE=hf. For part (b), once the energy of the photon is calculated, it is a straightforward application of KEe=hf–BEKEe=hf–BE to find the ejected electron’s maximum kinetic energy, since BE is given. E=hfE=hf KEe=hf–BEKEe=hf–BE Photon energy is given by 29.6 Since we are given the wavelength rather than the frequency, we solve the familiar relationship c=fλc=fλ for the frequency, yielding c=fλc=fλ 29.7 Combining these two equations gives the useful relationship 29.8 Now substituting known values yields 29.9 Converting to eV, the energy of the photon is 29.10 Finding the kinetic energy of the ejected electron is now a simple application of the equation KEe=hf–BEKEe=hf–BE. Substituting the photon energy and binding energy yields KEe=hf–BEKEe=hf–BE 29.11 The energy of this 420-nm photon of violet light is a tiny fraction of a joule, and so it is no wonder that a single photon would be difficult for us to sense directly—humans are more attuned to energies on the order of joules. But looking at the energy in electron volts, we can see that this photon has enough energy to affect atoms and molecules. A DNA molecule can be broken with about 1 eV of energy, for example, and typical atomic and molecular energies are on the order of eV, so that the UV photon in this example could have biological effects. The ejected electron (called a photoelectron) has a rather low energy, and it would not travel far, except in a vacuum. The electron would be stopped by a retarding potential of but 0.26 eV. In fact, if the photon wavelength were longer and its energy less than 2.71 eV, then the formula would give a negative kinetic energy, an impossibility. This simply means that the 420-nm photons with their 2.96-eV energy are not much above the frequency threshold. You can show for yourself that the threshold wavelength is 459 nm (blue light). This means that if calcium metal is used in a light meter, the meter will be insensitive to wavelengths longer than those of blue light. Such a light meter would be completely insensitive to red light, for example."

Page 343,"A photon is a quantum of EM radiation. Its energy is given by E=hfE=hf and is related to the frequency ff and wavelength λλ of the radiation by E=hfE=hf ff λλ 29.12 where EE is the energy of a single photon and cc is the speed of light. When working with small systems, energy in eV is often useful. Note that Planck’s constant in these units is EE cc 29.13 Since many wavelengths are stated in nanometers (nm), it is also useful to know that 29.14 These will make many calculations a little easier. All EM radiation is composed of photons. Figure 29.9 shows various divisions of the EM spectrum plotted against wavelength, frequency, and photon energy. Previously in this book, photon characteristics were alluded to in the discussion of some of the characteristics of UV, x rays, and γγ rays, the first of which start with frequencies just above violet in the visible spectrum. It was noted that these types of EM radiation have characteristics much different than visible light. We can now see that such properties arise because photon energy is larger at high frequencies. γγ Figure 29.9 The EM spectrum, showing major categories as a function of photon energy in eV, as well as wavelength and frequency. Certain characteristics of EM radiation are directly attributable to photon energy alone. Table 29.1 Representative Energies for Submicroscopic Effects (Order of Magnitude Only) Photons act as individual quanta and interact with individual electrons, atoms, molecules, and so on. The energy a photon carries is, thus, crucial to the effects it has. Table 29.1 lists representative submicroscopic energies in eV. When we compare photon energies from the EM spectrum in Figure 29.9 with energies in the table, we can see how effects vary with the type of EM radiation. Gamma rays, a form of nuclear and cosmic EM radiation, can have the highest frequencies and, hence, the highest photon energies in the EM spectrum. For example, a γγ-ray photon with f= 1021
 Hzf= 1021
 Hz has an energy E=hf=6.63× 10–13
 J=4.14 MeV.E=hf=6.63× 10–13
 J=4.14 MeV. This is sufficient energy to ionize thousands of atoms and molecules, since only 10 to 1000 eV are needed per ionization. In fact, γγ rays are one type of ionizing radiation, as are x rays and UV, because they produce ionization in materials that absorb them. Because so much ionization can be produced, a single γγ-ray photon can cause significant damage to biological tissue, killing cells or damaging their ability to properly reproduce. When cell reproduction is disrupted, the result can be cancer, one of the known effects of exposure to ionizing radiation. Since cancer cells are rapidly reproducing, they are exceptionally sensitive to the disruption produced by ionizing radiation. This means that ionizing radiation has positive uses in cancer treatment as well as risks in producing cancer. Gamma rays γγ f= 1021

 J=4.14 MeV. γγ ionizing radiation γγ Figure 29.10 One of the first x-ray images, taken by Röentgen himself. The hand belongs to Bertha Röentgen, his wife. (credit: Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen, via Wikimedia Commons) High photon energy also enables γγ rays to penetrate materials, since a collision with a single atom or molecule is unlikely to absorb all the γγ ray’s energy. This can make γγ rays useful as a probe, and they are sometimes used in medical imaging. x rays, as you can see in Figure 29.9, overlap with the low-frequency end of the γγ ray range. Since x rays have energies of keV and up, individual x-ray photons also can produce large amounts of ionization. At lower photon energies, x rays are not as penetrating as γγ rays and are slightly less hazardous. X rays are ideal for medical imaging, their most common use, and a fact that was recognized immediately upon their discovery in 1895 by the German physicist W. C. Roentgen (1845–1923). (See Figure 29.10.) Within one year of their discovery, x rays (for a time called Roentgen rays) were used for medical diagnostics. Roentgen received the 1901 Nobel Prize for the discovery of x rays. γγ γγ γγ x rays γγ γγ Connections: Conservation of Energy Once again, we find that conservation of energy allows us to consider the initial and final forms that energy takes, without having to make detailed calculations of the intermediate steps.  Example 29.2 is solved by considering only the initial and final forms of energy. Figure 29.11 X rays are produced when energetic electrons strike the copper anode of this cathode ray tube (CRT). Electrons (shown here as separate particles) interact individually with the material they strike, sometimes producing photons of EM radiation. While γγ rays originate in nuclear decay, x rays are produced by the process shown in Figure 29.11. Electrons ejected by thermal agitation from a hot filament in a vacuum tube are accelerated through a high voltage, gaining kinetic energy from the electrical potential energy. When they strike the anode, the electrons convert their kinetic energy to a variety of forms, including thermal energy. But since an accelerated charge radiates EM waves, and since the electrons act individually, photons are also produced. Some of these x-ray photons obtain the kinetic energy of the electron. The accelerated electrons originate at the cathode, so such a tube is called a cathode ray tube (CRT), and various versions of them are found in older TV and computer screens as well as in x-ray machines. γγ Example 29.2 Find the maximum energy in eV of an x-ray photon produced by electrons accelerated through a potential difference of 50.0 kV in a CRT like the one in Figure 29.11. Electrons can give all of their kinetic energy to a single photon when they strike the anode of a CRT. (This is something like the photoelectric effect in reverse.) The kinetic energy of the electron comes from electrical potential energy. Thus we can simply equate the maximum photon energy to the electrical potential energy—that is, hf=qV.hf=qV. (We do not have to calculate each step from beginning to end if we know that all of the starting energy qVqV is converted to the final form hf.hf.) hf=qV.hf=qV. qVqV hf.hf. The maximum photon energy is hf=qVhf=qV, where qq is the charge of the electron and VV is the accelerating voltage. Thus, hf=qVhf=qV qq VV 29.15 From the definition of the electron volt, we know 1 eV = 1.60 × 10–19 J1 eV = 1.60 × 10–19 J, where 1 J=1 C⋅V.1 J=1 C⋅V. Gathering factors and converting energy to eV yields 1 eV = 1.60 × 10–19 J1 eV = 1.60 × 10–19 J 1 J=1 C⋅V.1 J=1 C⋅V. 29.16 This example produces a result that can be applied to many similar situations. If you accelerate a single elementary charge, like that of an electron, through a potential given in volts, then its energy in eV has the same numerical value. Thus a 50.0-kV potential generates 50.0 keV electrons, which in turn can produce photons with a maximum energy of 50 keV. Similarly, a 100-kV potential in an x-ray tube can generate up to 100-keV x-ray photons. Many x-ray tubes have adjustable voltages so that various energy x rays with differing energies, and therefore differing abilities to penetrate, can be generated. Figure 29.12 X-ray spectrum obtained when energetic electrons strike a material. The smooth part of the spectrum is bremsstrahlung, while the peaks are characteristic of the anode material. Both are atomic processes that produce energetic photons known as x-ray photons. Figure 29.12 shows the spectrum of x rays obtained from an x-ray tube. There are two distinct features to the spectrum. First, the smooth distribution results from electrons being decelerated in the anode material. A curve like this is obtained by detecting many photons, and it is apparent that the maximum energy is unlikely. This decelerating process produces radiation that is called bremsstrahlung (German for braking radiation). The second feature is the existence of sharp peaks in the spectrum; these are called characteristic x rays, since they are characteristic of the anode material. Characteristic x rays come from atomic excitations unique to a given type of anode material. They are akin to lines in atomic spectra, implying the energy levels of atoms are quantized. Phenomena such as discrete atomic spectra and characteristic x rays are explored further in Atomic Physics. bremsstrahlung characteristic x rays Ultraviolet radiation (approximately 4 eV to 300 eV) overlaps with the low end of the energy range of x rays, but UV is typically lower in energy. UV comes from the de-excitation of atoms that may be part of a hot solid or gas. These atoms can be given energy that they later release as UV by numerous processes, including electric discharge, nuclear explosion, thermal agitation, and exposure to x rays. A UV photon has sufficient energy to ionize atoms and molecules, which makes its effects different from those of visible light. UV thus has some of the same biological effects as γγ rays and x rays. For example, it can cause skin cancer and is used as a sterilizer. The major difference is that several UV photons are required to disrupt cell reproduction or kill a bacterium, whereas single γγ-ray and X-ray photons can do the same damage. But since UV does have the energy to alter molecules, it can do what visible light cannot. One of the beneficial aspects of UV is that it triggers the production of vitamin D in the skin, whereas visible light has insufficient energy per photon to alter the molecules that trigger this production. Infantile jaundice is treated by exposing the baby to UV (with eye protection), called phototherapy, the beneficial effects of which are thought to be related to its ability to help prevent the buildup of potentially toxic bilirubin in the blood. Ultraviolet radiation γγ γγ Example 29.3 Short-wavelength UV is sometimes called vacuum UV, because it is strongly absorbed by air and must be studied in a vacuum. Calculate the photon energy in eV for 100-nm vacuum UV, and estimate the number of molecules it could ionize or break apart. Using the equation E=hfE=hf and appropriate constants, we can find the photon energy and compare it with energy information in Table 29.1. E=hfE=hf The energy of a photon is given by 29.17 Using hc= 1240 eV ⋅ nm,hc= 1240 eV ⋅ nm, we find that hc= 1240 eV ⋅ nm,hc= 1240 eV ⋅ nm, 29.18 According to Table 29.1, this photon energy might be able to ionize an atom or molecule, and it is about what is needed to break up a tightly bound molecule, since they are bound by approximately 10 eV. This photon energy could destroy about a dozen weakly bound molecules. Because of its high photon energy, UV disrupts atoms and molecules it interacts with. One good consequence is that all but the longest-wavelength UV is strongly absorbed and is easily blocked by sunglasses. In fact, most of the Sun’s UV is absorbed by a thin layer of ozone in the upper atmosphere, protecting sensitive organisms on Earth. Damage to our ozone layer by the addition of such chemicals as CFC’s has reduced this protection for us."
Page 343,"Once again, we find that conservation of energy allows us to consider the initial and final forms that energy takes, without having to make detailed calculations of the intermediate steps.  Example 29.2 is solved by considering only the initial and final forms of energy."
Page 343,"The range of photon energies for visible light from red to violet is 1.63 to 3.26 eV, respectively (left for this chapter’s Problems and Exercises to verify). These energies are on the order of those between outer electron shells in atoms and molecules. This means that these photons can be absorbed by atoms and molecules. A single photon can actually stimulate the retina, for example, by altering a receptor molecule that then triggers a nerve impulse. Photons can be absorbed or emitted only by atoms and molecules that have precisely the correct quantized energy step to do so. For example, if a red photon of frequency ff encounters a molecule that has an energy step, ΔE,ΔE, equal to hf,hf, then the photon can be absorbed. Violet flowers absorb red and reflect violet; this implies there is no energy step between levels in the receptor molecule equal to the violet photon’s energy, but there is an energy step for the red. visible light ff ΔE,ΔE, hf,hf, There are some noticeable differences in the characteristics of light between the two ends of the visible spectrum that are due to photon energies. Red light has insufficient photon energy to expose most black-and-white film, and it is thus used to illuminate darkrooms where such film is developed. Since violet light has a higher photon energy, dyes that absorb violet tend to fade more quickly than those that do not. (See Figure 29.13.) Take a look at some faded color posters in a storefront some time, and you will notice that the blues and violets are the last to fade. This is because other dyes, such as red and green dyes, absorb blue and violet photons, the higher energies of which break up their weakly bound molecules. (Complex molecules such as those in dyes and DNA tend to be weakly bound.) Blue and violet dyes reflect those colors and, therefore, do not absorb these more energetic photons, thus suffering less molecular damage. Figure 29.13 Why do the reds, yellows, and greens fade before the blues and violets when exposed to the Sun, as with this poster? The answer is related to photon energy. (credit: Deb Collins, Flickr) Transparent materials, such as some glasses, do not absorb any visible light, because there is no energy step in the atoms or molecules that could absorb the light. Since individual photons interact with individual atoms, it is nearly impossible to have two photons absorbed simultaneously to reach a large energy step. Because of its lower photon energy, visible light can sometimes pass through many kilometers of a substance, while higher frequencies like UV, x ray, and γγ rays are absorbed, because they have sufficient photon energy to ionize the material. γγ Example 29.4 Assuming that 10.0% of a 100-W light bulb’s energy output is in the visible range (typical for incandescent bulbs) with an average wavelength of 580 nm, calculate the number of visible photons emitted per second. Power is energy per unit time, and so if we can find the energy per photon, we can determine the number of photons per second. This will best be done in joules, since power is given in watts, which are joules per second. The power in visible light production is 10.0% of 100 W, or 10.0 J/s. The energy of the average visible photon is found by substituting the given average wavelength into the formula 29.19 This produces 29.20 The number of visible photons per second is thus 29.21 This incredible number of photons per second is verification that individual photons are insignificant in ordinary human experience. It is also a verification of the correspondence principle—on the macroscopic scale, quantization becomes essentially continuous or classical. Finally, there are so many photons emitted by a 100-W lightbulb that it can be seen by the unaided eye many kilometers away."
Page 343,"Infrared radiation (IR) has even lower photon energies than visible light and cannot significantly alter atoms and molecules. IR can be absorbed and emitted by atoms and molecules, particularly between closely spaced states. IR is extremely strongly absorbed by water, for example, because water molecules have many states separated by energies on the order of  10–5 eV  10–5 eV  to  10–2 eV, 10–2 eV, well within the IR and microwave energy ranges. This is why in the IR range, skin is almost jet black, with an emissivity near 1—there are many states in water molecules in the skin that can absorb a large range of IR photon energies. Not all molecules have this property. Air, for example, is nearly transparent to many IR frequencies. Infrared radiation (IR) 10–5 eV  10–5 eV 10–2 eV, 10–2 eV, Microwaves are the highest frequencies that can be produced by electronic circuits, although they are also produced naturally. Thus microwaves are similar to IR but do not extend to as high frequencies. There are states in water and other molecules that have the same frequency and energy as microwaves, typically about  10–5 eV. 10–5 eV. This is one reason why food absorbs microwaves more strongly than many other materials, making microwave ovens an efficient way of putting energy directly into food. Microwaves 10–5 eV. 10–5 eV. Photon energies for both IR and microwaves are so low that huge numbers of photons are involved in any significant energy transfer by IR or microwaves (such as warming yourself with a heat lamp or cooking pizza in the microwave). Visible light, IR, microwaves, and all lower frequencies cannot produce ionization with single photons and do not ordinarily have the hazards of higher frequencies. When visible, IR, or microwave radiation is hazardous, such as the inducement of cataracts by microwaves, the hazard is due to huge numbers of photons acting together (not to an accumulation of photons, such as sterilization by weak UV). The negative effects of visible, IR, or microwave radiation can be thermal effects, which could be produced by any heat source. But one difference is that at very high intensity, strong electric and magnetic fields can be produced by photons acting together. Such electromagnetic fields (EMF) can actually ionize materials. Misconception Alert: High-Voltage Power Lines Although some people think that living near high-voltage power lines is hazardous to one’s health, ongoing studies of the transient field effects produced by these lines show their strengths to be insufficient to cause damage. Demographic studies also fail to show significant correlation of ill effects with high-voltage power lines. The American Physical Society issued a report over 20 years ago on power-line fields, and additional studies since that time show no consistent, significant link between cancer and power-line fields. It is virtually impossible to detect individual photons having frequencies below microwave frequencies, because of their low photon energy. But the photons are there. A continuous EM wave can be modeled as photons. At low frequencies, EM waves are generally treated as time- and position-varying electric and magnetic fields with no discernible quantization. This is another example of the correspondence principle in situations involving huge numbers of photons."

Page 344,"The quantum of EM radiation we call a photon has properties analogous to those of particles we can see, such as grains of sand. A photon interacts as a unit in collisions or when absorbed, rather than as an extensive wave. Massive quanta, like electrons, also act like macroscopic particles—something we expect, because they are the smallest units of matter. Particles carry momentum as well as energy. Despite photons having no mass, there has long been evidence that EM radiation carries momentum. (Maxwell and others who studied EM waves predicted that they would carry momentum.) It is now a well-established fact that photons do have momentum. In fact, photon momentum is suggested by the photoelectric effect, where photons knock electrons out of a substance. Figure 29.14 shows macroscopic evidence of photon momentum. photon Figure 29.14 The tails of the Hale-Bopp comet point away from the Sun, evidence that light has momentum. Dust emanating from the body of the comet forms this tail. Particles of dust are pushed away from the Sun by light reflecting from them. The blue ionized gas tail is also produced by photons interacting with atoms in the comet material. (credit: Geoff Chester, U.S. Navy, via Wikimedia Commons) Figure 29.14 shows a comet with two prominent tails. What most people do not know about the tails is that they always point away from the Sun rather than trailing behind the comet (like the tail of Bo Peep’s sheep). Comet tails are composed of gases and dust evaporated from the body of the comet and ionized gas. The dust particles recoil away from the Sun when photons scatter from them. Evidently, photons carry momentum in the direction of their motion (away from the Sun), and some of this momentum is transferred to dust particles in collisions. Gas atoms and molecules in the blue tail are most affected by other particles of radiation, such as protons and electrons emanating from the Sun, rather than by the momentum of photons. Connections: Conservation of Momentum Not only is momentum conserved in all realms of physics, but all types of particles are found to have momentum. We expect particles with mass to have momentum, but now we see that massless particles including photons also carry momentum. Momentum is conserved in quantum mechanics just as it is in relativity and classical physics. Some of the earliest direct experimental evidence of this came from scattering of x-ray photons by electrons in substances, named Compton scattering after the American physicist Arthur H. Compton (1892–1962). Around 1923, Compton observed that x rays scattered from materials had a decreased energy and correctly analyzed this as being due to the scattering of photons from electrons. This phenomenon could be handled as a collision between two particles—a photon and an electron at rest in the material. Energy and momentum are conserved in the collision. (See Figure 29.15) He won a Nobel Prize in 1929 for the discovery of this scattering, now called the Compton effect, because it helped prove that photon momentum is given by Compton effect photon momentum 29.22 where hh is Planck’s constant and λλ is the photon wavelength. (Note that relativistic momentum given as p=γmup=γmu is valid only for particles having mass.) hh λλ p=γmup=γmu Figure 29.15 The Compton effect is the name given to the scattering of a photon by an electron. Energy and momentum are conserved, resulting in a reduction of both for the scattered photon. Studying this effect, Compton verified that photons have momentum. We can see that photon momentum is small, since p=h/λp=h/λ and hh is very small. It is for this reason that we do not ordinarily observe photon momentum. Our mirrors do not recoil when light reflects from them (except perhaps in cartoons). Compton saw the effects of photon momentum because he was observing x rays, which have a small wavelength and a relatively large momentum, interacting with the lightest of particles, the electron. p=h/λp=h/λ hh Example 29.5 (a) Calculate the momentum of a visible photon that has a wavelength of 500 nm. (b) Find the velocity of an electron having the same momentum. (c) What is the energy of the electron, and how does it compare with the energy of the photon? Finding the photon momentum is a straightforward application of its definition: p=hλp=hλ. If we find the photon momentum is small, then we can assume that an electron with the same momentum will be nonrelativistic, making it easy to find its velocity and kinetic energy from the classical formulas. p=hλp=hλ Photon momentum is given by the equation: 29.23 Entering the given photon wavelength yields 29.24 Since this momentum is indeed small, we will use the classical expression p=mvp=mv to find the velocity of an electron with this momentum. Solving for vv and using the known value for the mass of an electron gives p=mvp=mv vv 29.25 The electron has kinetic energy, which is classically given by 29.26 Thus, 29.27 Converting this to eV by multiplying by (1 eV)/(1.602×10–19J)(1 eV)/(1.602×10–19J) yields (1 eV)/(1.602×10–19J)(1 eV)/(1.602×10–19J) 29.28 The photon energy EE is EE 29.29 which is about five orders of magnitude greater. Photon momentum is indeed small. Even if we have huge numbers of them, the total momentum they carry is small. An electron with the same momentum has a 1460 m/s velocity, which is clearly nonrelativistic. A more massive particle with the same momentum would have an even smaller velocity. This is borne out by the fact that it takes far less energy to give an electron the same momentum as a photon. But on a quantum-mechanical scale, especially for high-energy photons interacting with small masses, photon momentum is significant. Even on a large scale, photon momentum can have an effect if there are enough of them and if there is nothing to prevent the slow recoil of matter. Comet tails are one example, but there are also proposals to build space sails that use huge low-mass mirrors (made of aluminized Mylar) to reflect sunlight. In the vacuum of space, the mirrors would gradually recoil and could actually take spacecraft from place to place in the solar system. (See Figure 29.16.) Figure 29.16 (a) Space sails have been proposed that use the momentum of sunlight reflecting from gigantic low-mass sails to propel spacecraft about the solar system. A Russian test model of this (the Cosmos 1) was launched in 2005, but did not make it into orbit due to a rocket failure. (b) A U.S. version of this, labeled LightSail-1, is scheduled for trial launches in the first part of this decade. It will have a 40-m2 sail. (credit: Kim Newton/NASA)"

Page 346,"In 1923 a French physics graduate student named Prince Louis-Victor de Broglie (1892–1987) made a radical proposal based on the hope that nature is symmetric. If EM radiation has both particle and wave properties, then nature would be symmetric if matter also had both particle and wave properties. If what we once thought of as an unequivocal wave (EM radiation) is also a particle, then what we think of as an unequivocal particle (matter) may also be a wave. De Broglie’s suggestion, made as part of his doctoral thesis, was so radical that it was greeted with some skepticism. A copy of his thesis was sent to Einstein, who said it was not only probably correct, but that it might be of fundamental importance. With the support of Einstein and a few other prominent physicists, de Broglie was awarded his doctorate. De Broglie took both relativity and quantum mechanics into account to develop the proposal that all particles have a wavelength, given by 29.34 where hh is Planck’s constant and pp is momentum. This is defined to be the de Broglie wavelength. (Note that we already have this for photons, from the equation p=h/λp=h/λ.) The hallmark of a wave is interference. If matter is a wave, then it must exhibit constructive and destructive interference. Why isn’t this ordinarily observed? The answer is that in order to see significant interference effects, a wave must interact with an object about the same size as its wavelength. Since hh is very small, λλ is also small, especially for macroscopic objects. A 3-kg bowling ball moving at 10 m/s, for example, has hh pp de Broglie wavelength p=h/λp=h/λ hh λλ 29.35 This means that to see its wave characteristics, the bowling ball would have to interact with something about  10–35 m 10–35 m in size—far smaller than anything known. When waves interact with objects much larger than their wavelength, they show negligible interference effects and move in straight lines (such as light rays in geometric optics). To get easily observed interference effects from particles of matter, the longest wavelength and hence smallest mass possible would be useful. Therefore, this effect was first observed with electrons. 10–35 m 10–35 m American physicists Clinton J. Davisson and Lester H. Germer in 1925 and, independently, British physicist G. P. Thomson (son of J. J. Thomson, discoverer of the electron) in 1926 scattered electrons from crystals and found diffraction patterns. These patterns are exactly consistent with interference of electrons having the de Broglie wavelength and are somewhat analogous to light interacting with a diffraction grating. (See Figure 29.18.) Connections: Waves All microscopic particles, whether massless, like photons, or having mass, like electrons, have wave properties. The relationship between momentum and wavelength is fundamental for all particles. De Broglie’s proposal of a wave nature for all particles initiated a remarkably productive era in which the foundations for quantum mechanics were laid. In 1926, the Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger (1887–1961) published four papers in which the wave nature of particles was treated explicitly with wave equations. At the same time, many others began important work. Among them was German physicist Werner Heisenberg (1901–1976) who, among many other contributions to quantum mechanics, formulated a mathematical treatment of the wave nature of matter that used matrices rather than wave equations. We will deal with some specifics in later sections, but it is worth noting that de Broglie’s work was a watershed for the development of quantum mechanics. De Broglie was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1929 for his vision, as were Davisson and G. P. Thomson in 1937 for their experimental verification of de Broglie’s hypothesis. Figure 29.18 This diffraction pattern was obtained for electrons diffracted by crystalline silicon. Bright regions are those of constructive interference, while dark regions are those of destructive interference. (credit: Ndthe, Wikimedia Commons) Example 29.7 For an electron having a de Broglie wavelength of 0.167 nm (appropriate for interacting with crystal lattice structures that are about this size): (a) Calculate the electron’s velocity, assuming it is nonrelativistic. (b) Calculate the electron’s kinetic energy in eV. For part (a), since the de Broglie wavelength is given, the electron’s velocity can be obtained from λ=h/pλ=h/p by using the nonrelativistic formula for momentum, p=mv.p=mv. For part (b), once vv is obtained (and it has been verified that vv is nonrelativistic), the classical kinetic energy is simply (1/2)mv2.(1/2)mv2. λ=h/pλ=h/p p=mv.p=mv. vv vv (1/2)mv2.(1/2)mv2. Substituting the nonrelativistic formula for momentum (p=mvp=mv) into the de Broglie wavelength gives p=mvp=mv 29.36 Solving for vv gives vv 29.37 Substituting known values yields 29.38 While fast compared with a car, this electron’s speed is not highly relativistic, and so we can comfortably use the classical formula to find the electron’s kinetic energy and convert it to eV as requested. 29.39 This low energy means that these 0.167-nm electrons could be obtained by accelerating them through a 54.0-V electrostatic potential, an easy task. The results also confirm the assumption that the electrons are nonrelativistic, since their velocity is just over 1% of the speed of light and the kinetic energy is about 0.01% of the rest energy of an electron (0.511 MeV). If the electrons had turned out to be relativistic, we would have had to use more involved calculations employing relativistic formulas."

Page 346,"One consequence or use of the wave nature of matter is found in the electron microscope. As we have discussed, there is a limit to the detail observed with any probe having a wavelength. Resolution, or observable detail, is limited to about one wavelength. Since a potential of only 54 V can produce electrons with sub-nanometer wavelengths, it is easy to get electrons with much smaller wavelengths than those of visible light (hundreds of nanometers). Electron microscopes can, thus, be constructed to detect much smaller details than optical microscopes. (See Figure 29.19.) There are basically two types of electron microscopes. The transmission electron microscope (TEM) accelerates electrons that are emitted from a hot filament (the cathode). The beam is broadened and then passes through the sample. A magnetic lens focuses the beam image onto a fluorescent screen, a photographic plate, or (most probably) a CCD (light sensitive camera), from which it is transferred to a computer. The TEM is similar to the optical microscope, but it requires a thin sample examined in a vacuum. However it can resolve details as small as 0.1 nm (10−10m10−10m), providing magnifications of 100 million times the size of the original object. The TEM has allowed us to see individual atoms and structure of cell nuclei. 10−10m10−10m The scanning electron microscope (SEM) provides images by using secondary electrons produced by the primary beam interacting with the surface of the sample (see Figure 29.19). The SEM also uses magnetic lenses to focus the beam onto the sample. However, it moves the beam around electrically to “scan” the sample in the x and y directions. A CCD detector is used to process the data for each electron position, producing images like the one at the beginning of this chapter. The SEM has the advantage of not requiring a thin sample and of providing a 3-D view. However, its resolution is about ten times less than a TEM. Figure 29.19 Schematic of a scanning electron microscope (SEM) (a) used to observe small details, such as those seen in this image of a tooth of a Himipristis, a type of shark (b). (credit: Dallas Krentzel, Flickr) Electrons were the first particles with mass to be directly confirmed to have the wavelength proposed by de Broglie. Subsequently, protons, helium nuclei, neutrons, and many others have been observed to exhibit interference when they interact with objects having sizes similar to their de Broglie wavelength. The de Broglie wavelength for massless particles was well established in the 1920s for photons, and it has since been observed that all massless particles have a de Broglie wavelength λ=h/p.λ=h/p. The wave nature of all particles is a universal characteristic of nature. We shall see in following sections that implications of the de Broglie wavelength include the quantization of energy in atoms and molecules, and an alteration of our basic view of nature on the microscopic scale. The next section, for example, shows that there are limits to the precision with which we may make predictions, regardless of how hard we try. There are even limits to the precision with which we may measure an object’s location or energy. λ=h/p.λ=h/p. Making Connections: A Submicroscopic Diffraction Grating The wave nature of matter allows it to exhibit all the characteristics of other, more familiar, waves. Diffraction gratings, for example, produce diffraction patterns for light that depend on grating spacing and the wavelength of the light. This effect, as with most wave phenomena, is most pronounced when the wave interacts with objects having a size similar to its wavelength. For gratings, this is the spacing between multiple slits.) When electrons interact with a system having a spacing similar to the electron wavelength, they show the same types of interference patterns as light does for diffraction gratings, as shown at top left in Figure 29.20. Atoms are spaced at regular intervals in a crystal as parallel planes, as shown in the bottom part of Figure 29.20. The spacings between these planes act like the openings in a diffraction grating. At certain incident angles, the paths of electrons scattering from successive planes differ by one wavelength and, thus, interfere constructively. At other angles, the path length differences are not an integral wavelength, and there is partial to total destructive interference. This type of scattering from a large crystal with well-defined lattice planes can produce dramatic interference patterns. It is called Bragg reflection, for the father-and-son team who first explored and analyzed it in some detail. The expanded view also shows the path-length differences and indicates how these depend on incident angle θθ in a manner similar to the diffraction patterns for x rays reflecting from a crystal. θθ Figure 29.20 The diffraction pattern at top left is produced by scattering electrons from a crystal and is graphed as a function of incident angle relative to the regular array of atoms in a crystal, as shown at bottom. Electrons scattering from the second layer of atoms travel farther than those scattered from the top layer. If the path length difference (PLD) is an integral wavelength, there is constructive interference. Let us take the spacing between parallel planes of atoms in the crystal to be dd. As mentioned, if the path length difference (PLD) for the electrons is a whole number of wavelengths, there will be constructive interference—that is, PLD=nλ (n= 1, 2, 3,…)PLD=nλ (n= 1, 2, 3,…). Because AB=BC=
dsinθ,AB=BC=
dsinθ, we have constructive interference when
nλ=2dsinθ.nλ=2dsinθ. This relationship is called the Bragg equation and applies not only to electrons but also to x rays. dd PLD=nλ (n= 1, 2, 3,…)PLD=nλ (n= 1, 2, 3,…) AB=BC=
dsinθ,AB=BC=
dsinθ, nλ=2dsinθ.nλ=2dsinθ. The wavelength of matter is a submicroscopic characteristic that explains a macroscopic phenomenon such as Bragg reflection. Similarly, the wavelength of light is a submicroscopic characteristic that explains the macroscopic phenomenon of diffraction patterns."

Page 347,"Matter and photons are waves, implying they are spread out over some distance. What is the position of a particle, such as an electron? Is it at the center of the wave? The answer lies in how you measure the position of an electron. Experiments show that you will find the electron at some definite location, unlike a wave. But if you set up exactly the same situation and measure it again, you will find the electron in a different location, often far outside any experimental uncertainty in your measurement. Repeated measurements will display a statistical distribution of locations that appears wavelike. (See Figure 29.21.) Figure 29.21 The building up of the diffraction pattern of electrons scattered from a crystal surface. Each electron arrives at a definite location, which cannot be precisely predicted. The overall distribution shown at the bottom can be predicted as the diffraction of waves having the de Broglie wavelength of the electrons. Figure 29.22 Double-slit interference for electrons (a) and photons (b) is identical for equal wavelengths and equal slit separations. Both patterns are probability distributions in the sense that they are built up by individual particles traversing the apparatus, the paths of which are not individually predictable. After de Broglie proposed the wave nature of matter, many physicists, including Schrödinger and Heisenberg, explored the consequences. The idea quickly emerged that, because of its wave character, a particle’s trajectory and destination cannot be precisely predicted for each particle individually. However, each particle goes to a definite place (as illustrated in Figure 29.21). After compiling enough data, you get a distribution related to the particle’s wavelength and diffraction pattern. There is a certain probability of finding the particle at a given location, and the overall pattern is called a probability distribution. Those who developed quantum mechanics devised equations that predicted the probability distribution in various circumstances. probability distribution It is somewhat disquieting to think that you cannot predict exactly where an individual particle will go, or even follow it to its destination. Let us explore what happens if we try to follow a particle. Consider the double-slit patterns obtained for electrons and photons in Figure 29.22. First, we note that these patterns are identical, following dsinθ=mλdsinθ=mλ, the equation for double-slit constructive interference developed in Photon Energies and the Electromagnetic Spectrum, where dd is the slit separation and λλ is the electron or photon wavelength. dsinθ=mλdsinθ=mλ dd λλ Both patterns build up statistically as individual particles fall on the detector. This can be observed for photons or electrons—for now, let us concentrate on electrons. You might imagine that the electrons are interfering with one another as any waves do. To test this, you can lower the intensity until there is never more than one electron between the slits and the screen. The same interference pattern builds up! This implies that a particle’s probability distribution spans both slits, and the particles actually interfere with themselves. Does this also mean that the electron goes through both slits? An electron is a basic unit of matter that is not divisible. But it is a fair question, and so we should look to see if the electron traverses one slit or the other, or both. One possibility is to have coils around the slits that detect charges moving through them. What is observed is that an electron always goes through one slit or the other; it does not split to go through both. But there is a catch. If you determine that the electron went through one of the slits, you no longer get a double slit pattern—instead, you get single slit interference. There is no escape by using another method of determining which slit the electron went through. Knowing the particle went through one slit forces a single-slit pattern. If you do not observe which slit the electron goes through, you obtain a double-slit pattern."
Page 347,"How does knowing which slit the electron passed through change the pattern? The answer is fundamentally important—measurement affects the system being observed. Information can be lost, and in some cases it is impossible to measure two physical quantities simultaneously to exact precision. For example, you can measure the position of a moving electron by scattering light or other electrons from it. Those probes have momentum themselves, and by scattering from the electron, they change its momentum in a manner that loses information. There is a limit to absolute knowledge, even in principle. Figure 29.23 Werner Heisenberg was one of the best of those physicists who developed early quantum mechanics. Not only did his work enable a description of nature on the very small scale, it also changed our view of the availability of knowledge. Although he is universally recognized for his brilliance and the importance of his work (he received the Nobel Prize in 1932, for example), Heisenberg remained in Germany during World War II and headed the German effort to build a nuclear bomb, permanently alienating himself from most of the scientific community. (credit: Author Unknown, via Wikimedia Commons) It was Werner Heisenberg who first stated this limit to knowledge in 1929 as a result of his work on quantum mechanics and the wave characteristics of all particles. (See Figure 29.23). Specifically, consider simultaneously measuring the position and momentum of an electron (it could be any particle). There is an uncertainty in position ΔxΔx that is approximately equal to the wavelength of the particle. That is, uncertainty in position ΔxΔx 29.40 As discussed above, a wave is not located at one point in space. If the electron’s position is measured repeatedly, a spread in locations will be observed, implying an uncertainty in position ΔxΔx. To detect the position of the particle, we must interact with it, such as having it collide with a detector. In the collision, the particle will lose momentum. This change in momentum could be anywhere from close to zero to the total momentum of the particle, p=h/λp=h/λ. It is not possible to tell how much momentum will be transferred to a detector, and so there is an uncertainty in momentum ΔpΔp, too. In fact, the uncertainty in momentum may be as large as the momentum itself, which in equation form means that ΔxΔx p=h/λp=h/λ uncertainty in momentum ΔpΔp 29.41 The uncertainty in position can be reduced by using a shorter-wavelength electron, since Δx≈λΔx≈λ. But shortening the wavelength increases the uncertainty in momentum, since Δp≈h/λΔp≈h/λ. Conversely, the uncertainty in momentum can be reduced by using a longer-wavelength electron, but this increases the uncertainty in position. Mathematically, you can express this trade-off by multiplying the uncertainties. The wavelength cancels, leaving Δx≈λΔx≈λ Δp≈h/λΔp≈h/λ 29.42 So if one uncertainty is reduced, the other must increase so that their product is ≈h≈h. ≈h≈h With the use of advanced mathematics, Heisenberg showed that the best that can be done in a simultaneous measurement of position and momentum is 29.43 This is known as the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. It is impossible to measure position xx and momentum pp simultaneously with uncertainties ΔxΔx and ΔpΔp that multiply to be less than h/4πh/4π. Neither uncertainty can be zero. Neither uncertainty can become small without the other becoming large. A small wavelength allows accurate position measurement, but it increases the momentum of the probe to the point that it further disturbs the momentum of a system being measured. For example, if an electron is scattered from an atom and has a wavelength small enough to detect the position of electrons in the atom, its momentum can knock the electrons from their orbits in a manner that loses information about their original motion. It is therefore impossible to follow an electron in its orbit around an atom. If you measure the electron’s position, you will find it in a definite location, but the atom will be disrupted. Repeated measurements on identical atoms will produce interesting probability distributions for electrons around the atom, but they will not produce motion information. The probability distributions are referred to as electron clouds or orbitals. The shapes of these orbitals are often shown in general chemistry texts and are discussed in The Wave Nature of Matter Causes Quantization. Heisenberg uncertainty principle xx pp ΔxΔx ΔpΔp h/4πh/4π Example 29.8 (a) If the position of an electron in an atom is measured to an accuracy of 0.0100 nm, what is the electron’s uncertainty in velocity? (b) If the electron has this velocity, what is its kinetic energy in eV? The uncertainty in position is the accuracy of the measurement, or Δx=0.0100nmΔx=0.0100nm. Thus the smallest uncertainty in momentum ΔpΔp can be calculated using ΔxΔp≥h/4πΔxΔp≥h/4π. Once the uncertainty in momentum ΔpΔp is found, the uncertainty in velocity can be found from Δp=mΔvΔp=mΔv. Δx=0.0100nmΔx=0.0100nm ΔpΔp ΔxΔp≥h/4πΔxΔp≥h/4π ΔpΔp Δp=mΔvΔp=mΔv Using the equals sign in the uncertainty principle to express the minimum uncertainty, we have 29.44 Solving for ΔpΔp and substituting known values gives ΔpΔp 29.45 Thus, 29.46 Solving for ΔvΔv and substituting the mass of an electron gives ΔvΔv 29.47 Although large, this velocity is not highly relativistic, and so the electron’s kinetic energy is 29.48 Since atoms are roughly 0.1 nm in size, knowing the position of an electron to 0.0100 nm localizes it reasonably well inside the atom. This would be like being able to see details one-tenth the size of the atom. But the consequent uncertainty in velocity is large. You certainly could not follow it very well if its velocity is so uncertain. To get a further idea of how large the uncertainty in velocity is, we assumed the velocity of the electron was equal to its uncertainty and found this gave a kinetic energy of 95.5 eV. This is significantly greater than the typical energy difference between levels in atoms (see Table 29.1), so that it is impossible to get a meaningful energy for the electron if we know its position even moderately well. Why don’t we notice Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle in everyday life? The answer is that Planck’s constant is very small. Thus the lower limit in the uncertainty of measuring the position and momentum of large objects is negligible. We can detect sunlight reflected from Jupiter and follow the planet in its orbit around the Sun. The reflected sunlight alters the momentum of Jupiter and creates an uncertainty in its momentum, but this is totally negligible compared with Jupiter’s huge momentum. The correspondence principle tells us that the predictions of quantum mechanics become indistinguishable from classical physics for large objects, which is the case here."

Page 347,"There is another form of Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle for simultaneous measurements of energy and time. In equation form, Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle 29.49 where ΔEΔE is the uncertainty in energy and ΔtΔt is the uncertainty in time. This means that within a time interval ΔtΔt, it is not possible to measure energy precisely—there will be an uncertainty ΔEΔE in the measurement. In order to measure energy more precisely (to make ΔEΔE smaller), we must increase ΔtΔt. This time interval may be the amount of time we take to make the measurement, or it could be the amount of time a particular state exists, as in the next Example 29.9. ΔEΔE uncertainty in energy ΔtΔt uncertainty in time ΔtΔt ΔEΔE ΔEΔE ΔtΔt Example 29.9 An atom in an excited state temporarily stores energy. If the lifetime of this excited state is measured to be 1.0×10−10s1.0×10−10s, what is the minimum uncertainty in the energy of the state in eV? 1.0×10−10s1.0×10−10s The minimum uncertainty in energy ΔEΔE is found by using the equals sign in ΔEΔt≥h/4πΔEΔt≥h/4π and corresponds to a reasonable choice for the uncertainty in time. The largest the uncertainty in time can be is the full lifetime of the excited state, or Δt=1.0×10−10sΔt=1.0×10−10s. ΔEΔE ΔEΔt≥h/4πΔEΔt≥h/4π Δt=1.0×10−10sΔt=1.0×10−10s Solving the uncertainty principle for ΔEΔE and substituting known values gives ΔEΔE 29.50 Now converting to eV yields 29.51 The lifetime of 10−10s10−10s is typical of excited states in atoms—on human time scales, they quickly emit their stored energy. An uncertainty in energy of only a few millionths of an eV results. This uncertainty is small compared with typical excitation energies in atoms, which are on the order of 1 eV. So here the uncertainty principle limits the accuracy with which we can measure the lifetime and energy of such states, but not very significantly. 10−10s10−10s The uncertainty principle for energy and time can be of great significance if the lifetime of a system is very short. Then ΔtΔt is very small, and ΔEΔE is consequently very large. Some nuclei and exotic particles have extremely short lifetimes (as small as 10−25s10−25s), causing uncertainties in energy as great as many GeV (109eV109eV). Stored energy appears as increased rest mass, and so this means that there is significant uncertainty in the rest mass of short-lived particles. When measured repeatedly, a spread of masses or decay energies are obtained. The spread is ΔEΔE. You might ask whether this uncertainty in energy could be avoided by not measuring the lifetime. The answer is no. Nature knows the lifetime, and so its brevity affects the energy of the particle. This is so well established experimentally that the uncertainty in decay energy is used to calculate the lifetime of short-lived states. Some nuclei and particles are so short-lived that it is difficult to measure their lifetime. But if their decay energy can be measured, its spread is ΔEΔE, and this is used in the uncertainty principle (ΔEΔt≥h/4πΔEΔt≥h/4π) to calculate the lifetime ΔtΔt. ΔtΔt ΔEΔE 10−25s10−25s 109eV109eV ΔEΔE ΔEΔE ΔEΔt≥h/4πΔEΔt≥h/4π ΔtΔt There is another consequence of the uncertainty principle for energy and time. If energy is uncertain by ΔEΔE, then conservation of energy can be violated by ΔEΔE for a time ΔtΔt. Neither the physicist nor nature can tell that conservation of energy has been violated, if the violation is temporary and smaller than the uncertainty in energy. While this sounds innocuous enough, we shall see in later chapters that it allows the temporary creation of matter from nothing and has implications for how nature transmits forces over very small distances. ΔEΔE ΔEΔE ΔtΔt Finally, note that in the discussion of particles and waves, we have stated that individual measurements produce precise or particle-like results. A definite position is determined each time we observe an electron, for example. But repeated measurements produce a spread in values consistent with wave characteristics. The great theoretical physicist Richard Feynman (1918–1988) commented, “What there are, are particles.” When you observe enough of them, they distribute themselves as you would expect for a wave phenomenon. However, what there are as they travel we cannot tell because, when we do try to measure, we affect the traveling."

Page 348,"The problem set for this section involves concepts from this chapter and several others. Physics is most interesting when applied to general situations involving more than a narrow set of physical principles. For example, photons have momentum, hence the relevance of Linear Momentum and Collisions. The following topics are involved in some or all of the problems in this section: Problem-Solving Strategy Example 29.10 illustrates how these strategies are applied to an integrated-concept problem. Example 29.10 The following topics are involved in this integrated concepts worked example: Table 29.2 Topics A 550-nm photon (visible light) is absorbed by a 1.00-μg1.00-μg particle of dust in outer space. (a) Find the momentum of such a photon. (b) What is the recoil velocity of the particle of dust, assuming it is initially at rest? 1.00-μg1.00-μg To solve an integrated-concept problem, such as those following this example, we must first identify the physical principles involved and identify the chapters in which they are found. Part (a) of this example asks for the momentum of a photon, a topic of the present chapter. Part (b) considers recoil following a collision, a topic of Linear Momentum and Collisions. The following solutions to each part of the example illustrate how specific problem-solving strategies are applied. These involve identifying knowns and unknowns, checking to see if the answer is reasonable, and so on. The momentum of a photon is related to its wavelength by the equation: 29.52 Entering the known value for Planck’s constant hh and given the wavelength λλ, we obtain hh λλ 29.53 This momentum is small, as expected from discussions in the text and the fact that photons of visible light carry small amounts of energy and momentum compared with those carried by macroscopic objects. Conservation of momentum in the absorption of this photon by a grain of dust can be analyzed using the equation: 29.54 The net external force is zero, since the dust is in outer space. Let 1 represent the photon and 2 the dust particle. Before the collision, the dust is at rest (relative to some observer); after the collision, there is no photon (it is absorbed). So conservation of momentum can be written 29.55 where p1p1 is the photon momentum before the collision and p′2p′2 is the dust momentum after the collision. The mass and recoil velocity of the dust are mm and vv, respectively. Solving this for vv, the requested quantity, yields p1p1 p′2p′2 mm vv vv 29.56 where pp is the photon momentum found in part (a). Entering known values (noting that a microgram is 10−9 kg10−9 kg) gives pp 10−9 kg10−9 kg 29.57 The recoil velocity of the particle of dust is extremely small. As we have noted, however, there are immense numbers of photons in sunlight and other macroscopic sources. In time, collisions and absorption of many photons could cause a significant recoil of the dust, as observed in comet tails."

Page 355,"Gas discharge tubes, such as that shown in Figure 30.4, consist of an evacuated glass tube containing two metal electrodes and a rarefied gas. When a high voltage is applied to the electrodes, the gas glows. These tubes were the precursors to today’s neon lights. They were first studied seriously by Heinrich Geissler, a German inventor and glassblower, starting in the 1860s. The English scientist William Crookes, among others, continued to study what for some time were called Crookes tubes, wherein electrons are freed from atoms and molecules in the rarefied gas inside the tube and are accelerated from the cathode (negative) to the anode (positive) by the high potential. These “cathode rays” collide with the gas atoms and molecules and excite them, resulting in the emission of electromagnetic (EM) radiation that makes the electrons’ path visible as a ray that spreads and fades as it moves away from the cathode. Gas discharge tubes today are most commonly called cathode-ray tubes, because the rays originate at the cathode. Crookes showed that the electrons carry momentum (they can make a small paddle wheel rotate). He also found that their normally straight path is bent by a magnet in the direction expected for a negative charge moving away from the cathode. These were the first direct indications of electrons and their charge. cathode-ray tubes Figure 30.4 A gas discharge tube glows when a high voltage is applied to it. Electrons emitted from the cathode are accelerated toward the anode; they excite atoms and molecules in the gas, which glow in response. Once called Geissler tubes and later Crookes tubes, they are now known as cathode-ray tubes (CRTs) and are found in older TVs, computer screens, and x-ray machines. When a magnetic field is applied, the beam bends in the direction expected for negative charge. (credit: Paul Downey, Flickr) The English physicist J. J. Thomson (1856–1940) improved and expanded the scope of experiments with gas discharge tubes. (See Figure 30.5 and Figure 30.6.) He verified the negative charge of the cathode rays with both magnetic and electric fields. Additionally, he collected the rays in a metal cup and found an excess of negative charge. Thomson was also able to measure the ratio of the charge of the electron to its mass, qeqe/me/me—an important step to finding the actual values of both qeqe and meme. Figure 30.7 shows a cathode-ray tube, which produces a narrow beam of electrons that passes through charging plates connected to a high-voltage power supply. An electric field EE  is produced between the charging plates, and the cathode-ray tube is placed between the poles of a magnet so that the  electric field EE is perpendicular to the magnetic field BB of the magnet. These fields, being perpendicular to each other, produce opposing forces on the electrons. As discussed for mass spectrometers in More Applications of Magnetism, if the net force due to the fields vanishes, then the velocity of the charged particle is v=E/Bv=E/B. In this manner, Thomson determined the velocity of the electrons and then moved the beam up and down by adjusting the electric field. qeqe /me/me qeqe meme EE EE BB v=E/Bv=E/B Figure 30.5 J. J. Thomson (credit: www.firstworldwar.com, via Wikimedia Commons) Figure 30.6 Diagram of Thomson’s CRT. (credit: Kurzon, Wikimedia Commons) Figure 30.7 This schematic shows the electron beam in a CRT passing through crossed electric and magnetic fields and causing phosphor to glow when striking the end of the tube. To see how the amount of deflection is used to calculate qe/meqe/me, note that the deflection is proportional to the electric force on the electron: qe/meqe/me 30.1 But the vertical deflection is also related to the electron’s mass, since the electron’s acceleration is 30.2 The value of FF is not known, since qeqe was not yet known. Substituting the expression for electric force into the expression for acceleration yields FF qeqe 30.3 Gathering terms, we have 30.4 The deflection is analyzed to get aa, and EE is determined from the applied voltage and distance between the plates; thus, qemeqeme can be determined. With the velocity known, another measurement of qemeqeme can be obtained by bending the beam of electrons with the magnetic field. Since Fmag=qevB=meaFmag=qevB=mea, we have qe/me=a/vBqe/me=a/vB. Consistent results are obtained using magnetic deflection. aa EE qemeqeme qemeqeme Fmag=qevB=meaFmag=qevB=mea qe/me=a/vBqe/me=a/vB What is so important about qe/meqe/me, the ratio of the electron’s charge to its mass? The value obtained is qe/meqe/me 30.5 This is a huge number, as Thomson realized, and it implies that the electron has a very small mass. It was known from electroplating that about 108 C/kg108 C/kg is needed to plate a material, a factor of about 1000 less than the charge per kilogram of electrons. Thomson went on to do the same experiment for positively charged hydrogen ions (now known to be bare protons) and found a charge per kilogram about 1000 times smaller than that for the electron, implying that the proton is about 1000 times more massive than the electron. Today, we know more precisely that 108 C/kg108 C/kg 30.6 where qpqp is the charge of the proton and mpmp is its mass. This ratio (to four significant figures) is 1836 times less charge per kilogram than for the electron. Since the charges of electrons and protons are equal in magnitude, this implies mp=1836memp=1836me . qpqp mpmp mp=1836memp=1836me Thomson performed a variety of experiments using differing gases in discharge tubes and employing other methods, such as the photoelectric effect, for freeing electrons from atoms. He always found the same properties for the electron, proving it to be an independent particle. For his work, the important pieces of which he began to publish in 1897, Thomson was awarded the 1906 Nobel Prize in Physics. In retrospect, it is difficult to appreciate how astonishing it was to find that the atom has a substructure. Thomson himself said, “It was only when I was convinced that the experiment left no escape from it that I published my belief in the existence of bodies smaller than atoms.” Thomson attempted to measure the charge of individual electrons, but his method could determine its charge only to the order of magnitude expected. Since Faraday’s experiments with electroplating in the 1830s, it had been known that about 100,000 C per mole was needed to plate singly ionized ions. Dividing this by the number of ions per mole (that is, by Avogadro’s number), which was approximately known, the charge per ion was calculated to be about 1.6×10−19 C1.6×10−19 C, close to the actual value. 1.6×10−19 C1.6×10−19 C An American physicist, Robert Millikan (1868–1953) (see Figure 30.8), decided to improve upon Thomson’s experiment for measuring qeqe and was eventually forced to try another approach, which is now a classic experiment performed by students. The Millikan oil drop experiment is shown in Figure 30.9. qeqe Figure 30.8 Robert Millikan (credit: Unknown Author, via Wikimedia Commons) Figure 30.9 The Millikan oil drop experiment produced the first accurate direct measurement of the charge on electrons, one of the most fundamental constants in nature. Fine drops of oil become charged when sprayed. Their movement is observed between metal plates with a potential applied to oppose the gravitational force. The balance of gravitational and electric forces allows the calculation of the charge on a drop. The charge is found to be quantized in units of

, thus determining directly the charge of the excess and missing electrons on the oil drops. In the Millikan oil drop experiment, fine drops of oil are sprayed from an atomizer. Some of these are charged by the process and can then be suspended between metal plates by a voltage between the plates. In this situation, the weight of the drop is balanced by the electric force: 30.7 The electric field is produced by the applied voltage, hence, E=V/dE=V/d, and VV is adjusted to just balance the drop’s weight. The drops can be seen as points of reflected light using a microscope, but they are too small to directly measure their size and mass. The mass of the drop is determined by observing how fast it falls when the voltage is turned off. Since air resistance is very significant for these submicroscopic drops, the more massive drops fall faster than the less massive, and sophisticated sedimentation calculations can reveal their mass. Oil is used rather than water, because it does not readily evaporate, and so mass is nearly constant. Once the mass of the drop is known, the charge of the electron is given by rearranging the previous equation: E=V/dE=V/d VV 30.8 where dd is the separation of the plates and VV is the voltage that holds the drop motionless. (The same drop can be observed for several hours to see that it really is motionless.) By 1913 Millikan had measured the charge of the electron qeqe to an accuracy of 1%, and he improved this by a factor of 10 within a few years to a value of −1.60×10−19 C−1.60×10−19 C. He also observed that all charges were multiples of the basic electron charge and that sudden changes could occur in which electrons were added or removed from the drops. For this very fundamental direct measurement of qeqe and for his studies of the photoelectric effect, Millikan was awarded the 1923 Nobel Prize in Physics. dd VV qeqe −1.60×10−19 C−1.60×10−19 C qeqe With the charge of the electron known and the charge-to-mass ratio known, the electron’s mass can be calculated. It is 30.9 Substituting known values yields 30.10 or 30.11 where the round-off errors have been corrected. The mass of the electron has been verified in many subsequent experiments and is now known to an accuracy of better than one part in one million. It is an incredibly small mass and remains the smallest known mass of any particle that has mass. (Some particles, such as photons, are massless and cannot be brought to rest, but travel at the speed of light.) A similar calculation gives the masses of other particles, including the proton. To three digits, the mass of the proton is now known to be 30.12 which is nearly identical to the mass of a hydrogen atom. What Thomson and Millikan had done was to prove the existence of one substructure of atoms, the electron, and further to show that it had only a tiny fraction of the mass of an atom. The nucleus of an atom contains most of its mass, and the nature of the nucleus was completely unanticipated. Another important characteristic of quantum mechanics was also beginning to emerge. All electrons are identical to one another. The charge and mass of electrons are not average values; rather, they are unique values that all electrons have. This is true of other fundamental entities at the submicroscopic level. All protons are identical to one another, and so on."
Page 355,"Here, we examine the first direct evidence of the size and mass of the nucleus. In later chapters, we will examine many other aspects of nuclear physics, but the basic information on nuclear size and mass is so important to understanding the atom that we consider it here. Nuclear radioactivity was discovered in 1896, and it was soon the subject of intense study by a number of the best scientists in the world. Among them was New Zealander Lord Ernest Rutherford, who made numerous fundamental discoveries and earned the title of “father of nuclear physics.” Born in Nelson, Rutherford did his postgraduate studies at the Cavendish Laboratories in England before taking up a position at McGill University in Canada where he did the work that earned him a Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1908. In the area of atomic and nuclear physics, there is much overlap between chemistry and physics, with physics providing the fundamental enabling theories. He returned to England in later years and had six future Nobel Prize winners as students. Rutherford used nuclear radiation to directly examine the size and mass of the atomic nucleus. The experiment he devised is shown in Figure 30.10. A radioactive source that emits alpha radiation was placed in a lead container with a hole in one side to produce a beam of alpha particles, which are a type of ionizing radiation ejected by the nuclei of a radioactive source. A thin gold foil was placed in the beam, and the scattering of the alpha particles was observed by the glow they caused when they struck a phosphor screen. Figure 30.10 Rutherford’s experiment gave direct evidence for the size and mass of the nucleus by scattering alpha particles from a thin gold foil. Alpha particles with energies of about 5 MeV5 MeV are emitted from a radioactive source (which is a small metal container in which a specific amount of a radioactive material is sealed), are collimated into a beam, and fall upon the foil. The number of particles that penetrate the foil or scatter to various angles indicates that gold nuclei are very small and contain nearly all of the gold atom’s mass. This is particularly indicated by the alpha particles that scatter to very large angles, much like a soccer ball bouncing off a goalie’s head. Alpha particles were known to be the doubly charged positive nuclei of helium atoms that had kinetic energies on the order of 5 MeV5 MeV when emitted in nuclear decay, which is the disintegration of the nucleus of an unstable nuclide by the spontaneous emission of charged particles. These particles interact with matter mostly via the Coulomb force, and the manner in which they scatter from nuclei can reveal nuclear size and mass. This is analogous to observing how a bowling ball is scattered by an object you cannot see directly. Because the alpha particle’s energy is so large compared with the typical energies associated with atoms (MeVMeV versus eVeV), you would expect the alpha particles to simply crash through a thin foil much like a supersonic bowling ball would crash through a few dozen rows of bowling pins. Thomson had envisioned the atom to be a small sphere in which equal amounts of positive and negative charge were distributed evenly. The incident massive alpha particles would suffer only small deflections in such a model. Instead, Rutherford and his collaborators found that alpha particles occasionally were scattered to large angles, some even back in the direction from which they came! Detailed analysis using conservation of momentum and energy—particularly of the small number that came straight back—implied that gold nuclei are very small compared with the size of a gold atom, contain almost all of the atom’s mass, and are tightly bound. Since the gold nucleus is several times more massive than the alpha particle, a head-on collision would scatter the alpha particle straight back toward the source. In addition, the smaller the nucleus, the fewer alpha particles that would hit one head on. 5 MeV5 MeV MeVMeV eVeV Although the results of the experiment were published by his colleagues in 1909, it took Rutherford two years to convince himself of their meaning. Like Thomson before him, Rutherford was reluctant to accept such radical results. Nature on a small scale is so unlike our classical world that even those at the forefront of discovery are sometimes surprised. Rutherford later wrote: “It was almost as incredible as if you fired a 15-inch shell at a piece of tissue paper and it came back and hit you. On consideration, I realized that this scattering backwards ... [meant] ... the greatest part of the mass of the atom was concentrated in a tiny nucleus.” In 1911, Rutherford published his analysis together with a proposed model of the atom. The size of the nucleus was determined to be about 10−15 m10−15 m, or 100,000 times smaller than the atom. This implies a huge density, on the order of 1015 g/cm31015 g/cm3, vastly unlike any macroscopic matter. Also implied is the existence of previously unknown nuclear forces to counteract the huge repulsive Coulomb forces among the positive charges in the nucleus. Huge forces would also be consistent with the large energies emitted in nuclear radiation. 10−15 m10−15 m 1015 g/cm31015 g/cm3 The small size of the nucleus also implies that the atom is mostly empty inside. In fact, in Rutherford’s experiment, most alphas went straight through the gold foil with very little scattering, since electrons have such small masses and since the atom was mostly empty with nothing for the alpha to hit. There were already hints of this at the time Rutherford performed his experiments, since energetic electrons had been observed to penetrate thin foils more easily than expected. Figure 30.11 shows a schematic of the atoms in a thin foil with circles representing the size of the atoms (about 10−10 m10−10 m) and dots representing the nuclei. (The dots are not to scale—if they were, you would need a microscope to see them.) Most alpha particles miss the small nuclei and are only slightly scattered by electrons. Occasionally, (about once in 8000 times in Rutherford’s experiment), an alpha hits a nucleus head-on and is scattered straight backward. 10−10 m10−10 m Figure 30.11 An expanded view of the atoms in the gold foil in Rutherford’s experiment. Circles represent the atoms (about 10−10 m10−10 m in diameter), while the dots represent the nuclei (about 10−15 m10−15 m in diameter). To be visible, the dots are much larger than scale. Most alpha particles crash through but are relatively unaffected because of their high energy and the electron’s small mass. Some, however, head straight toward a nucleus and are scattered straight back. A detailed analysis gives the size and mass of the nucleus. Based on the size and mass of the nucleus revealed by his experiment, as well as the mass of electrons, Rutherford proposed the planetary model of the atom. The planetary model of the atom pictures low-mass electrons orbiting a large-mass nucleus. The sizes of the electron orbits are large compared with the size of the nucleus, with mostly vacuum inside the atom. This picture is analogous to how low-mass planets in our solar system orbit the large-mass Sun at distances large compared with the size of the sun. In the atom, the attractive Coulomb force is analogous to gravitation in the planetary system. (See Figure 30.12.) Note that a model or mental picture is needed to explain experimental results, since the atom is too small to be directly observed with visible light. planetary model of the atom Figure 30.12 Rutherford’s planetary model of the atom incorporates the characteristics of the nucleus, electrons, and the size of the atom. This model was the first to recognize the structure of atoms, in which low-mass electrons orbit a very small, massive nucleus in orbits much larger than the nucleus. The atom is mostly empty and is analogous to our planetary system. Rutherford’s planetary model of the atom was crucial to understanding the characteristics of atoms, and their interactions and energies, as we shall see in the next few sections. Also, it was an indication of how different nature is from the familiar classical world on the small, quantum mechanical scale. The discovery of a substructure to all matter in the form of atoms and molecules was now being taken a step further to reveal a substructure of atoms that was simpler than the 92 elements then known. We have continued to search for deeper substructures, such as those inside the nucleus, with some success. In later chapters, we will follow this quest in the discussion of quarks and other elementary particles, and we will look at the direction the search seems now to be heading."

Page 356,"As noted in Quantization of Energy , the energies of some small systems are quantized. Atomic and molecular emission and absorption spectra have been known for over a century to be discrete (or quantized). (See Figure 30.14.) Maxwell and others had realized that there must be a connection between the spectrum of an atom and its structure, something like the resonant frequencies of musical instruments. But, in spite of years of efforts by many great minds, no one had a workable theory. (It was a running joke that any theory of atomic and molecular spectra could be destroyed by throwing a book of data at it, so complex were the spectra.) Following Einstein’s proposal of photons with quantized energies directly proportional to their wavelengths, it became even more evident that electrons in atoms can exist only in discrete orbits. Figure 30.14 Part (a) shows, from left to right, a discharge tube, slit, and diffraction grating producing a line spectrum. Part (b) shows the emission line spectrum for iron. The discrete lines imply quantized energy states for the atoms that produce them. The line spectrum for each element is unique, providing a powerful and much used analytical tool, and many line spectra were well known for many years before they could be explained with physics. (credit for (b): Yttrium91, Wikimedia Commons) In some cases, it had been possible to devise formulas that described the emission spectra. As you might expect, the simplest atom—hydrogen, with its single electron—has a relatively simple spectrum. The hydrogen spectrum had been observed in the infrared (IR), visible, and ultraviolet (UV), and several series of spectral lines had been observed. (See Figure 30.15.) These series are named after early researchers who studied them in particular depth. The observed hydrogen-spectrum wavelengths can be calculated using the following formula: hydrogen-spectrum wavelengths 30.13 where λλ is the wavelength of the emitted EM radiation and RR is the Rydberg constant, determined by the experiment to be λλ RR Rydberg constant 30.14 The constant nfnf is a positive integer associated with a specific series. For the Lyman series, nf=1nf=1; for the Balmer series, nf=2nf=2; for the Paschen series, nf=3nf=3; and so on. The Lyman series is entirely in the UV, while part of the Balmer series is visible with the remainder UV. The Paschen series and all the rest are entirely IR. There are apparently an unlimited number of series, although they lie progressively farther into the infrared and become difficult to observe as nfnf increases. The constant nini is a positive integer, but it must be greater than nfnf. Thus, for the Balmer series, nf=2nf=2 and
ni=3, 4, 5, 6, ...ni=3, 4, 5, 6, .... Note that
nini can approach infinity. While the formula in the wavelengths equation was just a recipe designed to fit data and was not based on physical principles, it did imply a deeper meaning. Balmer first devised the formula for his series alone, and it was later found to describe all the other series by using different values of nfnf. Bohr was the first to comprehend the deeper meaning. Again, we see the interplay between experiment and theory in physics. Experimentally, the spectra were well established, an equation was found to fit the experimental data, but the theoretical foundation was missing. nfnf nf=1nf=1 nf=2nf=2 nf=3nf=3 nfnf nini nfnf nf=2nf=2 ni=3, 4, 5, 6, ...ni=3, 4, 5, 6, ... nini nfnf Figure 30.15 A schematic of the hydrogen spectrum shows several series named for those who contributed most to their determination. Part of the Balmer series is in the visible spectrum, while the Lyman series is entirely in the UV, and the Paschen series and others are in the IR. Values of nfnf  and  nini are shown for some of the lines. Example 30.1 What is the distance between the slits of a grating that produces a first-order maximum for the second Balmer line at an angle of 15º15º? 15º15º For an Integrated Concept problem, we must first identify the physical principles involved.

Page 356,"Bohr was able to derive the formula for the hydrogen spectrum using basic physics, the planetary model of the atom, and some very important new proposals. His first proposal is that only certain orbits are allowed: we say that the orbits of electrons in atoms are quantized. Each orbit has a different energy, and electrons can move to a higher orbit by absorbing energy and drop to a lower orbit by emitting energy. If the orbits are quantized, the amount of energy absorbed or emitted is also quantized, producing discrete spectra. Photon absorption and emission are among the primary methods of transferring energy into and out of atoms. The energies of the photons are quantized, and their energy is explained as being equal to the change in energy of the electron when it moves from one orbit to another. In equation form, this is 30.19 Here, ΔEΔE is the change in energy between the initial and final orbits, and hfhf is the energy of the absorbed or emitted photon. It is quite logical (that is, expected from our everyday experience) that energy is involved in changing orbits. A blast of energy is required for the space shuttle, for example, to climb to a higher orbit. What is not expected is that atomic orbits should be quantized. This is not observed for satellites or planets, which can have any orbit given the proper energy. (See Figure 30.16.) ΔEΔE hfhf Figure 30.16 The planetary model of the atom, as modified by Bohr, has the orbits of the electrons quantized. Only certain orbits are allowed, explaining why atomic spectra are discrete (quantized). The energy carried away from an atom by a photon comes from the electron dropping from one allowed orbit to another and is thus quantized. This is likewise true for atomic absorption of photons. Figure 30.17 shows an energy-level diagram, a convenient way to display energy states. In the present discussion, we take these to be the allowed energy levels of the electron. Energy is plotted vertically with the lowest or ground state at the bottom and with excited states above. Given the energies of the lines in an atomic spectrum, it is possible (although sometimes very difficult) to determine the energy levels of an atom. Energy-level diagrams are used for many systems, including molecules and nuclei. A theory of the atom or any other system must predict its energies based on the physics of the system. energy-level diagram Figure 30.17 An energy-level diagram plots energy vertically and is useful in visualizing the energy states of a system and the transitions between them. This diagram is for the hydrogen-atom electrons, showing a transition between two orbits having energies E4E4 and E2E2. Bohr was clever enough to find a way to calculate the electron orbital energies in hydrogen. This was an important first step that has been improved upon, but it is well worth repeating here, because it does correctly describe many characteristics of hydrogen. Assuming circular orbits, Bohr proposed that the angular momentum LL of an electron in its orbit is quantized, that is, it has only specific, discrete values. The value for LL is given by the formula LL LL 30.20 where LL  is the angular momentum, meme is the electron’s mass, rnrn is the radius of the nn th orbit, and hh is Planck’s constant. Note that angular momentum is L=IωL=Iω. For a small object at a radius r, I=mr2r, I=mr2 and ω=v/rω=v/r, so that L=mr2v/r=mvrL=mr2v/r=mvr. Quantization says that this value of mvrmvr can only be equal to h/2,2h/2,3h/2h/2,2h/2,3h/2, etc. At the time, Bohr himself did not know why angular momentum should be quantized, but using this assumption he was able to calculate the energies in the hydrogen spectrum, something no one else had done at the time. LL meme rnrn nn hh L=IωL=Iω r, I=mr2r, I=mr2 ω=v/rω=v/r L=mr2v/r=mvrL=mr2v/r=mvr mvrmvr h/2,2h/2,3h/2h/2,2h/2,3h/2 From Bohr’s assumptions, we will now derive a number of important properties of the hydrogen atom from the classical physics we have covered in the text. We start by noting the centripetal force causing the electron to follow a circular path is supplied by the Coulomb force. To be more general, we note that this analysis is valid for any single-electron atom. So, if a nucleus has ZZ protons (Z=1Z=1 for hydrogen, 2 for helium, etc.) and only one electron, that atom is called a hydrogen-like atom. The spectra of hydrogen-like ions are similar to hydrogen, but shifted to higher energy by the greater attractive force between the electron and nucleus. The magnitude of the centripetal force is mev2/rnmev2/rn, while the Coulomb force is kZqeqe/rn2kZqeqe/rn2. The tacit assumption here is that the nucleus is more massive than the stationary electron, and the electron orbits about it. This is consistent with the planetary model of the atom. Equating these, ZZ Z=1Z=1 hydrogen-like atom mev2/rnmev2/rn kZqeqe/rn2kZqeqe/rn2 30.21 Angular momentum quantization is stated in an earlier equation. We solve that equation for vv, substitute it into the above, and rearrange the expression to obtain the radius of the orbit. This yields: vv 30.22 where aBaB is defined to be the Bohr radius, since for the lowest orbit n=1n=1 and for hydrogen Z=1Z=1, r1=aBr1=aB. It is left for this chapter’s Problems and Exercises to show that the Bohr radius is aBaB Bohr radius n=1n=1 Z=1Z=1 r1=aBr1=aB 30.23 These last two equations can be used to calculate the radii of the allowed (quantized) electron orbits in any hydrogen-like atom. It is impressive that the formula gives the correct size of hydrogen, which is measured experimentally to be very close to the Bohr radius. The earlier equation also tells us that the orbital radius is proportional to n2n2, as illustrated in Figure 30.18. n2n2 Figure 30.18 The allowed electron orbits in hydrogen have the radii shown. These radii were first calculated by Bohr and are given by the equation rn=n2ZaBrn=n2ZaB. The lowest orbit has the experimentally verified diameter of a hydrogen atom. To get the electron orbital energies, we start by noting that the electron energy is the sum of its kinetic and potential energy: 30.24 Kinetic energy is the familiar KE=1/2mev2KE=1/2mev2, assuming the electron is not moving at relativistic speeds. Potential energy for the electron is electrical, or PE=qeVPE=qeV, where VV is the potential due to the nucleus, which looks like a point charge. The nucleus has a positive charge ZqeZqe ; thus,

, recalling an earlier equation for the potential due to a point charge. Since the electron’s charge is negative, we see that PE=−kZqe/rnPE=−kZqe/rn. Entering the expressions for KEKE and PEPE, we find KE=1/2mev2KE=1/2mev2 PE=qeVPE=qeV VV ZqeZqe V

Algebraic manipulation yields rnrn vv 30.26 for the orbital energies of hydrogen-like atoms. Here, E0E0 is the ground-state energy n=1n=1 for hydrogen Z=1Z=1 and is given by energies of hydrogen-like atoms E0E0 n=1n=1 Z=1Z=1 30.27 Thus, for hydrogen, 30.28 Figure 30.19 shows an energy-level diagram for hydrogen that also illustrates how the various spectral series for hydrogen are related to transitions between energy levels. Figure 30.19 Energy-level diagram for hydrogen showing the Lyman, Balmer, and Paschen series of transitions. The orbital energies are calculated using the above equation, first derived by Bohr. Electron total energies are negative, since the electron is bound to the nucleus, analogous to being in a hole without enough kinetic energy to escape. As nn approaches infinity, the total energy becomes zero. This corresponds to a free electron with no kinetic energy, since rnrn gets very large for large nn, and the electric potential energy thus becomes zero. Thus, 13.6 eV is needed to ionize hydrogen (to go from –13.6 eV to 0, or unbound), an experimentally verified number. Given more energy, the electron becomes unbound with some kinetic energy. For example, giving 15.0 eV to an electron in the ground state of hydrogen strips it from the atom and leaves it with 1.4 eV of kinetic energy. nn rnrn nn Finally, let us consider the energy of a photon emitted in a downward transition, given by the equation to be 30.29 Substituting En=(–13.6 eV/n2)En=(–13.6 eV/n2), we see that En=(–13.6 eV/n2)En=(–13.6 eV/n2) 30.30 Dividing both sides of this equation by hchc gives an expression for 1/λ1/λ: hchc 1/λ1/λ 30.31 It can be shown that 30.32 is the Rydberg constant. Thus, we have used Bohr’s assumptions to derive the formula first proposed by Balmer years earlier as a recipe to fit experimental data. Rydberg constant 30.33 We see that Bohr’s theory of the hydrogen atom answers the question as to why this previously known formula describes the hydrogen spectrum. It is because the energy levels are proportional to 1/n21/n2, where nn is a non-negative integer. A downward transition releases energy, and so nini must be greater than nfnf. The various series are those where the transitions end on a certain level. For the Lyman series, nf=1nf=1 — that is, all the transitions end in the ground state (see also Figure 30.19). For the Balmer series, nf=2nf=2, or all the transitions end in the first excited state; and so on. What was once a recipe is now based in physics, and something new is emerging—angular momentum is quantized. 1/n21/n2 nn nini nfnf nf=1nf=1 nf=2nf=2"
Page 356,"Bohr did what no one had been able to do before. Not only did he explain the spectrum of hydrogen, he correctly calculated the size of the atom from basic physics. Some of his ideas are broadly applicable. Electron orbital energies are quantized in all atoms and molecules. Angular momentum is quantized. The electrons do not spiral into the nucleus, as expected classically (accelerated charges radiate, so that the electron orbits classically would decay quickly, and the electrons would sit on the nucleus—matter would collapse). These are major triumphs. But there are limits to Bohr’s theory. It cannot be applied to multielectron atoms, even one as simple as a two-electron helium atom. Bohr’s model is what we call semiclassical. The orbits are quantized (nonclassical) but are assumed to be simple circular paths (classical). As quantum mechanics was developed, it became clear that there are no well-defined orbits; rather, there are clouds of probability. Bohr’s theory also did not explain that some spectral lines are doublets (split into two) when examined closely. We shall examine many of these aspects of quantum mechanics in more detail, but it should be kept in mind that Bohr did not fail. Rather, he made very important steps along the path to greater knowledge and laid the foundation for all of atomic physics that has since evolved."

Page 357,"Calculate the approximate energy of a KαKα x ray from a tungsten anode in an x-ray tube. KαKα How do we calculate energies in a multiple-electron atom? In the case of characteristic x rays, the following approximate calculation is reasonable. Characteristic x rays are produced when an inner-shell vacancy is filled. Inner-shell electrons are nearer the nucleus than others in an atom and thus feel little net effect from the others. This is similar to what happens inside a charged conductor, where its excess charge is distributed over the surface so that it produces no electric field inside. It is reasonable to assume the inner-shell electrons have hydrogen-like energies, as given by En=−Z2n2E0En=−Z2n2E0n=1, 2, 3, ...n=1, 2, 3, .... As noted, a KαKα x ray is produced by an n=2n=2 to n=1n=1 transition. Since there are two electrons in a filled KK shell, a vacancy would leave one electron, so that the effective charge would be Z−1Z−1 rather than ZZ. For tungsten, Z=74Z=74, so that the effective charge is 73. En=−Z2n2E0En=−Z2n2E0 n=1, 2, 3, ...n=1, 2, 3, ...

It is large compared with other atomic emissions because it is produced when an inner-shell vacancy is filled, and inner-shell electrons are tightly bound. Characteristic x ray energies become progressively larger for heavier elements because their energy increases approximately as Z2Z2. Significant accelerating voltage is needed to create these inner-shell vacancies. In the case of tungsten, at least 72.5 kV is needed, because other shells are filled and you cannot simply bump one electron to a higher filled shell. Tungsten is a common anode material in x-ray tubes; so much of the energy of the impinging electrons is absorbed, raising its temperature, that a high-melting-point material like tungsten is required.

Page 357,"All of us can identify diagnostic uses of x-ray photons. Among these are the universal dental and medical x rays that have become an essential part of medical diagnostics. (See Figure 30.23 and Figure 30.24.) X rays are also used to inspect our luggage at airports, as shown in Figure 30.22, and for early detection of cracks in crucial aircraft components. An x ray is not only a noun meaning high-energy photon, it also is an image produced by x rays, and it has been made into a familiar verb—to be x-rayed. Figure 30.22 An x-ray image reveals fillings in a person’s teeth. (credit: Dmitry G, Wikimedia Commons) Figure 30.23 This x-ray image of a person’s chest shows many details, including an artificial pacemaker. (credit: Sunzi99, Wikimedia Commons) Figure 30.24 This x-ray image shows the contents of a piece of luggage. The denser the material, the darker the shadow. (credit: IDuke, Wikimedia Commons) The most common x-ray images are simple shadows. Since x-ray photons have high energies, they penetrate materials that are opaque to visible light. The more energy an x-ray photon has, the more material it will penetrate. So an x-ray tube may be operated at 50.0 kV for a chest x ray, whereas it may need to be operated at 100 kV to examine a broken leg in a cast. The depth of penetration is related to the density of the material as well as to the energy of the photon. The denser the material, the fewer x-ray photons get through and the darker the shadow. Thus x rays excel at detecting breaks in bones and in imaging other physiological structures, such as some tumors, that differ in density from surrounding material. Because of their high photon energy, x rays produce significant ionization in materials and damage cells in biological organisms. Modern uses minimize exposure to the patient and eliminate exposure to others. Biological effects of x rays will be explored in the next chapter along with other types of ionizing radiation such as those produced by nuclei. As the x-ray energy increases, the Compton effect (see Photon Momentum) becomes more important in the attenuation of the x rays. Here, the x ray scatters from an outer electron shell of the atom, giving the ejected electron some kinetic energy while losing energy itself. The probability for attenuation of the x rays depends upon the number of electrons present (the material’s density) as well as the thickness of the material. Chemical composition of the medium, as characterized by its atomic number ZZ, is not important here. Low-energy x rays provide better contrast (sharper images). However, due to greater attenuation and less scattering, they are more absorbed by thicker materials. Greater contrast can be achieved by injecting a substance with a large atomic number, such as barium or iodine. The structure of the part of the body that contains the substance (e.g., the gastro-intestinal tract or the abdomen) can easily be seen this way. ZZ Breast cancer is the second-leading cause of death among women worldwide. Early detection can be very effective, hence the importance of x-ray diagnostics. A mammogram cannot diagnose a malignant tumor, only give evidence of a lump or region of increased density within the breast. X-ray absorption by different types of soft tissue is very similar, so contrast is difficult; this is especially true for younger women, who typically have denser breasts. For older women who are at greater risk of developing breast cancer, the presence of more fat in the breast gives the lump or tumor more contrast. MRI (Magnetic resonance imaging) has recently been used as a supplement to conventional x rays to improve detection and eliminate false positives. The subject’s radiation dose from x rays will be treated in a later chapter. A standard x ray gives only a two-dimensional view of the object. Dense bones might hide images of soft tissue or organs. If you took another x ray from the side of the person (the first one being from the front), you would gain additional information. While shadow images are sufficient in many applications, far more sophisticated images can be produced with modern technology. Figure 30.25 shows the use of a computed tomography (CT) scanner, also called computed axial tomography (CAT) scanner. X rays are passed through a narrow section (called a slice) of the patient’s body (or body part) over a range of directions. An array of many detectors on the other side of the patient registers the x rays. The system is then rotated around the patient and another image is taken, and so on. The x-ray tube and detector array are mechanically attached and so rotate together. Complex computer image processing of the relative absorption of the x rays along different directions produces a highly-detailed image. Different slices are taken as the patient moves through the scanner on a table. Multiple images of different slices can also be computer analyzed to produce three-dimensional information, sometimes enhancing specific types of tissue, as shown in Figure 30.26. G. Hounsfield (UK) and A. Cormack (US) won the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1979 for their development of computed tomography.

Page 357,"Since x-ray photons are very energetic, they have relatively short wavelengths. For example, the 54.4-keV KαKα x ray of Example 30.2 has a wavelength λ=hc/E=0.0228 nmλ=hc/E=0.0228 nm. Thus, typical x-ray photons act like rays when they encounter macroscopic objects, like teeth, and produce sharp shadows; however, since atoms are on the order of 0.1 nm in size, x rays can be used to detect the location, shape, and size of atoms and molecules. The process is called x-ray diffraction, because it involves the diffraction and interference of x rays to produce patterns that can be analyzed for information about the structures that scattered the x rays. Perhaps the most famous example of x-ray diffraction is the discovery of the double-helix structure of DNA in 1953 by an international team of scientists working at the Cavendish Laboratory—American James Watson, Englishman Francis Crick, and New Zealand–born Maurice Wilkins. Using x-ray diffraction data produced by Rosalind Franklin, they were the first to discern the structure of DNA that is so crucial to life. For this, Watson, Crick, and Wilkins were awarded the 1962 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. There is much debate and controversy over the issue that Rosalind Franklin was not included in the prize. KαKα λ=hc/E=0.0228 nmλ=hc/E=0.0228 nm x-ray diffraction Figure 30.27 shows a diffraction pattern produced by the scattering of x rays from a crystal. This process is known as x-ray crystallography because of the information it can yield about crystal structure, and it was the type of data Rosalind Franklin supplied to Watson and Crick for DNA. Not only do x rays confirm the size and shape of atoms, they give information on the atomic arrangements in materials. For example, current research in high-temperature superconductors involves complex materials whose lattice arrangements are crucial to obtaining a superconducting material. These can be studied using x-ray crystallography. Figure 30.27 X-ray diffraction from the crystal of a protein, hen egg lysozyme, produced this interference pattern. Analysis of the pattern yields information about the structure of the protein. (credit: Del45, Wikimedia Commons) Historically, the scattering of x rays from crystals was used to prove that x rays are energetic EM waves. This was suspected from the time of the discovery of x rays in 1895, but it was not until 1912 that the German Max von Laue (1879–1960) convinced two of his colleagues to scatter x rays from crystals. If a diffraction pattern is obtained, he reasoned, then the x rays must be waves, and their wavelength could be determined. (The spacing of atoms in various crystals was reasonably well known at the time, based on good values for Avogadro’s number.) The experiments were convincing, and the 1914 Nobel Prize in Physics was given to von Laue for his suggestion leading to the proof that x rays are EM waves. In 1915, the unique father-and-son team of Sir William Henry Bragg and his son Sir William Lawrence Bragg were awarded a joint Nobel Prize for inventing the x-ray spectrometer and the then-new science of x-ray analysis. The elder Bragg had migrated to Australia from England just after graduating in mathematics. He learned physics and chemistry during his career at the University of Adelaide. The younger Bragg was born in Adelaide but went back to the Cavendish Laboratories in England to a career in x-ray and neutron crystallography; he provided support for Watson, Crick, and Wilkins for their work on unraveling the mysteries of DNA and to Max Perutz for his 1962 Nobel Prize-winning work on the structure of hemoglobin. Here again, we witness the enabling nature of physics—establishing instruments and designing experiments as well as solving mysteries in the biomedical sciences. Certain other uses for x rays will be studied in later chapters. X rays are useful in the treatment of cancer because of the inhibiting effect they have on cell reproduction. X rays observed coming from outer space are useful in determining the nature of their sources, such as neutron stars and possibly black holes. Created in nuclear bomb explosions, x rays can also be used to detect clandestine atmospheric tests of these weapons. X rays can cause excitations of atoms, which then fluoresce (emitting characteristic EM radiation), making x-ray-induced fluorescence a valuable analytical tool in a range of fields from art to archaeology."

Page 358,"The ability of a material to emit various wavelengths of light is similarly related to its atomic energy levels. Figure 30.29 shows a scorpion illuminated by a UV lamp, sometimes called a black light. Some rocks also glow in black light, the particular colors being a function of the rock’s mineral composition. Black lights are also used to make certain posters glow. Figure 30.29 Objects glow in the visible spectrum when illuminated by an ultraviolet (black) light. Emissions are characteristic of the mineral involved, since they are related to its energy levels. In the case of scorpions, proteins near the surface of their skin give off the characteristic blue glow. This is a colorful example of fluorescence in which excitation is induced by UV radiation while de-excitation occurs in the form of visible light. (credit: Ken Bosma, Flickr) In the fluorescence process, an atom is excited to a level several steps above its ground state by the absorption of a relatively high-energy UV photon. This is called atomic excitation. Once it is excited, the atom can de-excite in several ways, one of which is to re-emit a photon of the same energy as excited it, a single step back to the ground state. This is called atomic de-excitation. All other paths of de-excitation involve smaller steps, in which lower-energy (longer wavelength) photons are emitted. Some of these may be in the visible range, such as for the scorpion in Figure 30.29. Fluorescence is defined to be any process in which an atom or molecule, excited by a photon of a given energy, and de-excites by emission of a lower-energy photon. atomic excitation atomic de-excitation Fluorescence Fluorescence can be induced by many types of energy input. Fluorescent paint, dyes, and even soap residues in clothes make colors seem brighter in sunlight by converting some UV into visible light. X rays can induce fluorescence, as is done in x-ray fluoroscopy to make brighter visible images. Electric discharges can induce fluorescence, as in so-called neon lights and in gas-discharge tubes that produce atomic and molecular spectra. Common fluorescent lights use an electric discharge in mercury vapor to cause atomic emissions from mercury atoms. The inside of a fluorescent light is coated with a fluorescent material that emits visible light over a broad spectrum of wavelengths. By choosing an appropriate coating, fluorescent lights can be made more like sunlight or like the reddish glow of candlelight, depending on needs. Fluorescent lights are more efficient in converting electrical energy into visible light than incandescent filaments (about four times as efficient), the blackbody radiation of which is primarily in the infrared due to temperature limitations. This atom is excited to one of its higher levels by absorbing a UV photon. It can de-excite in a single step, re-emitting a photon of the same energy, or in several steps. The process is called fluorescence if the atom de-excites in smaller steps, emitting energy different from that which excited it. Fluorescence can be induced by a variety of energy inputs, such as UV, x-rays, and electrical discharge. The spectacular Waitomo caves on North Island in New Zealand provide a natural habitat for glow-worms. The glow-worms hang up to 70 silk threads of about 30 or 40 cm each to trap prey that fly towards them in the dark. The fluorescence process is very efficient, with nearly 100% of the energy input turning into light. (In comparison, fluorescent lights are about 20% efficient.) Fluorescence has many uses in biology and medicine. It is commonly used to label and follow a molecule within a cell. Such tagging allows one to study the structure of DNA and proteins. Fluorescent dyes and antibodies are usually used to tag the molecules, which are then illuminated with UV light and their emission of visible light is observed. Since the fluorescence of each element is characteristic, identification of elements within a sample can be done this way. Figure 30.30 shows a commonly used fluorescent dye called fluorescein. Below that, Figure 30.31 reveals the diffusion of a fluorescent dye in water by observing it under UV light. Figure 30.30 Fluorescein, shown here in powder form, is used to dye laboratory samples. (credit: Benjah-bmm27, Wikimedia Commons) Figure 30.31 Here, fluorescent powder is added to a beaker of water. The mixture gives off a bright glow under ultraviolet light. (credit: Bricksnite, Wikimedia Commons) Nano-Crystals Recently, a new class of fluorescent materials has appeared—“nano-crystals.” These are single-crystal molecules less than 100 nm in size. The smallest of these are called “quantum dots.” These semiconductor indicators are very small (2–6 nm) and provide improved brightness. They also have the advantage that all colors can be excited with the same incident wavelength. They are brighter and more stable than organic dyes and have a longer lifetime than conventional phosphors. They have become an excellent tool for long-term studies of cells, including migration and morphology. (Figure 30.32.) Figure 30.32 Microscopic image of chicken cells using nano-crystals of a fluorescent dye. Cell nuclei exhibit blue fluorescence while neurofilaments exhibit green. (credit: Weerapong Prasongchean, Wikimedia Commons) Once excited, an atom or molecule will usually spontaneously de-excite quickly. (The electrons raised to higher levels are attracted to lower ones by the positive charge of the nucleus.) Spontaneous de-excitation has a very short mean lifetime of typically about 10−8 s10−8 s. However, some levels have significantly longer lifetimes, ranging up to milliseconds to minutes or even hours. These energy levels are inhibited and are slow in de-exciting because their quantum numbers differ greatly from those of available lower levels. Although these level lifetimes are short in human terms, they are many orders of magnitude longer than is typical and, thus, are said to be metastable, meaning relatively stable. Phosphorescence is the de-excitation of a metastable state. Glow-in-the-dark materials, such as luminous dials on some watches and clocks and on children’s toys and pajamas, are made of phosphorescent substances. Visible light excites the atoms or molecules to metastable states that decay slowly, releasing the stored excitation energy partially as visible light. In some ceramics, atomic excitation energy can be frozen in after the ceramic has cooled from its firing. It is very slowly released, but the ceramic can be induced to phosphoresce by heating—a process called “thermoluminescence.” Since the release is slow, thermoluminescence can be used to date antiquities. The less light emitted, the older the ceramic. (See Figure 30.33.) 10−8 s10−8 s metastable Phosphorescence Figure 30.33 Atoms frozen in an excited state when this Chinese ceramic figure was fired can be stimulated to de-excite and emit EM radiation by heating a sample of the ceramic—a process called thermoluminescence. Since the states slowly de-excite over centuries, the amount of thermoluminescence decreases with age, making it possible to use this effect to date and authenticate antiquities. This figure dates from the 11th century. (credit: Vassil, Wikimedia Commons)"

Page 358,"Lasers today are commonplace. Lasers are used to read bar codes at stores and in libraries, laser shows are staged for entertainment, laser printers produce high-quality images at relatively low cost, and lasers send prodigious numbers of telephone messages through optical fibers. Among other things, lasers are also employed in surveying, weapons guidance, tumor eradication, retinal welding, and for reading DVDs, Blu-rays, and computer or game console CD-ROMs. Why do lasers have so many varied applications? The answer is that lasers produce single-wavelength EM radiation that is also very coherent—that is, the emitted photons are in phase. Laser output can, thus, be more precisely manipulated than incoherent mixed-wavelength EM radiation from other sources. The reason laser output is so pure and coherent is based on how it is produced, which in turn depends on a metastable state in the lasing material. Suppose a material had the energy levels shown in Figure 30.34. When energy is put into a large collection of these atoms, electrons are raised to all possible levels. Most return to the ground state in less than about 10−8 s10−8 s, but those in the metastable state linger. This includes those electrons originally excited to the metastable state and those that fell into it from above. It is possible to get a majority of the atoms into the metastable state, a condition called a population inversion. 10−8 s10−8 s population inversion Figure 30.34 (a) Energy-level diagram for an atom showing the first few states, one of which is metastable. (b) Massive energy input excites atoms to a variety of states. (c) Most states decay quickly, leaving electrons only in the metastable and ground state. If a majority of electrons are in the metastable state, a population inversion has been achieved. Once a population inversion is achieved, a very interesting thing can happen, as shown in Figure 30.35. An electron spontaneously falls from the metastable state, emitting a photon. This photon finds another atom in the metastable state and stimulates it to decay, emitting a second photon of the same wavelength and in phase with the first, and so on. Stimulated emission is the emission of electromagnetic radiation in the form of photons of a given frequency, triggered by photons of the same frequency. For example, an excited atom, with an electron in an energy orbit higher than normal, releases a photon of a specific frequency when the electron drops back to a lower energy orbit. If this photon then strikes another electron in the same high-energy orbit in another atom, another photon of the same frequency is released. The emitted photons and the triggering photons are always in phase, have the same polarization, and travel in the same direction. The probability of absorption of a photon is the same as the probability of stimulated emission, and so a majority of atoms must be in the metastable state to produce energy. Einstein (again Einstein, and back in 1917!) was one of the important contributors to the understanding of stimulated emission of radiation. Decades before the technology was invented to even experiment with laser generation, Einstein was the first to realize that stimulated emission and absorption are equally probable. The laser acts as a temporary energy storage device that subsequently produces a massive energy output of single-wavelength, in-phase photons. Stimulated emission Figure 30.35 One atom in the metastable state spontaneously decays to a lower level, producing a photon that goes on to stimulate another atom to de-excite. The second photon has exactly the same energy and wavelength as the first and is in phase with it. Both go on to stimulate the emission of other photons. A population inversion is necessary for there to be a net production rather than a net absorption of the photons. The name laser is an acronym for light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation, the process just described. The process was proposed and developed following the advances in quantum physics. A joint Nobel Prize was awarded in 1964 to American Charles Townes (1915–), and Nikolay Basov (1922–2001) and Aleksandr Prokhorov (1916–2002), from the Soviet Union, for the development of lasers. The Nobel Prize in 1981 went to Arthur Schawlow (1921-1999) for pioneering laser applications. The original devices were called masers, because they produced microwaves. The first working laser was created in 1960 at Hughes Research labs (CA) by T. Maiman. It used a pulsed high-powered flash lamp and a ruby rod to produce red light. Today the name laser is used for all such devices developed to produce a variety of wavelengths, including microwave, infrared, visible, and ultraviolet radiation. Figure 30.36 shows how a laser can be constructed to enhance the stimulated emission of radiation. Energy input can be from a flash tube, electrical discharge, or other sources, in a process sometimes called optical pumping. A large percentage of the original pumping energy is dissipated in other forms, but a population inversion must be achieved. Mirrors can be used to enhance stimulated emission by multiple passes of the radiation back and forth through the lasing material. One of the mirrors is semitransparent to allow some of the light to pass through. The laser output from a laser is a mere 1% of the light passing back and forth in a laser. laser As described earlier in the section on laser vision correction, Donna Strickland and Gérard Mourou, working at University of Rochester, developed a method to greatly increase the power of lasers, while also enabling them to be miniaturized. By passing the light over a specific type of grating, their method segments (or chirps) the delivery of the beam components in a matter that generates little heat at the source. Chirped pulse amplification is now used in some of the world’s most powerful lasers as well as those commonly used to make precise microcuts or burns in medical applications. Strickland and Mourou were awarded the Nobel Prize in 1918. Figure 30.36 Typical laser construction has a method of pumping energy into the lasing material to produce a population inversion. (a) Spontaneous emission begins with some photons escaping and others stimulating further emissions. (b) and (c) Mirrors are used to enhance the probability of stimulated emission by passing photons through the material several times. Lasers are constructed from many types of lasing materials, including gases, liquids, solids, and semiconductors. But all lasers are based on the existence of a metastable state or a phosphorescent material. Some lasers produce continuous output; others are pulsed in bursts as brief as 10−14 s10−14 s. Some laser outputs are fantastically powerful—some greater than 1012 W1012 W —but the more common, everyday lasers produce something on the order of 10−3 W10−3 W. The helium-neon laser that produces a familiar red light is very common. Figure 30.37 shows the energy levels of helium and neon, a pair of noble gases that work well together. An electrical discharge is passed through a helium-neon gas mixture in which the number of atoms of helium is ten times that of neon. The first excited state of helium is metastable and, thus, stores energy. This energy is easily transferred by collision to neon atoms, because they have an excited state at nearly the same energy as that in helium. That state in neon is also metastable, and this is the one that produces the laser output. (The most likely transition is to the nearby state, producing 1.96 eV photons, which have a wavelength of 633 nm and appear red.) A population inversion can be produced in neon, because there are so many more helium atoms and these put energy into the neon. Helium-neon lasers often have continuous output, because the population inversion can be maintained even while lasing occurs. Probably the most common lasers in use today, including the common laser pointer, are semiconductor or diode lasers, made of silicon. Here, energy is pumped into the material by passing a current in the device to excite the electrons. Special coatings on the ends and fine cleavings of the semiconductor material allow light to bounce back and forth and a tiny fraction to emerge as laser light. Diode lasers can usually run continually and produce outputs in the milliwatt range. 10−14 s10−14 s 1012 W1012 W 10−3 W10−3 W Figure 30.37 Energy levels in helium and neon. In the common helium-neon laser, an electrical discharge pumps energy into the metastable states of both atoms. The gas mixture has about ten times more helium atoms than neon atoms. Excited helium atoms easily de-excite by transferring energy to neon in a collision. A population inversion in neon is achieved, allowing lasing by the neon to occur. There are many medical applications of lasers. Lasers have the advantage that they can be focused to a small spot. They also have a well-defined wavelength. Many types of lasers are available today that provide wavelengths from the ultraviolet to the infrared. This is important, as one needs to be able to select a wavelength that will be preferentially absorbed by the material of interest. Objects appear a certain color because they absorb all other visible colors incident upon them. What wavelengths are absorbed depends upon the energy spacing between electron orbitals in that molecule. Unlike the hydrogen atom, biological molecules are complex and have a variety of absorption wavelengths or lines. But these can be determined and used in the selection of a laser with the appropriate wavelength. Water is transparent to the visible spectrum but will absorb light in the UV and IR regions. Blood (hemoglobin) strongly reflects red but absorbs most strongly in the UV. Laser surgery uses a wavelength that is strongly absorbed by the tissue it is focused upon. One example of a medical application of lasers is shown in Figure 30.38. A detached retina can result in total loss of vision. Burns made by a laser focused to a small spot on the retina form scar tissue that can hold the retina in place, salvaging the patient’s vision. Other light sources cannot be focused as precisely as a laser due to refractive dispersion of different wavelengths. Similarly, laser surgery in the form of cutting or burning away tissue is made more accurate because laser output can be very precisely focused and is preferentially absorbed because of its single wavelength. Depending upon what part or layer of the retina needs repairing, the appropriate type of laser can be selected. For the repair of tears in the retina, a green argon laser is generally used. This light is absorbed well by tissues containing blood, so coagulation or “welding” of the tear can be done. Figure 30.38 A detached retina is burned by a laser designed to focus on a small spot on the retina, the resulting scar tissue holding it in place. The lens of the eye is used to focus the light, as is the device bringing the laser output to the eye. In dentistry, the use of lasers is rising. Lasers are most commonly used for surgery on the soft tissue of the mouth. They can be used to remove ulcers, stop bleeding, and reshape gum tissue. Their use in cutting into bones and teeth is not quite so common; here the erbium YAG (yttrium aluminum garnet) laser is used. The massive combination of lasers shown in Figure 30.39 can be used to induce nuclear fusion, the energy source of the sun and hydrogen bombs. Since lasers can produce very high power in very brief pulses, they can be used to focus an enormous amount of energy on a small glass sphere containing fusion fuel. Not only does the incident energy increase the fuel temperature significantly so that fusion can occur, it also compresses the fuel to great density, enhancing the probability of fusion. The compression or implosion is caused by the momentum of the impinging laser photons. Figure 30.39 This system of lasers at Lawrence Livermore Laboratory is used to ignite nuclear fusion. A tremendous burst of energy is focused on a small fuel pellet, which is imploded to the high density and temperature needed to make the fusion reaction proceed.

They store information digitally and have a much larger information-storage capacity than their predecessors, audio and video cassette tapes. An entire encyclopedia can be stored on a single CD. Figure 30.40 illustrates how the information is stored and read from the CD. Pits made in the CD by a laser can be tiny and very accurately spaced to record digital information. These are read by having an inexpensive solid-state infrared laser beam scatter from pits as the CD spins, revealing their digital pattern and the information encoded upon them. Figure 30.40 A CD has digital information stored in the form of laser-created pits on its surface. These in turn can be read by detecting the laser light scattered from the pit. Large information capacity is possible because of the precision of the laser. Shorter-wavelength lasers enable greater storage capacity. Holograms, such as those in Figure 30.41, are true three-dimensional images recorded on film by lasers. Holograms are used for amusement, decoration on novelty items and magazine covers, security on credit cards and driver’s licenses (a laser and other equipment is needed to reproduce them), and for serious three-dimensional information storage. You can see that a hologram is a true three-dimensional image, because objects change relative position in the image when viewed from different angles. Figure 30.41 Credit cards commonly have holograms for logos, making them difficult to reproduce (credit: Dominic Alves, Flickr) The name hologram means “entire picture” (from the Greek holo, as in holistic), because the image is three-dimensional. Holography is the process of producing holograms and, although they are recorded on photographic film, the process is quite different from normal photography. Holography uses light interference or wave optics, whereas normal photography uses geometric optics. Figure 30.42 shows one method of producing a hologram. Coherent light from a laser is split by a mirror, with part of the light illuminating the object. The remainder, called the reference beam, shines directly on a piece of film. Light scattered from the object interferes with the reference beam, producing constructive and destructive interference. As a result, the exposed film looks foggy, but close examination reveals a complicated interference pattern stored on it. Where the interference was constructive, the film (a negative actually) is darkened. Holography is sometimes called lensless photography, because it uses the wave characteristics of light as contrasted to normal photography, which uses geometric optics and so requires lenses. hologram Holography Figure 30.42 Production of a hologram. Single-wavelength coherent light from a laser produces a well-defined interference pattern on a piece of film. The laser beam is split by a partially silvered mirror, with part of the light illuminating the object and the remainder shining directly on the film. Light falling on a hologram can form a three-dimensional image. The process is complicated in detail, but the basics can be understood as shown in Figure 30.43, in which a laser of the same type that exposed the film is now used to illuminate it. The myriad tiny exposed regions of the film are dark and block the light, while less exposed regions allow light to pass. The film thus acts much like a collection of diffraction gratings with various spacings. Light passing through the hologram is diffracted in various directions, producing both real and virtual images of the object used to expose the film. The interference pattern is the same as that produced by the object. Moving your eye to various places in the interference pattern gives you different perspectives, just as looking directly at the object would. The image thus looks like the object and is three-dimensional like the object. Figure 30.43 A transmission hologram is one that produces real and virtual images when a laser of the same type as that which exposed the hologram is passed through it. Diffraction from various parts of the film produces the same interference pattern as the object that was used to expose it. The hologram illustrated in Figure 30.43 is a transmission hologram. Holograms that are viewed with reflected light, such as the white light holograms on credit cards, are reflection holograms and are more common. White light holograms often appear a little blurry with rainbow edges, because the diffraction patterns of various colors of light are at slightly different locations due to their different wavelengths. Further uses of holography include all types of 3-D information storage, such as of statues in museums and engineering studies of structures and 3-D images of human organs. Invented in the late 1940s by Dennis Gabor (1900–1979), who won the 1971 Nobel Prize in Physics for his work, holography became far more practical with the development of the laser. Since lasers produce coherent single-wavelength light, their interference patterns are more pronounced. The precision is so great that it is even possible to record numerous holograms on a single piece of film by just changing the angle of the film for each successive image. This is how the holograms that move as you walk by them are produced—a kind of lensless movie. In a similar way, in the medical field, holograms have allowed complete 3-D holographic displays of objects from a stack of images. Storing these images for future use is relatively easy. With the use of an endoscope, high-resolution 3-D holographic images of internal organs and tissues can be made."

Only those states where matter interferes constructively exist, or are “allowed.” Since there is a lowest orbit where this is possible in an atom, the electron cannot spiral into the nucleus. It cannot exist closer to or inside the nucleus. The wave nature of matter is what prevents matter from collapsing and gives atoms their sizes."

Page 361,"There are two more quantum numbers of immediate concern. Both were first discovered for electrons in conjunction with fine structure in atomic spectra. It is now well established that electrons and other fundamental particles have intrinsic spin, roughly analogous to a planet spinning on its axis. This spin is a fundamental characteristic of particles, and only one magnitude of intrinsic spin is allowed for a given type of particle. Intrinsic angular momentum is quantized independently of orbital angular momentum. Additionally, the direction of the spin is also quantized. It has been found that the magnitude of the intrinsic (internal) spin angular momentum, ss, of an electron is given by magnitude of the intrinsic (internal) spin angular momentum ss 30.53 where ss is defined to be the spin quantum number. This is very similar to the quantization of LL given in L=ll+1h2πL=ll+1h2π, except that the only value allowed for ss for electrons is 1/2. ss spin quantum number LL L=ll+1h2πL=ll+1h2π ss The direction of intrinsic spin is quantized, just as is the direction of orbital angular momentum. The direction of spin angular momentum along one direction in space, again called the zz-axis, can have only the values zz 30.54 for electrons. SzSz is the zz-component of spin angular momentum and msms is the spin projection quantum number. For electrons, ss can only be 1/2, and msms can be either +1/2 or –1/2. Spin projection ms=+1/2ms=+1/2 is referred to as spin up, whereas ms=−1/2ms=−1/2 is called spin down. These are illustrated in Figure 30.51. SzSz zz-component of spin angular momentum zz msms spin projection quantum number ss msms ms=+1/2ms=+1/2 ms=−1/2ms=−1/2 Intrinsic Spin In later chapters, we will see that intrinsic spin is a characteristic of all subatomic particles. For some particles ss is half-integral, whereas for others ss is integral—there are crucial differences between half-integral spin particles and integral spin particles. Protons and neutrons, like electrons, have s=1/2s=1/2, whereas photons have s=1s=1, and other particles called pions have s=0s=0, and so on. ss ss s=1/2s=1/2 s=1s=1 s=0s=0 To summarize, the state of a system, such as the precise nature of an electron in an atom, is determined by its particular quantum numbers. These are expressed in the form n, l,ml,msn, l,ml,ms —see Table 30.1 For electrons in atoms, the principal quantum number can have the values n=1, 2, 3, ...n=1, 2, 3, .... Once nn is known, the values of the angular momentum quantum number are limited to l=1, 2, 3, ...,n−1l=1, 2, 3, ...,n−1. For a given value of ll, the angular momentum projection quantum number can have only the values ml=−l,−l+1, ...,−1, 0, 1, ...,l−1,lml=−l,−l+1, ...,−1, 0, 1, ...,l−1,l. Electron spin is independent of n, l,n, l, and mlml, always having s=1/2s=1/2. The spin projection quantum number can have two values, ms=1/2 or −1/2ms=1/2 or −1/2. n, l,ml,msn, l,ml,ms n=1, 2, 3, ...n=1, 2, 3, ... nn l=1, 2, 3, ...,n−1l=1, 2, 3, ...,n−1 ll ml=−l,−l+1, ...,−1, 0, 1, ...,l−1,lml=−l,−l+1, ...,−1, 0, 1, ...,l−1,l n, l,n, l, mlml s=1/2s=1/2 ms=1/2 or −1/2ms=1/2 or −1/2 Table 30.1 Atomic Quantum Numbers Figure 30.53 shows several hydrogen states corresponding to different sets of quantum numbers. Note that these clouds of probability are the locations of electrons as determined by making repeated measurements—each measurement finds the electron in a definite location, with a greater chance of finding the electron in some places rather than others. With repeated measurements, the pattern of probability shown in the figure emerges. The clouds of probability do not look like nor do they correspond to classical orbits. The uncertainty principle actually prevents us and nature from knowing how the electron gets from one place to another, and so an orbit really does not exist as such. Nature on a small scale is again much different from that on the large scale. Figure 30.53 Probability clouds for the electron in the ground state and several excited states of hydrogen. The nature of these states is determined by their sets of quantum numbers, here given as n,l,mln,l,ml. The ground state is (0, 0, 0); one of the possibilities for the second excited state is (3, 2, 1). The probability of finding the electron is indicated by the shade of color; the darker the coloring the greater the chance of finding the electron. We will see that the quantum numbers discussed in this section are valid for a broad range of particles and other systems, such as nuclei. Some quantum numbers, such as intrinsic spin, are related to fundamental classifications of subatomic particles, and they obey laws that will give us further insight into the substructure of matter and its interactions."

Page 362,"All atoms except hydrogen are multiple-electron atoms. The physical and chemical properties of elements are directly related to the number of electrons a neutral atom has. The periodic table of the elements groups elements with similar properties into columns. This systematic organization is related to the number of electrons in a neutral atom, called the atomic number, ZZ. We shall see in this section that the exclusion principle is key to the underlying explanations, and that it applies far beyond the realm of atomic physics. atomic number ZZ In 1925, the Austrian physicist Wolfgang Pauli (see Figure 30.54) proposed the following rule: No two electrons can have the same set of quantum numbers. That is, no two electrons can be in the same state. This statement is known as the Pauli exclusion principle, because it excludes electrons from being in the same state. The Pauli exclusion principle is extremely powerful and very broadly applicable. It applies to any identical particles with half-integral intrinsic spin—that is, having s=1/2, 3/2, ...s=1/2, 3/2, ... Thus no two electrons can have the same set of quantum numbers. Pauli exclusion principle s=1/2, 3/2, ...s=1/2, 3/2, ... Pauli Exclusion Principle No two electrons can have the same set of quantum numbers. That is, no two electrons can be in the same state. Figure 30.54 The Austrian physicist Wolfgang Pauli (1900–1958) played a major role in the development of quantum mechanics. He proposed the exclusion principle; hypothesized the existence of an important particle, called the neutrino, before it was directly observed; made fundamental contributions to several areas of theoretical physics; and influenced many students who went on to do important work of their own. (credit: Nobel Foundation, via Wikimedia Commons) Let us examine how the exclusion principle applies to electrons in atoms. The quantum numbers involved were defined in Quantum Numbers and Rules as n, l,ml, sn, l,ml, s, and msms. Since ss is always 1/21/2 for electrons, it is redundant to list ss, and so we omit it and specify the state of an electron by a set of four numbers n,l,ml,msn,l,ml,ms. For example, the quantum numbers 2, 1, 0,−1/22, 1, 0,−1/2 completely specify the state of an electron in an atom. n, l,ml, sn, l,ml, s msms ss 1/21/2 ss n,l,ml,msn,l,ml,ms 2, 1, 0,−1/22, 1, 0,−1/2 Since no two electrons can have the same set of quantum numbers, there are limits to how many of them can be in the same energy state. Note that nn determines the energy state in the absence of a magnetic field. So we first choose nn, and then we see how many electrons can be in this energy state or energy level. Consider the n=1n=1 level, for example. The only value ll can have is 0 (see Table 30.1 for a list of possible values once nn is known), and thus mlml can only be 0. The spin projection msms can be either +1/2+1/2 or −1/2−1/2, and so there can be two electrons in the n=1n=1 state. One has quantum numbers 1, 0, 0,+1/21, 0, 0,+1/2, and the other has 1, 0, 0,−1/21, 0, 0,−1/2. Figure 30.55 illustrates that there can be one or two electrons having n=1n=1, but not three. nn nn n=1n=1 ll nn mlml msms +1/2+1/2 −1/2−1/2 n=1n=1 1, 0, 0,+1/21, 0, 0,+1/2 1, 0, 0,−1/21, 0, 0,−1/2 n=1n=1 Figure 30.55 The Pauli exclusion principle explains why some configurations of electrons are allowed while others are not. Since electrons cannot have the same set of quantum numbers, a maximum of two can be in the n=1n=1 level, and a third electron must reside in the higher-energy n=2n=2 level. If there are two electrons in the n=1n=1 level, their spins must be in opposite directions. (More precisely, their spin projections must differ.)"
Page 362,"No two electrons can have the same set of quantum numbers. That is, no two electrons can be in the same state."
Page 362,"Because of the Pauli exclusion principle, only hydrogen and helium can have all of their electrons in the n=1n=1 state. Lithium (see the periodic table) has three electrons, and so one must be in the n=2n=2 level. This leads to the concept of shells and shell filling. As we progress up in the number of electrons, we go from hydrogen to helium, lithium, beryllium, boron, and so on, and we see that there are limits to the number of electrons for each value of nn. Higher values of the shell nn correspond to higher energies, and they can allow more electrons because of the various combinations of l,mll,ml, and msms that are possible. Each value of the principal quantum number nn thus corresponds to an atomic shell into which a limited number of electrons can go. Shells and the number of electrons in them determine the physical and chemical properties of atoms, since it is the outermost electrons that interact most with anything outside the atom. n=1n=1 n=2n=2 nn nn l,mll,ml msms nn shell The probability clouds of electrons with the lowest value of ll are closest to the nucleus and, thus, more tightly bound. Thus when shells fill, they start with l=0l=0, progress to l=1l=1, and so on. Each value of ll thus corresponds to a subshell. ll l=0l=0 l=1l=1 ll subshell The table given below lists symbols traditionally used to denote shells and subshells. Table 30.2 Shell and Subshell Symbols To denote shells and subshells, we write nlnl with a number for nn and a letter for ll. For example, an electron in the n=1n=1 state must have l=0l=0, and it is denoted as a 1s1s electron. Two electrons in the n=1n=1 state is denoted as 1s21s2. Another example is an electron in the n=2n=2 state with l=1l=1, written as 2p2p. The case of three electrons with these quantum numbers is written 2p32p3. This notation, called spectroscopic notation, is generalized as shown in Figure 30.56. nlnl nn ll n=1n=1 l=0l=0 1s1s n=1n=1 1s21s2 n=2n=2 l=1l=1 2p2p 2p32p3 Figure 30.56 Counting the number of possible combinations of quantum numbers allowed by the exclusion principle, we can determine how many electrons it takes to fill each subshell and shell. Example 30.4 List all the possible sets of quantum numbers for the n=2n=2 shell, and determine the number of electrons that can be in the shell and each of its subshells. n=2n=2 Given n=2n=2 for the shell, the rules for quantum numbers limit ll to be 0 or 1. The shell therefore has two subshells, labeled 2s2s and 2p2p. Since the lowest ll subshell fills first, we start with the 2s2s subshell possibilities and then proceed with the 2p2p subshell. n=2n=2 ll 2s2s 2p2p ll 2s2s 2p2p It is convenient to list the possible quantum numbers in a table, as shown below. Figure 30.57 It is laborious to make a table like this every time we want to know how many electrons can be in a shell or subshell. There exist general rules that are easy to apply, as we shall now see. The number of electrons that can be in a subshell depends entirely on the value of ll. Once ll is known, there are a fixed number of values of mlml, each of which can have two values for msms First, since mlml goes from −l−l to l in steps of 1, there are 2l+12l+1 possibilities. This number is multiplied by 2, since each electron can be spin up or spin down. Thus the maximum number of electrons that can be in a subshell is 22l+122l+1. ll ll mlml msms mlml −l−l 2l+12l+1 22l+122l+1 For example, the 2s2s subshell in Example 30.4 has a maximum of 2 electrons in it, since 22l+1=20+1=222l+1=20+1=2 for this subshell. Similarly, the 2p2p subshell has a maximum of 6 electrons, since 22l+1=22+1=622l+1=22+1=6. For a shell, the maximum number is the sum of what can fit in the subshells. Some algebra shows that the maximum number of electrons that can be in a shell is 2n22n2. 2s2s 22l+1=20+1=222l+1=20+1=2 2p2p 22l+1=22+1=622l+1=22+1=6 2n22n2 For example, for the first shell n=1n=1, and so 2n2=22n2=2. We have already seen that only two electrons can be in the n=1n=1 shell. Similarly, for the second shell, n=2n=2, and so 2n2=82n2=8. As found in Example 30.4, the total number of electrons in the n=2n=2 shell is 8. n=1n=1 2n2=22n2=2 n=1n=1 n=2n=2 2n2=82n2=8 n=2n=2 Example 30.5 How many subshells are in the n=3n=3 shell? Identify each subshell, calculate the maximum number of electrons that will fit into each, and verify that the total is 2n22n2. n=3n=3 2n22n2 Subshells are determined by the value of ll; thus, we first determine which values of ll are allowed, and then we apply the equation “maximum number of electrons that can be in a subshell =22l+1=22l+1” to find the number of electrons in each subshell. ll ll =22l+1=22l+1 Since n=3n=3, we know that 
l
l can be
0, 10, 1, or
22; thus, there are three possible subshells. In standard notation, they are labeled the 3s3s, 3p3p, and 3d3d subshells. We have already seen that 2 electrons can be in an ss state, and 6 in a pp state, but let us use the equation “maximum number of electrons that can be in a subshell = 22l+122l+1” to calculate the maximum number in each: n=3n=3 l
l 0, 10, 1 22 3s3s 3p3p 3d3d ss pp 22l+122l+1 30.55 The equation “maximum number of electrons that can be in a shell = 2n22n2” gives the maximum number in the n=3n=3 shell to be 2n22n2 n=3n=3 30.56 The total number of electrons in the three possible subshells is thus the same as the formula 2n22n2. In standard (spectroscopic) notation, a filled n=3n=3 shell is denoted as 3s23p63d103s23p63d10.  Shells do not fill in a simple manner. Before the n=3n=3 shell is completely filled, for example, we begin to find electrons in the n=4n=4 shell. 2n22n2 n=3n=3 3s23p63d103s23p63d10 n=3n=3 n=4n=4"
Page 362,"Table 30.3 shows electron configurations for the first 20 elements in the periodic table, starting with hydrogen and its single electron and ending with calcium. The Pauli exclusion principle determines the maximum number of electrons allowed in each shell and subshell. But the order in which the shells and subshells are filled is complicated because of the large numbers of interactions between electrons. Table 30.3 Electron Configurations of Elements Hydrogen Through Calcium Examining the above table, you can see that as the number of electrons in an atom increases from 1 in hydrogen to 2 in helium and so on, the lowest-energy shell gets filled first—that is, the n=1n=1 shell fills first, and then the n=2n=2 shell begins to fill. Within a shell, the subshells fill starting with the lowest ll, or with the ss subshell, then the pp, and so on, usually until all subshells are filled. The first exception to this occurs for potassium, where the 4s4s subshell begins to fill before any electrons go into the 3d3d subshell. The next exception is not shown in Table 30.3; it occurs for rubidium, where the 5s5s subshell starts to fill before the 4d4d subshell. The reason for these exceptions is that l=0l=0 electrons have probability clouds that penetrate closer to the nucleus and, thus, are more tightly bound (lower in energy). n=1n=1 n=2n=2 ll ss pp 4s4s 3d3d 5s5s 4d4d l=0l=0 Figure 30.58 shows the periodic table of the elements, through element 118. Of special interest are elements in the main groups, namely, those in the columns numbered 1, 2, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18. Figure 30.58 Periodic table of the elements (credit: National Institute of Standards and Technology, U.S. Department of Commerce) The number of electrons in the outermost subshell determines the atom’s chemical properties, since it is these electrons that are farthest from the nucleus and thus interact most with other atoms. If the outermost subshell can accept or give up an electron easily, then the atom will be highly reactive chemically. Each group in the periodic table is characterized by its outermost electron configuration. Perhaps the most familiar is Group 18 (Group VIII), the noble gases (helium, neon, argon, etc.). These gases are all characterized by a filled outer subshell that is particularly stable. This means that they have large ionization energies and do not readily give up an electron. Furthermore, if they were to accept an extra electron, it would be in a significantly higher level and thus loosely bound. Chemical reactions often involve sharing electrons. Noble gases can be forced into unstable chemical compounds only under high pressure and temperature. Group 17 (Group VII) contains the halogens, such as fluorine, chlorine, iodine and bromine, each of which has one less electron than a neighboring noble gas. Each halogen has 5 pp electrons (a p5p5  configuration), while the pp subshell can hold 6 electrons. This means the halogens have one vacancy in their outermost subshell. They thus readily accept an extra electron (it becomes tightly bound, closing the shell as in noble gases) and are highly reactive chemically. The halogens are also likely to form singly negative ions, such as C1−C1−, fitting an extra electron into the vacancy in the outer subshell. In contrast, alkali metals, such as sodium and potassium, all have a single ss electron in their outermost subshell (an

As you might expect, they also tend to form singly positive ions, such as Na+Na+, by losing their loosely bound outermost electron. They are metals (conductors), because the loosely bound outer electron can move freely. pp p5p5 pp C1−C1− ss s

Carbon, in particular, is extraordinary in its ability to form many types of bonds and to be part of long chains, such as inorganic molecules. The large group of what are called transitional elements is characterized by the filling of the dd subshells and crossing of energy levels. Heavier groups, such as the lanthanide series, are more complex—their shells do not fill in simple order. But the groups recognized by chemists such as Mendeleev have an explanation in the substructure of atoms. dd"

Page 368,"In 1896, the French physicist Antoine Henri Becquerel (1852–1908) accidentally found that a uranium-rich mineral called pitchblende emits invisible, penetrating rays that can darken a photographic plate enclosed in an opaque envelope. The rays therefore carry energy; but amazingly, the pitchblende emits them continuously without any energy input. This is an apparent violation of the law of conservation of energy, one that we now understand is due to the conversion of a small amount of mass into energy, as related in Einstein’s famous equation E=mc2E=mc2. It was soon evident that Becquerel’s rays originate in the nuclei of the atoms and have other unique characteristics. The emission of these rays is called nuclear radioactivity or simply radioactivity. The rays themselves are called nuclear radiation. A nucleus that spontaneously destroys part of its mass to emit radiation is said to decay (a term also used to describe the emission of radiation by atoms in excited states). A substance or object that emits nuclear radiation is said to be radioactive. E=mc2E=mc2 radioactivity nuclear radiation decay radioactive Two types of experimental evidence imply that Becquerel’s rays originate deep in the heart (or nucleus) of an atom. First, the radiation is found to be associated with certain elements, such as uranium. Radiation does not vary with chemical state—that is, uranium is radioactive whether it is in the form of an element or compound. In addition, radiation does not vary with temperature, pressure, or ionization state of the uranium atom. Since all of these factors affect electrons in an atom, the radiation cannot come from electron transitions, as atomic spectra do. The huge energy emitted during each event is the second piece of evidence that the radiation cannot be atomic. Nuclear radiation has energies of the order of 106eV106eV per event, which is much greater than the typical atomic energies (a few eVeV), such as that observed in spectra and chemical reactions, and more than ten times as high as the most energetic characteristic x rays. Becquerel did not vigorously pursue his discovery for very long. In 1898, Marie Curie (1867–1934), then a graduate student married to the already well-known French physicist Pierre Curie (1859–1906), began her doctoral study of Becquerel’s rays. She and her husband soon discovered two new radioactive elements, which she named polonium (after her native land) and radium (because it radiates). These two new elements filled holes in the periodic table and, further, displayed much higher levels of radioactivity per gram of material than uranium. Over a period of four years, working under poor conditions and spending their own funds, the Curies processed more than a ton of uranium ore to isolate a gram of radium salt. Radium became highly sought after, because it was about two million times as radioactive as uranium. Curie’s radium salt glowed visibly from the radiation that took its toll on them and other unaware researchers. Shortly after completing her Ph.D., both Curies and Becquerel shared the 1903 Nobel Prize in physics for their work on radioactivity. Pierre was killed in a horse cart accident in 1906, but Marie continued her study of radioactivity for nearly 30 more years. Awarded the 1911 Nobel Prize in chemistry for her discovery of two new elements, she remains the only person to win Nobel Prizes in physics and chemistry. Marie’s radioactive fingerprints on some pages of her notebooks can still expose film, and she suffered from radiation-induced lesions. She died of leukemia likely caused by radiation, but she was active in research almost until her death in 1934. The following year, her daughter and son-in-law, Irene and Frederic Joliot-Curie, were awarded the Nobel Prize in chemistry for their discovery of artificially induced radiation, adding to a remarkable family legacy. 106eV106eV eVeV"
Page 368,"Research begun by people such as New Zealander Ernest Rutherford soon after the discovery of nuclear radiation indicated that different types of rays are emitted. Eventually, three types were distinguished and named alphaαα, betaββ, and gammaγγ, because, like x-rays, their identities were initially unknown. Figure 31.3 shows what happens if the rays are passed through a magnetic field. The γγs are unaffected, while the αα s and ββ s are deflected in opposite directions, indicating the αα s are positive, the ββ s negative, and the γγ s uncharged. Rutherford used both magnetic and electric fields to show that αα s have a positive charge twice the magnitude of an electron, or +2∣qe∣+2∣qe∣. In the process, he found the αα s charge to mass ratio to be several thousand times smaller than the electron’s. Later on, Rutherford collected αα s from a radioactive source and passed an electric discharge through them, obtaining the spectrum of recently discovered helium gas. Among many important discoveries made by Rutherford and his collaborators was the proof that αα radiation is the emission of a helium nucleus. Rutherford won the Nobel Prize in chemistry in 1908 for his early work. He continued to make important contributions until his death in 1934. alpha αα beta ββ gamma γγ γγ αα ββ αα ββ γγ αα +2∣qe∣+2∣qe∣ αα αα αα Figure 31.3 Alpha, beta, and gamma rays are passed through a magnetic field on the way to a phosphorescent screen. The αα s and ββ s bend in opposite directions, while the γγ s are unaffected, indicating a positive charge for αα s, negative for ββ s, and neutral for γγ s. Consistent results are obtained with electric fields. Collection of the radiation offers further confirmation from the direct measurement of excess charge. Other researchers had already proved that ββ s are negative and have the same mass and same charge-to-mass ratio as the recently discovered electron. By 1902, it was recognized that ββ radiation is the emission of an electron. Although ββ s are electrons, they do not exist in the nucleus before it decays and are not ejected atomic electrons—the electron is created in the nucleus at the instant of decay. ββ ββ ββ Since γγ s remain unaffected by electric and magnetic fields, it is natural to think they might be photons. Evidence for this grew, but it was not until 1914 that this was proved by Rutherford and collaborators. By scattering γγ radiation from a crystal and observing interference, they demonstrated that γγ radiation is the emission of a high-energy photon by a nucleus. In fact, γγ radiation comes from the de-excitation of a nucleus, just as an x ray comes from the de-excitation of an atom. The names ""γγ ray"" and ""x ray"" identify the source of the radiation. At the same energy, γγ rays and x rays are otherwise identical. γγ γγ γγ γγ γγ γγ Table 31.1 Properties of Nuclear Radiation"
Page 368,"Two of the most important characteristics of αα, ββ, and γγ rays were recognized very early. All three types of nuclear radiation produce ionization in materials, but they penetrate different distances in materials—that is, they have different ranges. Let us examine why they have these characteristics and what are some of the consequences. αα ββ γγ Like x rays, nuclear radiation in the form of αα s, ββ s, and γγ s has enough energy per event to ionize atoms and molecules in any material. The energy emitted in various nuclear decays ranges from a few keVkeV to more than 10 MeV10 MeV, while only a few eVeV are needed to produce ionization. The effects of x rays and nuclear radiation on biological tissues and other materials, such as solid state electronics, are directly related to the ionization they produce. All of them, for example, can damage electronics or kill cancer cells. In addition, methods for detecting x rays and nuclear radiation are based on ionization, directly or indirectly. All of them can ionize the air between the plates of a capacitor, for example, causing it to discharge. This is the basis of inexpensive personal radiation monitors, such as pictured in Figure 31.4. Apart from αα, ββ, and γγ, there are other forms of nuclear radiation as well, and these also produce ionization with similar effects. We define ionizing radiation as any form of radiation that produces ionization whether nuclear in origin or not, since the effects and detection of the radiation are related to ionization. αα ββ γγ keVkeV 10 MeV10 MeV eVeV αα ββ γγ ionizing radiation Figure 31.4 These dosimeters (literally, dose meters) are personal radiation monitors that detect the amount of radiation by the discharge of a rechargeable internal capacitor. The amount of discharge is related to the amount of ionizing radiation encountered, a measurement of dose. One dosimeter is shown in the charger. Its scale is read through an eyepiece on the top. (credit: L. Chang, Wikimedia Commons) The range of radiation is defined to be the distance it can travel through a material. Range is related to several factors, including the energy of the radiation, the material encountered, and the type of radiation (see Figure 31.5). The higher the energy, the greater the range, all other factors being the same. This makes good sense, since radiation loses its energy in materials primarily by producing ionization in them, and each ionization of an atom or a molecule requires energy that is removed from the radiation. The amount of ionization is, thus, directly proportional to the energy of the particle of radiation, as is its range. range of radiation Figure 31.5 The penetration or range of radiation depends on its energy, the material it encounters, and the type of radiation. (a) Greater energy means greater range. (b) Radiation has a smaller range in materials with high electron density. (c) Alphas have the smallest range, betas have a greater range, and gammas penetrate the farthest. Radiation can be absorbed or shielded by materials, such as the lead aprons dentists drape on us when taking x rays. Lead is a particularly effective shield compared with other materials, such as plastic or air. How does the range of radiation depend on material? Ionizing radiation interacts best with charged particles in a material. Since electrons have small masses, they most readily absorb the energy of the radiation in collisions. The greater the density of a material and, in particular, the greater the density of electrons within a material, the smaller the range of radiation. Collisions Conservation of energy and momentum often results in energy transfer to a less massive object in a collision. This was discussed in detail in Work, Energy, and Energy Resources, for example. Different types of radiation have different ranges when compared at the same energy and in the same material. Alphas have the shortest range, betas penetrate farther, and gammas have the greatest range. This is directly related to charge and speed of the particle or type of radiation. At a given energy, each
αα,
ββ, or
 γ γ will produce the same number of ionizations in a material (each ionization requires a certain amount of energy on average). The more readily the particle produces ionization, the more quickly it will lose its energy. The effect of charge is as follows: The αα has a charge of +2qe+2qe , the ββ has a charge of −qe−qe , and the γγ is uncharged. The electromagnetic force exerted by the αα is thus twice as strong as that exerted by the ββ and it is more likely to produce ionization. Although chargeless, the γγ does interact weakly because it is an electromagnetic wave, but it is less likely to produce ionization in any encounter. More quantitatively, the change in momentum ΔpΔp given to a particle in the material is Δp=FΔtΔp=FΔt, where FF is the force the
αα,
ββ, or
 γ γ exerts over a time
ΔtΔt. The smaller the charge, the smaller is FF and the smaller is the momentum (and energy) lost. Since the speed of alphas is about 5% to 10% of the speed of light, classical (non-relativistic) formulas apply. αα ββ γ γ αα +2qe+2qe ββ −qe−qe γγ αα ββ γγ ΔpΔp Δp=FΔtΔp=FΔt FF αα ββ γ γ ΔtΔt FF The speed at which they travel is the other major factor affecting the range of αα s, ββ s, and γγ s. The faster they move, the less time they spend in the vicinity of an atom or a molecule, and the less likely they are to interact. Since αα s and ββ s are particles with mass (helium nuclei and electrons, respectively), their energy is kinetic, given classically by 12mv212mv2. The mass of the ββ particle is thousands of times less than that of the αα s, so that ββ s must travel much faster than αα s to have the same energy. Since ββ s move faster (most at relativistic speeds), they have less time to interact than αα s. Gamma rays are photons, which must travel at the speed of light. They are even less likely to interact than a ββ, since they spend even less time near a given atom (and they have no charge). The range of γγ s is thus greater than the range of ββ s. αα ββ γγ αα ββ 12mv212mv2 ββ αα ββ αα ββ αα ββ γγ ββ Alpha radiation from radioactive sources has a range much less than a millimeter of biological tissues, usually not enough to even penetrate the dead layers of our skin. On the other hand, the same αα radiation can penetrate a few centimeters of air, so mere distance from a source prevents αα radiation from reaching us. This makes αα radiation relatively safe for our body compared to ββ and γγ radiation. Typical ββ radiation can penetrate a few millimeters of tissue or about a meter of air. Beta radiation is thus hazardous even when not ingested. The range of ββ s in lead is about a millimeter, and so it is easy to store  ββ sources in lead radiation-proof containers. Gamma rays have a much greater range than either ααs or ββs. In fact, if a given thickness of material, like a lead brick, absorbs 90% of the γγs, then a second lead brick will only absorb 90% of what got through the first. Thus, γγs do not have a well-defined range; we can only cut down the amount that gets through. Typically, γγs can penetrate many meters of air, go right through our bodies, and are effectively shielded (that is, reduced in intensity to acceptable levels) by many centimeters of lead. One benefit of γγs is that they can be used as radioactive tracers (see Figure 31.6). αα αα αα ββ γγ ββ ββ ββ αα ββ γγ γγ γγ γγ Figure 31.6 This image of the concentration of a radioactive tracer in a patient’s body reveals where the most active bone cells are, an indication of bone cancer.

Page 369,"The first direct detection of radiation was Becquerel’s fogged photographic plate. Photographic film is still the most common detector of ionizing radiation, being used routinely in medical and dental x rays. Nuclear radiation is also captured on film, such as seen in Figure 31.7. The mechanism for film exposure by ionizing radiation is similar to that by photons. A quantum of energy interacts with the emulsion and alters it chemically, thus exposing the film. The quantum  come from an αα-particle, ββ-particle, or photon, provided it has more than the few eV of energy needed to induce the chemical change (as does all ionizing radiation). The process is not 100% efficient, since not all incident radiation interacts and not all interactions produce the chemical change. The amount of film darkening is related to exposure, but the darkening also depends on the type of radiation, so that absorbers and other devices must be used to obtain energy, charge, and particle-identification information. αα ββ Figure 31.7 Film badges contain film similar to that used in  this dental x-ray film and is sandwiched between various absorbers to determine the penetrating ability of the radiation as well as the amount. (credit: Werneuchen, Wikimedia Commons) Another very common radiation detector is the Geiger tube. The clicking and buzzing sound we hear in dramatizations and documentaries, as well as in our own physics labs, is usually an audio output of events detected by a Geiger counter. These relatively inexpensive radiation detectors are based on the simple and sturdy Geiger tube, shown schematically in Figure 31.8(b). A conducting cylinder with a wire along its axis is filled with an insulating gas so that a voltage applied between the cylinder and wire produces almost no current. Ionizing radiation passing through the tube produces free ion pairs (each pair consisting of one positively charged particle and one negatively charged particle) that are attracted to the wire and cylinder, forming a current that is detected as a count. The word count implies that there is no information on energy, charge, or type of radiation with a simple Geiger counter. They do not detect every particle, since some radiation can pass through without producing enough ionization to be detected. However, Geiger counters are very useful in producing a prompt output that reveals the existence and relative intensity of ionizing radiation. radiation detector Geiger tube Figure 31.8 (a) Geiger counters such as this one are used for prompt monitoring of radiation levels, generally giving only relative intensity and not identifying the type or energy of the radiation. (credit: TimVickers, Wikimedia Commons) (b) Voltage applied between the cylinder and wire in a Geiger tube causes ions and electrons produced by radiation passing through the gas-filled cylinder to move towards them. The resulting current is detected and registered as a count. Another radiation detection method records light produced when radiation interacts with materials. The energy of the radiation is sufficient to excite atoms in a material that may fluoresce, such as the phosphor used by Rutherford’s group. Materials called scintillators use a more complex collaborative process to convert radiation energy into light. Scintillators may be liquid or solid, and they can be very efficient. Their light output can provide information about the energy, charge, and type of radiation. Scintillator light flashes are very brief in duration, enabling the detection of a huge number of particles in short periods of time. Scintillator detectors are used in a variety of research and diagnostic applications. Among these are the detection by satellite-mounted equipment of the radiation from distant galaxies, the analysis of radiation from a person indicating body burdens, and the detection of exotic particles in accelerator laboratories. scintillators Light from a scintillator is converted into electrical signals by devices such as the photomultiplier tube shown schematically in Figure 31.9. These tubes are based on the photoelectric effect, which is multiplied in stages into a cascade of electrons, hence the name photomultiplier. Light entering the photomultiplier strikes a metal plate, ejecting an electron that is attracted by a positive potential difference to the next plate, giving it enough energy to eject two or more electrons, and so on. The final output current can be made proportional to the energy of the light entering the tube, which is in turn proportional to the energy deposited in the scintillator. Very sophisticated information can be obtained with scintillators, including energy, charge, particle identification, direction of motion, and so on. photomultiplier Figure 31.9 Photomultipliers use the photoelectric effect on the photocathode to convert the light output of a scintillator into an electrical signal. Each successive dynode has a more-positive potential than the last and attracts the ejected electrons, giving them more energy. The number of electrons is thus multiplied at each dynode, resulting in an easily detected output current. Solid-state radiation detectors convert ionization produced in a semiconductor (like those found in computer chips) directly into an electrical signal. Semiconductors can be constructed that do not conduct current in one particular direction. When a voltage is applied in that direction, current flows only when ionization is produced by radiation, similar to what happens in a Geiger tube. Further, the amount of current in a solid-state detector is closely related to the energy deposited and, since the detector is solid, it can have a high efficiency (since ionizing radiation is stopped in a shorter distance in solids fewer particles escape detection). As with scintillators, very sophisticated information can be obtained from solid-state detectors. Solid-state radiation detectors"

Page 370,"What forces hold a nucleus together? The nucleus is very small and its protons, being positive, exert tremendous repulsive forces on one another. (The Coulomb force increases as charges get closer, since it is proportional to 1/r21/r2, even at the tiny distances found in nuclei.) The answer is that two previously unknown forces hold the nucleus together and make it into a tightly packed ball of nucleons. These forces are called the weak and strong nuclear forces. Nuclear forces are so short ranged that they fall to zero strength when nucleons are separated by only a few fm. However, like glue, they are strongly attracted when the nucleons get close to one another. The strong nuclear force is about 100 times more attractive than the repulsive EM force, easily holding the nucleons together. Nuclear forces become extremely repulsive if the nucleons get too close, making nucleons strongly resist being pushed inside one another, something like ball bearings. 1/r21/r2 The fact that nuclear forces are very strong is responsible for the very large energies emitted in nuclear decay. During decay, the forces do work, and since work is force times the distance (W=FdcosθW=Fdcosθ), a large force can result in a large emitted energy. In fact, we know that there are two distinct nuclear forces because of the different types of nuclear decay—the strong nuclear force is responsible for αα decay, while the weak nuclear force is responsible for ββ decay. W=FdcosθW=Fdcosθ αα ββ The many stable and unstable nuclei we have explored, and the hundreds we have not discussed, can be arranged in a table called the chart of the nuclides, a simplified version of which is shown in Figure 31.12. Nuclides are located on a plot of NN versus ZZ. Examination of a detailed chart of the nuclides reveals patterns in the characteristics of nuclei, such as stability, abundance, and types of decay, analogous to but more complex than the systematics in the periodic table of the elements. chart of the nuclides NN ZZ Figure 31.12 Simplified chart of the nuclides, a graph of NN versus ZZ for known nuclides. The patterns of stable and unstable nuclides reveal characteristics of the nuclear forces. The dashed line is for N=ZN=Z. Numbers along diagonals are mass numbers AA. In principle, a nucleus can have any combination of protons and neutrons, but Figure 31.12 shows a definite pattern for those that are stable. For low-mass nuclei, there is a strong tendency for NN and ZZ to be nearly equal. This means that the nuclear force is more attractive when N=ZN=Z. More detailed examination reveals greater stability when NN and ZZ are even numbers—nuclear forces are more attractive when neutrons and protons are in pairs. For increasingly higher masses, there are progressively more neutrons than protons in stable nuclei. This is due to the ever-growing repulsion between protons. Since nuclear forces are short ranged, and the Coulomb force is long ranged, an excess of neutrons keeps the protons a little farther apart, reducing Coulomb repulsion. Decay modes of nuclides out of the region of stability consistently produce nuclides closer to the region of stability. There are more stable nuclei having certain numbers of protons and neutrons, called magic numbers. Magic numbers indicate a shell structure for the nucleus in which closed shells are more stable. Nuclear shell theory has been very successful in explaining nuclear energy levels, nuclear decay, and the greater stability of nuclei with closed shells. We have been producing ever-heavier transuranic elements since the early 1940s, and we have now produced the element with Z=118Z=118. There are theoretical predictions of an island of relative stability for nuclei with such high ZZ s.

Page 371,"In alpha decay, a 4He4He nucleus simply breaks away from the parent nucleus, leaving a daughter with two fewer protons and two fewer neutrons than the parent (see Figure 31.15).

If you examine the periodic table of the elements, you will find that Th has Z=90Z=90, two fewer than U, which has Z=92Z=92. Similarly, in the second decay equation, we see that U has two fewer protons than Pu, which has Z=94Z=94. The general rule for αα decay is best written in the format ZAXNZAXN.

  that total charge is conserved. Linear and angular momentum are conserved, too. Although conserved angular momentum is not of great consequence in this type of decay, conservation of linear momentum has interesting consequences. If the nucleus is at rest when it decays, its momentum is zero. In that case, the fragments must fly in opposite directions with equal-magnitude momenta so that total momentum remains zero. This results in the αα particle carrying away most of the energy, as a bullet from a heavy rifle carries away most of the energy of the powder burned to shoot it. Total mass–energy is also conserved: the energy produced in the decay comes from conversion of a fraction of the original mass. As discussed in Atomic Physics, the general relationship is αα ZA

When the final products have less total mass, ΔmΔm is positive, and the reaction releases energy (is exothermic). When the products have greater total mass, the reaction is endothermic (ΔmΔm is negative) and must be induced with an energy input.

Page 371,"There are actually three types of beta decay. The first discovered was “ordinary” beta decay and is called β−β− decay or electron emission. The symbol β−β− represents an electron emitted in nuclear beta decay. Cobalt-60 is a nuclide that β−β− decays in the following manner: beta decay β−β− β−β− β−β− 31.21 The neutrino is a particle emitted in beta decay that was unanticipated and is of fundamental importance. The neutrino was not even proposed in theory until more than 20 years after beta decay was known to involve electron emissions. Neutrinos are so difficult to detect that the first direct evidence of them was not obtained until 1953. Neutrinos are nearly massless, have no charge, and do not interact with nucleons via the strong nuclear force. Traveling approximately at the speed of light, they have little time to affect any nucleus they encounter. This is, owing to the fact that they have no charge (and they are not EM waves), they do not interact through the EM force. They do interact via the relatively weak and very short range weak nuclear force. Consequently, neutrinos escape almost any detector and penetrate almost any shielding. However, neutrinos do carry energy, angular momentum (they are fermions with half-integral spin), and linear momentum away from a beta decay. When accurate measurements of beta decay were made, it became apparent that energy, angular momentum, and linear momentum were not accounted for by the daughter nucleus and electron alone. Either a previously unsuspected particle was carrying them away, or three conservation laws were being violated. Wolfgang Pauli made a formal proposal for the existence of neutrinos in 1930. The Italian-born American physicist Enrico Fermi (1901–1954) gave neutrinos their name, meaning little neutral ones, when he developed a sophisticated theory of beta decay (see Figure 31.16). Part of Fermi’s theory was the identification of the weak nuclear force as being distinct from the strong nuclear force and in fact responsible for beta decay. Chinese-born physicist Chien-Shiung Wu, who had developed a number of processes critical to the Manhattan Project and related research, set out to investigate Fermi’s theory and some experiments whose failures had cast the theory in doubt. She first identified a number of flaws in her contemporaries’ methods and materials, and then designed an experimental method that would avoid the same errors. Wu verified Fermi’s theory and went on to establish the core principles of beta decay, which would become critical to further work in nuclear physics. neutrino Figure 31.16 (a) Enrico Fermi made significant contributions both as an experimentalist and a theorist. His many contributions to theoretical physics included the identification of the weak nuclear force. The fermi (fm) is named after him, as are an entire class of subatomic particles (fermions), an element (Fermium), and a major research laboratory (Fermilab). (credit: United States Department of Energy, Office of Public Affairs). (b) Chien-Shiung Wu undertook the experimentation to verify Fermi’s theory of beta decay. She became the world’s expert on the subject, and contributed to work that led to a Nobel Prize, even though she was denied the award. (credit: Smithsonian Institute) The neutrino also reveals a new conservation law. There are various families of particles, one of which is the electron family. We propose that the number of members of the electron family is constant in any process or any closed system. In our example of beta decay, there are no members of the electron family present before the decay, but after, there is an electron and a neutrino. So electrons are given an electron family number of +1+1. The neutrino in β−β− decay is an electron’s antineutrino, given the symbol ν¯eν¯e, where νν is the Greek letter nu, and the subscript e means this neutrino is related to the electron. The bar indicates this is a particle of antimatter. (All particles have antimatter counterparts that are nearly identical except that they have the opposite charge. Antimatter is almost entirely absent on Earth, but it is found in nuclear decay and other nuclear and particle reactions as well as in outer space.) The electron’s antineutrino ν¯eν¯e, being antimatter, has an electron family number of –1–1. The total is zero, before and after the decay. The new conservation law, obeyed in all circumstances, states that the total electron family number is constant. An electron cannot be created without also creating an antimatter family member. This law is analogous to the conservation of charge in a situation where total charge is originally zero, and equal amounts of positive and negative charge must be created in a reaction to keep the total zero. +1+1 β−β− electron’s antineutrino ν¯eν¯e νν antimatter ν¯eν¯e –1–1 If a nuclide ZAXNZAXN is known to β−β− decay, then its β−β− decay equation is ZAXNZAXN β−β− β−β− 31.22 where Y is the nuclide having one more proton than X (see Figure 31.17). So if you know that a certain nuclide β−β− decays, you can find the daughter nucleus by first looking up
ZZ for the parent and then determining which element has atomic number
Z+1Z+1. In the example of the
β−β− decay of
60Co60Co given earlier, we see that Z=27Z=27 for Co and
Z=28Z=28 is Ni. It is as if one of the neutrons in the parent nucleus decays into a proton, electron, and neutrino. In fact, neutrons outside of nuclei do just that—they live only an average of a few minutes and
β−β− decay in the following manner: β−β− ZZ Z+1Z+1 β−β− 60Co60Co Z=27Z=27 Z=28Z=28 β−β− 31.23 Figure 31.17 In β−β− decay, the parent nucleus emits an electron and an antineutrino. The daughter nucleus has one more proton and one less neutron than its parent. Neutrinos interact so weakly that they are almost never directly observed, but they play a fundamental role in particle physics. We see that charge is conserved in β−β− decay, since the total charge is ZZ before and after the decay. For example, in 60Co60Co decay, total charge is 27 before decay, since cobalt has
Z=27Z=27. After decay, the daughter nucleus is Ni, which has
Z=28Z=28, and there is an electron, so that the total charge is also 28 + (–1)28 + (–1) or 27. Angular momentum is conserved, but not obviously (you have to examine the spins and angular momenta of the final products in detail to verify this). Linear momentum is also conserved, again imparting most of the decay energy to the electron and the antineutrino, since they are of low and zero mass, respectively. Another new conservation law is obeyed here and elsewhere in nature. The total number of nucleons AA is conserved. In
60Co60Co decay, for example, there are 60 nucleons before and after the decay. Note that total
AA is also conserved in
αα decay. Also note that the total number of protons changes, as does the total number of neutrons, so that total
ZZ and total NN are not conserved in β−β− decay, as they are in αα decay. Energy released in β−β− decay can be calculated given the masses of the parent and products. β−β− ZZ 60Co60Co Z=27Z=27 Z=28Z=28 28 + (–1)28 + (–1) AA 60Co60Co AA αα ZZ NN β−β− αα β−β− Example 31.3 Find the energy emitted in the β−β− decay of 60Co60Co. β−β− 60Co60Co As in the preceding example, we must first find ΔmΔm, the difference in mass between the parent nucleus and the products of the decay, using masses given in Appendix A. Then the emitted energy is calculated as before, using E=(Δm)c2E=(Δm)c2. The initial mass is just that of the parent nucleus, and the final mass is that of the daughter nucleus and the electron created in the decay. The neutrino is massless, or nearly so. However, since the masses given in Appendix A are for neutral atoms, the daughter nucleus has one more electron than the parent, and so the extra electron mass that corresponds to the β–β– is included in the atomic mass of Ni. Thus, ΔmΔm E=(Δm)c2E=(Δm)c2 β–β– 31.24 The β−β− decay equation for 60Co60Co is β−β− 60Co60Co 31.25 As noticed, 31.26 Entering the masses found in Appendix A gives 31.27 Thus, 31.28 Using 1 u=931.5 MeV/c21 u=931.5 MeV/c2, we obtain 1 u=931.5 MeV/c21 u=931.5 MeV/c2 31.29 Perhaps the most difficult thing about this example is convincing yourself that the β−β− mass is included in the atomic mass of 60Ni60Ni. Beyond that are other implications. Again the decay energy is in the MeV range. This energy is shared by all of the products of the decay. In many 60Co60Co decays, the daughter nucleus 60Ni60Ni is left in an excited state and emits photons (
γγ rays). Most of the remaining energy goes to the electron and neutrino, since the recoil kinetic energy of the daughter nucleus is small. One final note: the electron emitted in β−β− decay is created in the nucleus at the time of decay. β−β− 60Ni60Ni 60Co60Co 60Ni60Ni γγ β−β− The second type of beta decay is less common than the first. It is β+β+decay. Certain nuclides decay by the emission of a positive electron. This is antielectron or positron decay (see Figure 31.18). β+β+ antielectron positron decay Figure 31.18 β+β+ decay is the emission of a positron that eventually finds an electron to annihilate, characteristically producing gammas in opposite directions. The antielectron is often represented by the symbol e+e+, but in beta decay it is written as β+β+ to indicate the antielectron was emitted in a nuclear decay. Antielectrons are the antimatter counterpart to electrons, being nearly identical, having the same mass, spin, and so on, but having a positive charge and an electron family number of –1–1. When a positron encounters an electron, there is a mutual annihilation in which all the mass of the antielectron-electron pair is converted into pure photon energy. (The reaction, e++e−→γ+γe++e−→γ+γ, conserves electron family number as well as all other conserved quantities.) If a nuclide ZAXNZAXN is known to β+β+ decay, then its β+β+decay equation is e+e+ β+β+ –1–1 positron e++e−→γ+γe++e−→γ+γ ZAXNZAXN β+β+ β+β+ decay equation 31.30 where Y is the nuclide having one less proton than X (to conserve charge) and νeνe is the symbol for the electron’s neutrino, which has an electron family number of +1+1. Since an antimatter member of the electron family (the β+β+) is created in the decay, a matter member of the family (here the νeνe) must also be created. Given, for example, that
22Na22Na
β+β+ decays, you can write its full decay equation by first finding that Z=11Z=11 for 22Na22Na, so that the daughter nuclide will have
Z=10Z=10, the atomic number for neon. Thus the β+β+ decay equation for 22Na22Na is νeνe electron’s neutrino +1+1 β+β+ νeνe 22Na22Na β+β+ Z=11Z=11 22Na22Na Z=10Z=10 β+β+ 22Na22Na 31.31 In β+β+ decay, it is as if one of the protons in the parent nucleus decays into a neutron, a positron, and a neutrino. Protons do not do this outside of the nucleus, and so the decay is due to the complexities of the nuclear force. Note again that the total number of nucleons is constant in this and any other reaction. To find the energy emitted in β+β+ decay, you must again count the number of electrons in the neutral atoms, since atomic masses are used. The daughter has one less electron than the parent, and one electron mass is created in the decay. Thus, in β+β+ decay, β+β+ β+β+ β+β+ 31.32 since we use the masses of neutral atoms. Electron capture is the third type of beta decay. Here, a nucleus captures an inner-shell electron and undergoes a nuclear reaction that has the same effect as β+β+ decay. Electron capture is sometimes denoted by the letters EC. We know that electrons cannot reside in the nucleus, but this is a nuclear reaction that consumes the electron and occurs spontaneously only when the products have less mass than the parent plus the electron. If a nuclide ZAXNZAXN is known to undergo electron capture, then its electron capture equation is Electron capture β+β+ ZAXNZAXN electron capture equation 31.33 Any nuclide that can β+β+ decay can also undergo electron capture (and often does both). The same conservation laws are obeyed for EC as for β+β+ decay. It is good practice to confirm these for yourself. β+β+ β+β+ All forms of beta decay occur because the parent nuclide is unstable and lies outside the region of stability in the chart of nuclides. Those nuclides that have relatively more neutrons than those in the region of stability will β−β− decay to produce a daughter with fewer neutrons, producing a daughter nearer the region of stability. Similarly, those nuclides having relatively more protons than those in the region of stability will β−β− decay or undergo electron capture to produce a daughter with fewer protons, nearer the region of stability. β−β− β−β−"
Page 371,"Gamma decay is the simplest form of nuclear decay—it is the emission of energetic photons by nuclei left in an excited state by some earlier process. Protons and neutrons in an excited nucleus are in higher orbitals, and they fall to lower levels by photon emission (analogous to electrons in excited atoms). Nuclear excited states have lifetimes typically of only about 10−1410−14 s, an indication of the great strength of the forces pulling the nucleons to lower states. The γγ decay equation is simply Gamma decay 10−1410−14 γγ 31.34 where the asterisk indicates the nucleus is in an excited state. There may be one or more γγ s emitted, depending on how the nuclide de-excites. In radioactive decay, γγ emission is common and is preceded by γγ or ββ decay. For example, when 60Co60Co β−β− decays, it most often leaves the daughter nucleus in an excited state, written 60Ni*60Ni*. Then the nickel nucleus quickly γγ decays by the emission of two penetrating γγ s: γγ γγ γγ ββ 60Co60Co β−β− 60Ni*60Ni* γγ γγ 31.35 These are called cobalt γγ rays, although they come from nickel—they are used for cancer therapy, for example. It is again constructive to verify the conservation laws for gamma decay. Finally, since γγ decay does not change the nuclide to another species, it is not prominently featured in charts of decay series, such as that in Figure 31.14. γγ γγ There are other types of nuclear decay, but they occur less commonly than αα,

ββ, and γγ decay. Spontaneous fission is the most important of the other forms of nuclear decay because of its applications in nuclear power and weapons. It is covered in the next chapter. αα ββ γγ"

Page 372,"Why use a term like half-life rather than lifetime? The answer can be found by examining Figure 31.19, which shows how the number of radioactive nuclei in a sample decreases with time. The time in which half of the original number of nuclei decay is defined as the half-life, t1/2t1/2. Half of the remaining nuclei decay in the next half-life. Further, half of that amount decays in the following half-life. Therefore, the number of radioactive nuclei decreases from NN to N/2N/2 in one half-life, then to N/4N/4 in the next, and to N/8N/8 in the next, and so on. If NN is a large number, then many half-lives (not just two) pass before all of the nuclei decay. Nuclear decay is an example of a purely statistical process. A more precise definition of half-life is that each nucleus has a 50% chance of living for a time equal to one half-life t1/2t1/2. Thus, if NN is reasonably large, half of the original nuclei decay in a time of one half-life. If an individual nucleus makes it through that time, it still has a 50% chance of surviving through another half-life. Even if it happens to make it through hundreds of half-lives, it still has a 50% chance of surviving through one more. The probability of decay is the same no matter when you start counting. This is like random coin flipping. The chance of heads is 50%, no matter what has happened before. half-life t1/2t1/2 NN N/2N/2 N/4N/4 N/8N/8 NN t1/2t1/2 NN Figure 31.19 Radioactive decay reduces the number of radioactive nuclei over time. In one half-life t1/2t1/2, the number decreases to half of its original value. Half of what remains decay in the next half-life, and half of those in the next, and so on. This is an exponential decay, as seen in the graph of the number of nuclei present as a function of time. There is a tremendous range in the half-lives of various nuclides, from as short as 10−2310−23 s for the most unstable, to more than 10161016 y for the least unstable, or about 46 orders of magnitude. Nuclides with the shortest half-lives are those for which the nuclear forces are least attractive, an indication of the extent to which the nuclear force can depend on the particular combination of neutrons and protons. The concept of half-life is applicable to other subatomic particles, as will be discussed in Particle Physics. It is also applicable to the decay of excited states in atoms and nuclei. The following equation gives the quantitative relationship between the original number of nuclei present at time zero (N0N0) and the number (NN) at a later time tt: 10−2310−23 10161016 N0N0 NN tt 31.36 where e=2.71828...e=2.71828... is the base of the natural logarithm, and λλ is the decay constant for the nuclide. The shorter the half-life, the larger is the value of λλ, and the faster the exponential e−λte−λt decreases with time. The relationship between the decay constant λλ and the half-life t1/2t1/2 is e=2.71828...e=2.71828... λλ decay constant λλ e−λte−λt λλ t1/2t1/2 31.37 To see how the number of nuclei declines to half its original value in one half-life, let t=t1/2t=t1/2 in the exponential in the equation N=N0e−λt

=0.500N0. For integral numbers of half-lives, you can just divide the original number by 2 over and over again, rather than using the exponential relationship. For example, if ten half-lives have passed, we divide NN by 2 ten times. This reduces it to N/1024N/1024. For an arbitrary time, not just a multiple of the half-life, the exponential relationship must be used. t=t1/2t=t1/2 N=N0e−λt

=0.500N0 NN N/1024N/1024 Radioactive dating is a clever use of naturally occurring radioactivity. Its most famous application is carbon-14 dating. Carbon-14 has a half-life of 5730 years and is produced in a nuclear reaction induced when solar neutrinos strike 14N14N in the atmosphere. Radioactive carbon has the same chemistry as stable carbon, and so it mixes into the ecosphere, where it is consumed and becomes part of every living organism. Carbon-14 has an abundance of 1.3 parts per trillion of normal carbon. Thus, if you know the number of carbon nuclei in an object (perhaps determined by mass and Avogadro’s number), you multiply that number by 1.3×10−121.3×10−12 to find the number of
14C14C nuclei in the object. When an organism dies, carbon exchange with the environment ceases, and
14C14C is not replenished as it decays. By comparing the abundance of
14C14C in an artifact, such as mummy wrappings, with the normal abundance in living tissue, it is possible to determine the artifact’s age (or time since death). Carbon-14 dating can be used for biological tissues as old as 50 or 60 thousand years, but is most accurate for younger samples, since the abundance of
14C14C nuclei in them is greater. Very old biological materials contain no
14C14C at all. There are instances in which the date of an artifact can be determined by other means, such as historical knowledge or tree-ring counting. These cross-references have confirmed the validity of carbon-14 dating and permitted us to calibrate the technique as well. Carbon-14 dating revolutionized parts of archaeology and is of such importance that it earned the 1960 Nobel Prize in chemistry for its developer, the American chemist Willard Libby (1908–1980). Radioactive dating carbon-14 dating 14N14N 1.3×10−121.3×10−12 14C14C 14C14C 14C14C 14C14C 14C14C One of the most famous cases of carbon-14 dating involves the Shroud of Turin, a long piece of fabric purported to be the burial shroud of Jesus (see Figure 31.20). This relic was first displayed in Turin in 1354 and was denounced as a fraud at that time by a French bishop. Its remarkable negative imprint of an apparently crucified body resembles the then-accepted image of Jesus, and so the shroud was never disregarded completely and remained controversial over the centuries. Carbon-14 dating was not performed on the shroud until 1988, when the process had been refined to the point where only a small amount of material needed to be destroyed. Samples were tested at three independent laboratories, each being given four pieces of cloth, with only one unidentified piece from the shroud, to avoid prejudice. All three laboratories found samples of the shroud contain 92% of the 14C14C found in living tissues, allowing the shroud to be dated (see Example 31.4). 14C14C Figure 31.20 Part of the Shroud of Turin, which shows a remarkable negative imprint likeness of Jesus complete with evidence of crucifixion wounds. The shroud first surfaced in the 14th century and was only recently carbon-14 dated. It has not been determined how the image was placed on the material. (credit: Butko, Wikimedia Commons) Example 31.4 Calculate the age of the Shroud of Turin given that the amount of 14C14C found in it is 92% of that in living tissue. 14C14C Knowing that 92% of the 14C14C remains means that N/N0=0.92N/N0=0.92. Therefore, the equation N=N0e−λtN=N0e−λt can be used to find λtλt. We also know that the half-life of 14C14C is 5730 y, and so once λtλt is known, we can use the equation λ=0.693t1/2λ=0.693t1/2 to find λλ and then find tt as requested. Here, we postulate that the decrease in 14C14C is solely due to nuclear decay. 14C14C N/N0=0.92N/N0=0.92 N=N0e−λtN=N0e−λt λtλt 14C14C λtλt λ=0.693t1/2λ=0.693t1/2 λλ tt 14C14C Solving the equation N=N0e−λtN=N0e−λt for N/N0N/N0 gives N=N0e−λtN=N0e−λt N/N0N/N0 31.38 Thus, 31.39 Taking the natural logarithm of both sides of the equation yields 31.40 so that 31.41 Rearranging to isolate tt gives tt 31.42 Now, the equation λ=0.693t1/2λ=0.693t1/2 can be used to find λλ for 14C14C. Solving for λλ and substituting the known half-life gives λ=0.693t1/2λ=0.693t1/2 λλ 14C14C λλ 31.43 We enter this value into the previous equation to find tt: tt 31.44 This dates the material in the shroud to 1988–690 = a.d. 1300. Our calculation is only accurate to two digits, so that the year is rounded to 1300. The values obtained at the three independent laboratories gave a weighted average date of a.d. 1320±601320±60. The uncertainty is typical of carbon-14 dating and is due to the small amount of 14C14C in living tissues, the amount of material available, and experimental uncertainties (reduced by having three independent measurements). It is meaningful that the date of the shroud is consistent with the first record of its existence and inconsistent with the period in which Jesus lived. 1320±601320±60 14C14C There are other forms of radioactive dating. Rocks, for example, can sometimes be dated based on the decay of 238U238U. The decay series for 238U238U ends with 206Pb206Pb, so that the ratio of these nuclides in a rock is an indication of how long it has been since the rock solidified. The original composition of the rock, such as the absence of lead, must be known with some confidence. However, as with carbon-14 dating, the technique can be verified by a consistent body of knowledge. Since 238U238U has a half-life of 4.5×1094.5×109 y, it is useful for dating only very old materials, showing, for example, that the oldest rocks on Earth solidified about 3.5×1093.5×109 years ago. 238U238U 238U238U 206Pb206Pb 238U238U 4.5×1094.5×109 3.5×1093.5×109"

Page 372,"What do we mean when we say a source is highly radioactive? Generally, this means the number of decays per unit time is very high. We define activity RR to be the rate of decay expressed in decays per unit time. In equation form, this is activity RR rate of decay 31.45 where ΔNΔN is the number of decays that occur in time ΔtΔt. The SI unit for activity is one decay per second and is given the name becquerel (Bq) in honor of the discoverer of radioactivity. That is, ΔNΔN ΔtΔt becquerel 31.46 Activity RR is often expressed in other units, such as decays per minute or decays per year. One of the most common units for activity is the curie (Ci), defined to be the activity of 1 g of 226Ra226Ra, in honor of Marie Curie’s work with radium. The definition of curie is RR curie 226Ra226Ra 31.47 or 3.70×10103.70×1010 decays per second. A curie is a large unit of activity, while a becquerel is a relatively small unit. 1 MBq=100 microcuries (μCi)1 MBq=100 microcuries (μCi). In countries like Australia and New Zealand that adhere more to SI units, most radioactive sources, such as those used in medical diagnostics or in physics laboratories, are labeled in Bq or megabecquerel (MBq). 3.70×10103.70×1010 1 MBq=100 microcuries (μCi)1 MBq=100 microcuries (μCi) Intuitively, you would expect the activity of a source to depend on two things: the amount of the radioactive substance present, and its half-life. The greater the number of radioactive nuclei present in the sample, the more will decay per unit of time. The shorter the half-life, the more decays per unit time, for a given number of nuclei. So activity RR should be proportional to the number of radioactive nuclei, NN, and inversely proportional to their half-life, t1/2t1/2. In fact, your intuition is correct. It can be shown that the activity of a source is RR NN t1/2t1/2 31.48 where NN is the number of radioactive nuclei present, having half-life t1/2t1/2. This relationship is useful in a variety of calculations, as the next two examples illustrate. NN t1/2t1/2 Example 31.5 Calculate the activity due to 14C14C in 1.00 kg of carbon found in a living organism. Express the activity in units of Bq and Ci. 14C14C To find the activity RR using the equation R=0.693Nt1/2R=0.693Nt1/2, we must know NN and t1/2t1/2. The half-life of 14C14C can be found in Appendix B, and was stated above as 5730 y. To find NN, we first find the number of 12C12C nuclei in 1.00 kg of carbon using the concept of a mole. As indicated, we then multiply by 1.3×10−121.3×10−12 (the abundance of 14C14C in a carbon sample from a living organism) to get the number of 14C14C nuclei in a living organism.

(A mole has a mass in grams equal in magnitude to AA found in the periodic table.) Thus the number of carbon nuclei in a kilogram is 12C12C AA 31.49 So the number of 14C14C nuclei in 1 kg of carbon is 14C14C 31.50 Now the activity RR is found using the equation R=0.693Nt1/2R=0.693Nt1/2. RR R=0.693Nt1/2R=0.693Nt1/2 Entering known values gives 31.51 or 7.89×1097.89×109 decays per year. To convert this to the unit Bq, we simply convert years to seconds. Thus, 7.89×1097.89×109 31.52 or 250 decays per second. To express RR in curies, we use the definition of a curie, RR 31.53 Thus, 31.54 Our own bodies contain kilograms of carbon, and it is intriguing to think there are hundreds of 14C14C decays per second taking place in us. Carbon-14 and other naturally occurring radioactive substances in our bodies contribute to the background radiation we receive. The small number of decays per second found for a kilogram of carbon in this example gives you some idea of how difficult it is to detect 14C14C in a small sample of material. If there are 250 decays per second in a kilogram, then there are 0.25 decays per second in a gram of carbon in living tissue. To observe this, you must be able to distinguish decays from other forms of radiation, in order to reduce background noise. This becomes more difficult with an old tissue sample, since it contains less 14C14C, and for samples more than 50 thousand years old, it is impossible. 14C14C 14C14C 14C14C Human-made (or artificial) radioactivity has been produced for decades and has many uses. Some of these include medical therapy for cancer, medical imaging and diagnostics, and food preservation by irradiation. Many applications as well as the biological effects of radiation are explored in Medical Applications of Nuclear Physics, but it is clear that radiation is hazardous. A number of tragic examples of this exist, one of the most disastrous being the meltdown and fire at the Chernobyl reactor complex in the Ukraine (see Figure 31.21). Several radioactive isotopes were released in huge quantities, contaminating many thousands of square kilometers and directly affecting hundreds of thousands of people. The most significant releases were of 131I131I, 90Sr90Sr, 137Cs137Cs, 239Pu239Pu, 238U238U, and 235U235U. Estimates are that the total amount of radiation released was about 100 million curies. 131I131I 90Sr90Sr 137Cs137Cs 239Pu239Pu 238U238U 235U235U"

Six megacuries (6.0 MCi) is an extraordinary amount of activity but is only a fraction of what is produced in nuclear reactors. Similar amounts of the other isotopes were also released at Chernobyl. Although the chances of such a disaster may have seemed small, the consequences were extremely severe, requiring greater caution than was used. More will be said about safe reactor design in the next chapter, but it should be noted that more recent reactors have a fundamentally safer design. Activity RR decreases in time, going to half its original value in one half-life, then to one-fourth its original value in the next half-life, and so on. Since R=0.693Nt1/2R=0.693Nt1/2, the activity decreases as the number of radioactive nuclei decreases. The equation for RR as a function of time is found by combining the equations N=N0e−λtN=N0e−λt and R=0.693Nt1/2R=0.693Nt1/2, yielding RR R=0.693Nt1/2R=0.693Nt1/2 RR N=N0e−λtN=N0e−λt R=0.693Nt1/2R=0.693Nt1/2 31.59 where R0R0 is the activity at t=0t=0. This equation shows exponential decay of radioactive nuclei. For example, if a source originally has a 1.00-mCi activity, it declines to 0.500 mCi in one half-life, to 0.250 mCi in two half-lives, to 0.125 mCi in three half-lives, and so on. For times other than whole half-lives, the equation R=R0e−λtR=R0e−λt must be used to find RR. R0R0 t=0t=0 R=R0e−λtR=R0e−λt RR"

Page 373,"Nuclear Decay Helps Explain Earth’s Hot Interior A puzzle created by radioactive dating of rocks is resolved by radioactive heating of Earth’s interior. This intriguing story is another example of how small-scale physics can explain large-scale phenomena. Radioactive dating plays a role in determining the approximate age of the Earth. The oldest rocks on Earth solidified about 3.5×1093.5×109 years ago—a number determined by uranium-238 dating. These rocks could only have solidified once the surface of the Earth had cooled sufficiently. The temperature of the Earth at formation can be estimated based on gravitational potential energy of the assemblage of pieces being converted to thermal energy. Using heat transfer concepts discussed in Thermodynamics it is then possible to calculate how long it would take for the surface to cool to rock-formation temperatures. The result is about 109109 years. The first rocks formed have been solid for 3.5×1093.5×109 years, so that the age of the Earth is approximately 4.5×1094.5×109 years. There is a large body of other types of evidence (both Earth-bound and solar system characteristics are used) that supports this age. The puzzle is that, given its age and initial temperature, the center of the Earth should be much cooler than it is today (see Figure 31.23). 3.5×1093.5×109 109109 3.5×1093.5×109 4.5×1094.5×109 Figure 31.23 The center of the Earth cools by well-known heat transfer methods. Convection in the liquid regions and conduction move thermal energy to the surface, where it radiates into cold, dark space. Given the age of the Earth and its initial temperature, it should have cooled to a lower temperature by now. The blowup shows that nuclear decay releases energy in the Earth’s interior. This energy has slowed the cooling process and is responsible for the interior still being molten. Danish geophysicist Inge Lehmann was the first to properly interpret seismological data from earthquakes as evidence that the Earth had a solid inner core surrounded by a liquid outer core. Shear or transverse waves cannot travel through a liquid and are not transmitted through the Earth’s core. Yet compression or longitudinal waves can pass through a liquid and do go through the core. From this information, the temperature of the interior can be estimated. As noticed, the interior should have cooled more from its initial temperature in the 4.5×1094.5×109 years since its formation. In fact, it should have taken no more than about 109109 years to cool to its present temperature. What is keeping it hot? The answer seems to be radioactive decay of primordial elements that were part of the material that formed the Earth (see the blowup in Figure 31.23). 4.5×1094.5×109 109109 Nuclides such as 238U238U and 40K40K have half-lives similar to or longer than the age of the Earth, and their decay still contributes energy to the interior. Some of the primordial radioactive nuclides have unstable decay products that also release energy— 238U238U has a long decay chain of these. Further, there were more of these primordial radioactive nuclides early in the life of the Earth, and thus the activity and energy contributed were greater then (perhaps by an order of magnitude). The amount of power created by these decays per cubic meter is very small. However, since a huge volume of material lies deep below the surface, this relatively small amount of energy cannot escape quickly. The power produced near the surface has much less distance to go to escape and has a negligible effect on surface temperatures. 238U238U 40K40K 238U238U A final effect of this trapped radiation merits mention. Alpha decay produces helium nuclei, which form helium atoms when they are stopped and capture electrons. Most of the helium on Earth is obtained from wells and is produced in this manner. Any helium in the atmosphere will escape in geologically short times because of its high thermal velocity."

Page 380,"Table 32.1 lists certain medical diagnostic uses of radiopharmaceuticals, including isotopes and activities that are typically administered. Many organs can be imaged with a variety of nuclear isotopes replacing a stable element by a radioactive isotope. One common diagnostic employs iodine to image the thyroid, since iodine is concentrated in that organ. The most active thyroid cells, including cancerous cells, concentrate the most iodine and, therefore, emit the most radiation. Conversely, hypothyroidism is indicated by lack of iodine uptake. Note that there is more than one isotope that can be used for several types of scans. Another common nuclear diagnostic is the thallium scan for the cardiovascular system, particularly used to evaluate blockages in the coronary arteries and examine heart activity. The salt TlCl can be used, because it acts like NaCl and follows the blood. Gallium-67 accumulates where there is rapid cell growth, such as in tumors and sites of infection. Hence, it is useful in cancer imaging. Usually, the patient receives the injection one day and has a whole body scan 3 or 4 days later because it can take several days for the gallium to build up. Table 32.1 Diagnostic Uses of Radiopharmaceuticals Note that Table 32.1 lists many diagnostic uses for 99mTc99mTc, where “m” stands for a metastable state of the technetium nucleus. Perhaps 80 percent of all radiopharmaceutical procedures employ 99mTc99mTc because of its many advantages. One is that the decay of its metastable state produces a single, easily identified 0.142-MeV

γγ ray. Additionally, the radiation dose to the patient is limited by the short 6.0-h half-life of

99mTc99mTc. And, although its half-life is short, it is easily and continuously produced on site. The basic process for production is neutron activation of molybdenum, which quickly

ββ  decays into

99mTc99mTc. Technetium-99m can be attached to many compounds to allow the imaging of the skeleton, heart, lungs, kidneys, etc. 99mTc99mTc 99mTc99mTc γγ 99mTc99mTc ββ 99mTc99mTc Figure 32.3 shows one of the simpler methods of imaging the concentration of nuclear activity, employing a device called an Anger camera or gamma camera. A piece of lead with holes bored through it collimates γγ rays emerging from the patient, allowing detectors to receive γγ rays from specific directions only. The computer analysis of detector signals produces an image. One of the disadvantages of this detection method is that there is no depth information (i.e., it provides a two-dimensional view of the tumor as opposed to a three-dimensional view), because radiation from any location under that detector produces a signal. Anger camera gamma camera γγ γγ Figure 32.3 An Anger or gamma camera consists of a lead collimator and an array of detectors. Gamma rays produce light flashes in the scintillators. The light output is converted to an electrical signal by the photomultipliers. A computer constructs an image from the detector output. Imaging techniques much like those in x-ray computed tomography (CT) scans use nuclear activity in patients to form three-dimensional images. Figure 32.4 shows a patient in a circular array of detectors that may be stationary or rotated, with detector output used by a computer to construct a detailed image. This technique is called single-photon-emission computed tomography(SPECT) or sometimes simply SPET. The spatial resolution of this technique is poor, about 1 cm, but the contrast (i.e. the difference in visual properties that makes an object distinguishable from other objects and the background) is good. single-photon-emission computed tomography(SPECT) Figure 32.4 SPECT uses a geometry similar to a CT scanner to form an image of the concentration of a radiopharmaceutical compound. (credit: Woldo, Wikimedia Commons) Images produced by
β+β+ emitters have become important in recent years. When the emitted positron (
β+β+) encounters an electron, mutual annihilation occurs, producing two γγ rays. These γγ rays have identical 0.511-MeV energies (the energy comes from the destruction of an electron or positron mass) and they move directly away from one another, allowing detectors to determine their point of origin accurately, as shown in Figure 32.5. The system is called positron emission tomography (PET). It requires detectors on opposite sides to simultaneously (i.e., at the same time) detect photons of 0.511-MeV energy and utilizes computer imaging techniques similar to those in SPECT and CT scans. Examples of
β+β+ -emitting isotopes used in PET are

11C11C,

13N13N,

15O15O, and

18F18F, as seen in Table 32.1. This list includes C, N, and O, and so they have the advantage of being able to function as tags for natural body compounds. Its resolution of 0.5 cm is better than that of SPECT; the accuracy and sensitivity of PET scans make them useful for examining the brain’s anatomy and function. The brain’s use of oxygen and water can be monitored with
15O15O. PET is used extensively for diagnosing brain disorders. It can note decreased metabolism in certain regions prior to a confirmation of Alzheimer’s disease. PET can locate regions in the brain that become active when a person carries out specific activities, such as speaking, closing their eyes, and so on. β+β+ β+β+ γγ γγ positron emission tomography (PET) β+β+ 11C11C 13N13N 15O15O 18F18F 15O15O Figure 32.5 A PET system takes advantage of the two identical γγ-ray photons produced by positron-electron annihilation. These γγ rays are emitted in opposite directions, so that the line along which each pair is emitted is determined. Various events detected by several pairs of detectors are then analyzed by the computer to form an accurate image."

Page 381,“Activity” refers to the radioactive source while “dose” refers to the amount of energy from the radiation that is deposited in a person or object.
Page 381,"Laws regulate radiation doses to which people can be exposed. The greatest occupational whole-body dose that is allowed depends upon the country and is about 20 to 50 mSv/y and is rarely reached by medical and nuclear power workers. Higher doses are allowed for the hands. Much lower doses are permitted for the reproductive organs and the fetuses of pregnant women. Inadvertent doses to the public are limited to 1/101/10 of occupational doses, except for those caused by nuclear power, which cannot legally expose the public to more than 1/10001/1000 of the occupational limit or 0.05 mSv/y (5 mrem/y). This has been exceeded in the United States only at the time of the Three Mile Island (TMI) accident in 1979. Chernobyl is another story. Extensive monitoring with a variety of radiation detectors is performed to assure radiation safety. Increased ventilation in uranium mines has lowered the dose there to about 1 mSv/y. 1/101/10 1/10001/1000 Table 32.5 Background Radiation Sources and Average Doses To physically limit radiation doses, we use shielding, increase the distance from a source, and limit the time of exposure. shielding Figure 32.7 illustrates how these are used to protect both the patient and the dental technician when an x-ray is taken. Shielding absorbs radiation and can be provided by any material, including sufficient air. The greater the distance from the source, the more the radiation spreads out. The less time a person is exposed to a given source, the smaller is the dose received by the person. Doses from most medical diagnostics have decreased in recent years due to faster films that require less exposure time. Figure 32.7 A lead apron is placed over the dental patient and shielding surrounds the x-ray tube to limit exposure to tissue other than the tissue that is being imaged. Fast films limit the time needed to obtain images, reducing exposure to the imaged tissue. The technician stands a few meters away behind a lead-lined door with a lead glass window, reducing her occupational exposure. Table 32.6 Typical Doses Received During Diagnostic X-ray Exams"
Page 381,"You need to follow certain steps for dose calculations, which are Step 1. Examine the situation to determine that a person is exposed to ionizing radiation. Step 2. Identify exactly what needs to be determined in the problem (identify the unknowns). The most straightforward problems ask for a dose calculation. Step 3. Make a list of what is given or can be inferred from the problem as stated (identify the knowns). Look for information on the type of radiation, the energy per event, the activity, and the mass of tissue affected. Step 4. For dose calculations, you need to determine the energy deposited. This may take one or more steps, depending on the given information. Step 5. Divide the deposited energy by the mass of the affected tissue. Use units of joules for energy and kilograms for mass. To calculate the dose in Gy, use the definition that 1 Gy = 1 J/kg. Step 6. To calculate the dose in mSv, determine the RBE (QF) of the radiation. Recall that 1 mSv=1 mGy×RBE(or1 rem=1 rad×RBE)1 mSv=1 mGy×RBE(or1 rem=1 rad×RBE). 1 mSv=1 mGy×RBE(or1 rem=1 rad×RBE)1 mSv=1 mGy×RBE(or1 rem=1 rad×RBE) Step 7. Check the answer to see if it is reasonable: Does it make sense? The dose should be consistent with the numbers given in the text for diagnostic, occupational, and therapeutic exposures. Example 32.1 Calculate the dose in rem/y for the lungs of a weapons plant employee who inhales and retains an activity of 1.00 μCi of 239Pu1.00 μCi of 239Pu in an accident. The mass of affected lung tissue is 2.00 kg, the plutonium decays by emission of a 5.23-MeV αα particle, and you may assume the higher value of the RBE for αα s from Table 32.2. 1.00 μCi of 239Pu1.00 μCi of 239Pu αα αα Dose in rem is defined by 1 rad=0.01 J/kg1 rad=0.01 J/kg and rem=rad×RBErem=rad×RBE. The energy deposited is divided by the mass of tissue affected and then multiplied by the RBE. The latter two quantities are given, and so the main task in this example will be to find the energy deposited in one year. Since the activity of the source is given, we can calculate the number of decays, multiply by the energy per decay, and convert MeV to joules to get the total energy. 1 rad=0.01 J/kg1 rad=0.01 J/kg rem=rad×RBErem=rad×RBE The activity R=1.00μCi = 3.70×104Bq=3.70×104R=1.00μCi = 3.70×104Bq=3.70×104 decays/s. So, the number of decays per year is obtained by multiplying by the number of seconds in a year: R=1.00μCi = 3.70×104Bq=3.70×104R=1.00μCi = 3.70×104Bq=3.70×104 32.7 Thus, the ionizing energy deposited per year is 32.8 Dividing by the mass of the affected tissue gives 32.9 One Gray is 1.00 J/kg, and so the dose in Gy is 32.10 Now, the dose in Sv is 32.11 32.12 First note that the dose is given to two digits, because the RBE is (at best) known only to two digits. By any standard, this yearly radiation dose is high and will have a devastating effect on the health of the worker. Worse yet, plutonium has a long radioactive half-life and is not readily eliminated by the body, and so it will remain in the lungs. Being an αα emitter makes the effects 10 to 20 times worse than the same ionization produced by ββ s, γγ rays, or x-rays. An activity of 1.00μCi1.00μCi is created by only 16μg16μg of 239Pu239Pu (left as an end-of-chapter problem to verify), partly justifying claims that plutonium is the most toxic substance known.

Page 381,"Medical doses of radiation are also limited. Diagnostic doses are generally low and have further lowered with improved techniques and faster films. With the possible exception of routine dental x-rays, radiation is used diagnostically only when needed so that the low risk is justified by the benefit of the diagnosis. Chest x-rays give the lowest doses—about 0.1 mSv to the tissue affected, with less than 5 percent scattering into tissues that are not directly imaged. Other x-ray procedures range upward to about 10 mSv in a CT scan, and about 5 mSv (0.5 rem) per dental x-ray, again both only affecting the tissue imaged. Medical images with radiopharmaceuticals give doses ranging from 1 to 5 mSv, usually localized. One exception is the thyroid scan using 131I131I. Because of its relatively long half-life, it exposes the thyroid to about 0.75 Sv. The isotope 123I123I is more difficult to produce, but its short half-life limits thyroid exposure to about 15 mSv. 131I131I 123I123I"

Page 382,"The earliest uses of ionizing radiation on humans were mostly harmful, with many at the level of snake oil as seen in Figure 32.8. Radium-doped cosmetics that glowed in the dark were used around the time of World War I. As recently as the 1950s, radon mine tours were promoted as healthful and rejuvenating—those who toured were exposed but gained no benefits. Radium salts were sold as health elixirs for many years. The gruesome death of a wealthy industrialist, who became psychologically addicted to the brew, alerted the unsuspecting to the dangers of radium salt elixirs. Most abuses finally ended after the legislation in the 1950s. Figure 32.8 The properties of radiation were once touted for far more than its modern use in cancer therapy. Until 1932, radium was advertised for a variety of uses, often with tragic results. (credit: Struthious Bandersnatch.) Radiotherapy is effective against cancer because cancer cells reproduce rapidly and, consequently, are more sensitive to radiation. The central problem in radiotherapy is to make the dose for cancer cells as high as possible while limiting the dose for normal cells. The ratio of abnormal cells killed to normal cells killed is called the therapeutic ratio, and all radiotherapy techniques are designed to enhance this ratio. Radiation can be concentrated in cancerous tissue by a number of techniques. One of the most prevalent techniques for well-defined tumors is a geometric technique shown in Figure 32.9. A narrow beam of radiation is passed through the patient from a variety of directions with a common crossing point in the tumor. This concentrates the dose in the tumor while spreading it out over a large volume of normal tissue. The external radiation can be x-rays, 60Co γ60Co γ rays, or ionizing-particle beams produced by accelerators. Accelerator-produced beams of neutrons, π-mesonsπ-mesons, and heavy ions such as nitrogen nuclei have been employed, and these can be quite effective. These particles have larger QFs or RBEs and sometimes can be better localized, producing a greater therapeutic ratio. But accelerator radiotherapy is much more expensive and less frequently employed than other forms. therapeutic ratio 60Co γ60Co γ π-mesonsπ-mesons Figure 32.9 The 60Co60Co source of γγ-radiation is rotated around the patient so that the common crossing point is in the tumor, concentrating the dose there. This geometric technique works for well-defined tumors. Another form of radiotherapy uses chemically inert radioactive implants. One use is for prostate cancer. Radioactive seeds (about 40 to 100 and the size of a grain of rice) are placed in the prostate region. The isotopes used are usually 135I135I (6-month half life) or 103Pd103Pd (3-month half life). Alpha emitters have the dual advantages of a large QF and a small range for better localization. 135I135I 103Pd103Pd Radiopharmaceuticals are used for cancer therapy when they can be localized well enough to produce a favorable therapeutic ratio. Thyroid cancer is commonly treated utilizing radioactive iodine. Thyroid cells concentrate iodine, and cancerous thyroid cells are more aggressive in doing this. An ingenious use of radiopharmaceuticals in cancer therapy tags antibodies with radioisotopes. Antibodies produced by a patient to combat his cancer are extracted, cultured, loaded with a radioisotope, and then returned to the patient. The antibodies are concentrated almost entirely in the tissue they developed to fight, thus localizing the radiation in abnormal tissue. The therapeutic ratio can be quite high for short-range radiation. There is, however, a significant dose for organs that eliminate radiopharmaceuticals from the body, such as the liver, kidneys, and bladder. As with most radiotherapy, the technique is limited by the tolerable amount of damage to the normal tissue. Table 32.7 lists typical therapeutic doses of radiation used against certain cancers. The doses are large, but not fatal because they are localized and spread out in time. Protocols for treatment vary with the type of cancer and the condition and response of the patient. Three to five 200-rem treatments per week for a period of several weeks is typical. Time between treatments allows the body to repair normal tissue. This effect occurs because damage is concentrated in the abnormal tissue, and the abnormal tissue is more sensitive to radiation. Damage to normal tissue limits the doses. You will note that the greatest doses are given to any tissue that is not rapidly reproducing, such as in the adult brain. Lung cancer, on the other end of the scale, cannot ordinarily be cured with radiation because of the sensitivity of lung tissue and blood to radiation. But radiotherapy for lung cancer does alleviate symptoms and prolong life and is therefore justified in some cases. Table 32.7 Cancer Radiotherapy Finally, it is interesting to note that chemotherapy employs drugs that interfere with cell division and is, thus, also effective against cancer. It also has almost the same side effects, such as nausea and hair loss, and risks, such as the inducement of another cancer."

Page 384,"(a) Calculate the energy released by the fusion of a 1.00-kg mixture of deuterium and tritium, which produces helium. There are equal numbers of deuterium and tritium nuclei in the mixture. (b) If this takes place continuously over a period of a year, what is the average power output? According to 2H+3H→4He +n2H+3H→4He +n, the energy per reaction is 17.59 MeV. To find the total energy released, we must find the number of deuterium and tritium atoms in a kilogram. Deuterium has an atomic mass of about 2 and tritium has an atomic mass of about 3, for a total of about 5 g per mole of reactants or about 200 mol in 1.00 kg. To get a more precise figure, we will use the atomic masses from Appendix A. The power output is best expressed in watts, and so the energy output needs to be calculated in joules and then divided by the number of seconds in a year. 2H+3H→4He +n2H+3H→4He +n The atomic mass of deuterium (2H2H) is 2.014102 u, while that of tritium (3H3H) is 3.016049 u, for a total of 5.032151 u per reaction. So a mole of reactants has a mass of 5.03 g, and in 1.00 kg there are

(1000 g)/(5.03 g/mol)=198.8 mol of reactants(1000 g)/(5.03 g/mol)=198.8 mol of reactants. The number of reactions that take place is therefore 2H2H 3H3H (1000 g)/(5.03 g/mol)=198.8 mol of reactants(1000 g)/(5.03 g/mol)=198.8 mol of reactants 32.23 The total energy output is the number of reactions times the energy per reaction: 32.24 Power is energy per unit time. One year has 3.16×107s3.16×107s, so 3.16×107s3.16×107s 32.25 By now we expect nuclear processes to yield large amounts of energy, and we are not disappointed here. The energy output of 3.37×1014J3.37×1014J from fusing 1.00 kg of deuterium and tritium is equivalent to 2.6 million gallons of gasoline and about eight times the energy output of the bomb that destroyed Hiroshima. Yet the average backyard swimming pool has about 6 kg of deuterium in it, so that fuel is plentiful if it can be utilized in a controlled manner. The average power output over a year is more than 10 MW, impressive but a bit small for a commercial power plant. About 32 times this power output would allow generation of 100 MW of electricity, assuming an efficiency of one-third in converting the fusion energy to electrical energy. 3.37×1014J3.37×1014J"

Page 392,"Taking the range of the strong nuclear force to be about 1 fermi (10−15m10−15m), calculate the approximate mass of the pion carrying the force, assuming it moves at nearly the speed of light. 10−15m10−15m The calculation is approximate because of the assumptions made about the range of the force and the speed of the pion, but also because a more accurate calculation would require the sophisticated mathematics of quantum mechanics. Here, we use the Heisenberg uncertainty principle in the simple form stated above, as developed in Probability: The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. First, we must calculate the time ΔtΔt that the pion exists, given that the distance it travels at nearly the speed of light is about 1 fermi. Then, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle can be solved for the energy ΔEΔE, and from that the mass of the pion can be determined. We will use the units of MeV/c2MeV/c2 for mass, which are convenient since we are often considering converting mass to energy and vice versa. ΔtΔt ΔEΔE MeV/c2MeV/c2 The distance the pion travels is d≈cΔtd≈cΔt, and so the time during which it exists is approximately d≈cΔtd≈cΔt 33.2 Now, solving the Heisenberg uncertainty principle for ΔEΔE gives ΔEΔE 33.3 Solving this and converting the energy to MeV gives 33.4 Mass is related to energy by ΔE=mc2ΔE=mc2, so that the mass of the pion is m=ΔE/c2m=ΔE/c2, or ΔE=mc2ΔE=mc2 m=ΔE/c2m=ΔE/c2 33.5 This is about 200 times the mass of an electron and about one-tenth the mass of a nucleon.

Page 394,"An early accelerator is a relatively simple, large-scale version of the electron gun. The Van de Graaff (named after the Dutch physicist), which you have likely seen in physics demonstrations, is a small version of the ones used for nuclear research since their invention for that purpose in 1932. For more, see Figure 33.7. These machines are electrostatic, creating potentials as great as 50 MV, and are used to accelerate a variety of nuclei for a range of experiments. Energies produced by Van de Graaffs are insufficient to produce new particles, but they have been instrumental in exploring several aspects of the nucleus. Another, equally famous, early accelerator is the cyclotron, invented in 1930 by the American physicist, E. O. Lawrence (1901–1958). For a visual representation with more detail, see Figure 33.8. Cyclotrons use fixed-frequency alternating electric fields to accelerate particles. The particles spiral outward in a magnetic field, making increasingly larger radius orbits during acceleration. This clever arrangement allows the successive addition of electric potential energy and so greater particle energies are possible than in a Van de Graaff. Lawrence was involved in many early discoveries and in the promotion of physics programs in American universities. He was awarded the 1939 Nobel Prize in Physics for the cyclotron and nuclear activations, and he has an element and two major laboratories named for him. Van de Graaff cyclotron A synchrotron is a version of a cyclotron in which the frequency of the alternating voltage and the magnetic field strength are increased as the beam particles are accelerated. Particles are made to travel the same distance in a shorter time with each cycle in fixed-radius orbits. A ring of magnets and accelerating tubes, as shown in Figure 33.9, are the major components of synchrotrons. Accelerating voltages are synchronized (i.e., occur at the same time) with the particles to accelerate them, hence the name. Magnetic field strength is increased to keep the orbital radius constant as energy increases. High-energy particles require strong magnetic fields to steer them, so superconducting magnets are commonly employed. Still limited by achievable magnetic field strengths, synchrotrons need to be very large at very high energies, since the radius of a high-energy particle’s orbit is very large. Radiation caused by a magnetic field accelerating a charged particle perpendicular to its velocity is called synchrotron radiation in honor of its importance in these machines. Synchrotron radiation has a characteristic spectrum and polarization, and can be recognized in cosmic rays, implying large-scale magnetic fields acting on energetic and charged particles in deep space. Synchrotron radiation produced by accelerators is sometimes used as a source of intense energetic electromagnetic radiation for research purposes. synchrotron synchrotron radiation Figure 33.7 An artist’s rendition of a Van de Graaff generator. Figure 33.8 Cyclotrons use a magnetic field to cause particles to move in circular orbits. As the particles pass between the plates of the Ds, the voltage across the gap is oscillated to accelerate them twice in each orbit."
Page 394,"Physicists have built ever-larger machines, first to reduce the wavelength of the probe and obtain greater detail, then to put greater energy into collisions to create new particles. Each major energy increase brought new information, sometimes producing spectacular progress, motivating the next step. One major innovation was driven by the desire to create more massive particles. Since momentum needs to be conserved in a collision, the particles created by a beam hitting a stationary target should recoil. This means that part of the energy input goes into recoil kinetic energy, significantly limiting the fraction of the beam energy that can be converted into new particles. One solution to this problem is to have head-on collisions between particles moving in opposite directions. Colliding beams are made to meet head-on at points where massive detectors are located. Since the total incoming momentum is zero, it is possible to create particles with momenta and kinetic energies near zero. Particles with masses equivalent to twice the beam energy can thus be created. Another innovation is to create the antimatter counterpart of the beam particle, which thus has the opposite charge and circulates in the opposite direction in the same beam pipe. For a schematic representation, see Figure 33.10. Colliding beams Figure 33.9 (a) A synchrotron has a ring of magnets and accelerating tubes. The frequency of the accelerating voltages is increased to cause the beam particles to travel the same distance in shorter time. The magnetic field should also be increased to keep each beam burst traveling in a fixed-radius path. Limits on magnetic field strength require these machines to be very large in order to accelerate particles to very high energies. (b) A positive particle is shown in the gap between accelerating tubes. (c) While the particle passes through the tube, the potentials are reversed so that there is another acceleration at the next gap. The frequency of the reversals needs to be varied as the particle is accelerated to achieve successive accelerations in each gap. Figure 33.10 This schematic shows the two rings of Fermilab’s accelerator and the scheme for colliding protons and antiprotons (not to scale). Detectors capable of finding the new particles in the spray of material that emerges from colliding beams are as impressive as the accelerators. While the Fermilab Tevatron had proton and antiproton beam energies of about 1 TeV, so that it can create particles up to 2 TeV/c22 TeV/c2, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at the European Center for Nuclear Research (CERN) has achieved beam energies of 3.5 TeV, so that it has a 7-TeV collision energy; CERN hopes to double the beam energy in 2014. The now-canceled Superconducting Super Collider was being constructed in Texas with a design energy of 20 TeV to give a 40-TeV collision energy. It was to be an oval 30 km in diameter. Its cost as well as the politics of international research funding led to its demise. 2 TeV/c22 TeV/c2 In addition to the large synchrotrons that produce colliding beams of protons and antiprotons, there are other large electron-positron accelerators. The oldest of these was a straight-line or linear accelerator, called the Stanford Linear Accelerator (SLAC), which accelerated particles up to 50 GeV as seen in Figure 33.11. Positrons created by the accelerator were brought to the same energy and collided with electrons in specially designed detectors. Linear accelerators use accelerating tubes similar to those in synchrotrons, but aligned in a straight line. This helps eliminate synchrotron radiation losses, which are particularly severe for electrons made to follow curved paths. CERN had an electron-positron collider appropriately called the Large Electron-Positron Collider (LEP), which accelerated particles to 100 GeV and created a collision energy of 200 GeV. It was 8.5 km in diameter, while the SLAC machine was 3.2 km long. linear accelerator Figure 33.11 The Stanford Linear Accelerator was 3.2 km long and had the capability of colliding electron and positron beams. SLAC was also used to probe nucleons by scattering extremely short wavelength electrons from them. This produced the first convincing evidence of a quark structure inside nucleons in an experiment analogous to those performed by Rutherford long ago. Example 33.2 A linear accelerator designed to produce a beam of 800-MeV protons has 2000 accelerating tubes. What average voltage must be applied between tubes (such as in the gaps in Figure 33.9) to achieve the desired energy?

Page 395,"The positron was only the first example of antimatter. Every particle in nature has an antimatter counterpart, although some particles, like the photon, are their own antiparticles. Antimatter has charge opposite to that of matter (for example, the positron is positive while the electron is negative) but is nearly identical otherwise, having the same mass, intrinsic spin, half-life, and so on. When a particle and its antimatter counterpart interact, they annihilate one another, usually totally converting their masses to pure energy in the form of photons as seen in Figure 33.13. Neutral particles, such as neutrons, have neutral antimatter counterparts, which also annihilate when they interact. Certain neutral particles are their own antiparticle and live correspondingly short lives. For example, the neutral pion π0π0 is its own antiparticle and has a half-life about 10−810−8 shorter than π+π+ and π−π−, which are each other’s antiparticles. Without exception, nature is symmetric—all particles have antimatter counterparts. For example, antiprotons and antineutrons were first created in accelerator experiments in 1956 and the antiproton is negative. Antihydrogen atoms, consisting of an antiproton and antielectron, were observed in 1995 at CERN, too. It is possible to contain large-scale antimatter particles such as antiprotons by using electromagnetic traps that confine the particles within a magnetic field so that they don't annihilate with other particles. However, particles of the same charge repel each other, so the more particles that are contained in a trap, the more energy is needed to power the magnetic field that contains them. It is not currently possible to store a significant quantity of antiprotons. At any rate, we now see that negative charge is associated with both low-mass (electrons) and high-mass particles (antiprotons) and the apparent asymmetry is not there. But this knowledge does raise another question—why is there such a predominance of matter and so little antimatter? Possible explanations emerge later in this and the next chapter. π0π0 10−810−8 π+π+ π−π−"
Page 395,"Particles can also be revealingly grouped according to what forces they feel between them. All particles (even those that are massless) are affected by gravity, since gravity affects the space and time in which particles exist. All charged particles are affected by the electromagnetic force, as are neutral particles that have an internal distribution of charge (such as the neutron with its magnetic moment). Special names are given to particles that feel the strong and weak nuclear forces. Hadrons are particles that feel the strong nuclear force, whereas leptons are particles that do not. The proton, neutron, and the pions are examples of hadrons. The electron, positron, muons, and neutrinos are examples of leptons, the name meaning low mass. Leptons feel the weak nuclear force. In fact, all particles feel the weak nuclear force. This means that hadrons are distinguished by being able to feel both the strong and weak nuclear forces. Hadrons leptons Table 33.2 lists the characteristics of some of the most important subatomic particles, including the directly observed carrier particles for the electromagnetic and weak nuclear forces, all leptons, and some hadrons. Several hints related to an underlying substructure emerge from an examination of these particle characteristics. Note that the carrier particles are called gauge bosons. First mentioned in Patterns in Spectra Reveal More Quantization, a boson is a particle with zero or an integer value of intrinsic spin (such as s=0, 1, 2, ...s=0, 1, 2, ...), whereas a fermion is a particle with a half-integer value of intrinsic spin (s=1/2,3/2,...s=1/2,3/2,...). Fermions obey the Pauli exclusion principle whereas bosons do not. All the known and conjectured carrier particles are bosons. gauge bosons boson s=0, 1, 2, ...s=0, 1, 2, ... fermion s=1/2,3/2,...s=1/2,3/2,... Figure 33.13 When a particle encounters its antiparticle, they annihilate, often producing pure energy in the form of photons. In this case, an electron and a positron convert all their mass into two identical energy rays, which move away in opposite directions to keep total momentum zero as it was before. Similar annihilations occur for other combinations of a particle with its antiparticle, sometimes producing more particles while obeying all conservation laws. Table 33.2 Selected Particle Characteristics7 All known leptons are listed in the table given above. There are only six leptons (and their antiparticles), and they seem to be fundamental in that they have no apparent underlying structure. Leptons have no discernible size other than their wavelength, so that we know they are pointlike down to about 10−18m10−18m. The leptons fall into three families, implying three conservation laws for three quantum numbers. One of these was known from ββ decay, where the existence of the electron’s neutrino implied that a new quantum number, called the electron family number LeLe is conserved. Thus, in ββ decay, an antielectron’s neutrino v-ev-e must be created with Le=−1Le=−1 when an electron with Le=+1Le=+1 is created, so that the total remains 0 as it was before decay. 10−18m10−18m ββ electron family number LeLe ββ v-ev-e Le=−1Le=−1 Le=+1Le=+1 Once the muon was discovered in cosmic rays, its decay mode was found to be 33.7 which implied another “family” and associated conservation principle. The particle vμvμ is a muon’s neutrino, and it is created to conserve muon family numberLμLμ. So muons are leptons with a family of their own, and conservation of total LμLμ also seems to be obeyed  in many experiments. vμvμ muon family number LμLμ conservation of total LμLμ LμLμ More recently, a third lepton family was discovered when ττ particles were created and observed to decay in a manner similar to muons. One principal decay mode is ττ 33.8 Conservation of total   LτLτ seems to be another law obeyed in many experiments. In fact, particle experiments have found that lepton family number is not universally conserved, due to neutrino “oscillations,” or transformations of neutrinos from one family type to another. Conservation of total LτLτ"
Page 395,"Now, note that the hadrons in the table given above are divided into two subgroups, called mesons (originally for medium mass) and baryons (the name originally meaning large mass). The division between mesons and baryons is actually based on their observed decay modes and is not strictly associated with their masses. Mesons are hadrons that can decay to leptons and leave no hadrons, which implies that mesons are not conserved in number. Baryons are hadrons that always decay to another baryon. A new physical quantity called baryon number BB seems to always be conserved in nature and is listed for the various particles in the table given above. Mesons and leptons have B=0B=0 so that they can decay to other particles with B=0B=0. But baryons have B=+1B=+1 if they are matter, and B=−1B=−1 if they are antimatter. The conservation of total baryon number is a more general rule than first noted in nuclear physics, where it was observed that the total number of nucleons was always conserved in nuclear reactions and decays. That rule in nuclear physics is just one consequence of the conservation of the total baryon number. Mesons Baryons baryon number BB B=0B=0 B=0B=0 B=+1B=+1 B=−1B=−1 conservation of total baryon number"
Page 395,"The forces that act between particles regulate how they interact with other particles. For example, pions feel the strong force and do not penetrate as far in matter as do muons, which do not feel the strong force. (This was the way those who discovered the muon knew it could not be the particle that carries the strong force—its penetration or range was too great for it to be feeling the strong force.) Similarly, reactions that create other particles, like cosmic rays interacting with nuclei in the atmosphere, have greater probability if they are caused by the strong force than if they are caused by the weak force. Such knowledge has been useful to physicists while analyzing the particles produced by various accelerators. The forces experienced by particles also govern how particles interact with themselves if they are unstable and decay. For example, the stronger the force, the faster they decay and the shorter is their lifetime. An example of a nuclear decay via the strong force is

Be→α+α with a lifetime of about 10−16s10−16s. The neutron is a good example of decay via the weak force. The process n→p+e−+v-en→p+e−+v-e has a longer lifetime of 882 s. The weak force causes this decay, as it does all ββ decay. An important clue that the weak force is responsible for ββ decay is the creation of leptons, such as e−e− and v-ev-e. None would be created if the strong force was responsible, just as no leptons are created in the decay of 8Be8Be. The systematics of particle lifetimes is a little simpler than nuclear lifetimes when hundreds of particles are examined (not just the ones in the table given above). Particles that decay via the weak force have lifetimes mostly in the range of 10−1610−16 to 10−1210−12 s, whereas those that decay via the strong force have lifetimes mostly in the range of 10−1610−16 to 10−2310−23 s. Turning this around, if we measure the lifetime of a particle, we can tell if it decays via the weak or strong force. 8

Note that the particles Λ,Σ,ΞΛ,Σ,Ξ, and ΩΩ decay with lifetimes on the order of 10−1010−10 s (the exception is Σ0Σ0, whose short lifetime is explained by its particular quark substructure.), implying that their decay is caused by the weak force alone, although they are hadrons and feel the strong force. The decay modes of these particles also show patterns—in particular, certain decays that should be possible within all the known conservation laws do not occur. Whenever something is possible in physics, it will happen. If something does not happen, it is forbidden by a rule. All this seemed strange to those studying these particles when they were first discovered, so they named a new quantum number strangeness, given the symbol SS in the table given above. The values of strangeness assigned to various particles are based on the decay systematics. It is found that strangeness is conserved by the strong force, which governs the production of most of these particles in accelerator experiments. However, strangeness is not conserved by the weak force. This conclusion is reached from the fact that particles that have long lifetimes decay via the weak force and do not conserve strangeness. All of this also has implications for the carrier particles, since they transmit forces and are thus involved in these decays. Λ,Σ,ΞΛ,Σ,Ξ ΩΩ 10−1010−10 Σ0Σ0 strangeness SS Example 33.3 (a) The most common decay mode of the Ξ−Ξ− particle is Ξ−→Λ0+π−Ξ−→Λ0+π−.

Ξ−Ξ− Ξ−→Λ0+π−Ξ−→Λ0+π− (b) Is the decay K+→μ++νμK+→μ++νμ allowed, given the quantum numbers in the table given above? K+→μ++νμK+→μ++νμ In part (a), the conservation laws can be examined by adding the quantum numbers of the decay products and comparing them with the parent particle. In part (b), the same procedure can reveal if a conservation law is broken or not. Before the decay, the Ξ−Ξ− has strangeness S=−2S=−2. After the decay, the total strangeness is –1 for the Λ0Λ0, plus 0 for the π−π−. Thus, total strangeness has gone from –2 to –1 or a change of +1. Baryon number for the Ξ−Ξ− is B=+1B=+1 before the decay, and after the decay the Λ0Λ0 has B=+1B=+1 and the π−π− has B=0B=0 so that the total baryon number remains +1. Charge is –1 before the decay, and the total charge after is also 0−1=−10−1=−1. Lepton numbers for all the particles are zero, and so lepton numbers are conserved.

Ξ−Ξ− 1.64×10−10-s1.64×10−10-s Ξ−Ξ− The decay K+→μ++νμK+→μ++νμ is allowed if charge, baryon number, mass-energy, and lepton numbers are conserved. Strangeness can change due to the weak interaction. Charge is conserved as s→ds→d. Baryon number is conserved, since all particles have B=0B=0.  Mass-energy is conserved in the sense that the K+K+ has a greater mass than the products, so that the decay can be spontaneous. Lepton family numbers are conserved at 0 for the electron and tau family for all particles. The muon family number is Lμ=0Lμ=0 before and Lμ=−1+1=0Lμ=−1+1=0 after. Strangeness changes from +1 before to 0 + 0 after, for an allowed change of 1. The decay is allowed by all these measures.

K+K+ 1.24×10−8-s1.24×10−8-s There are hundreds of particles, all hadrons, not listed in Table 33.2, most of which have shorter lifetimes. The systematics of those particle lifetimes, their production probabilities, and decay products are completely consistent with the conservation laws noted for lepton families, baryon number, and strangeness, but they also imply other quantum numbers and conservation laws. There are a finite, and in fact relatively small, number of these conserved quantities, however, implying a finite set of substructures. Additionally, some of these short-lived particles resemble the excited states of other particles, implying an internal structure. All of this jigsaw puzzle can be tied together and explained relatively simply by the existence of fundamental substructures. Leptons seem to be fundamental structures. Hadrons seem to have a substructure called quarks. Quarks: Is That All There Is?  explores the basics of the underlying quark building blocks. Figure 33.14 Murray Gell-Mann (b. 1929) proposed quarks as a substructure of hadrons in 1963 and was already known for his work on the concept of strangeness. Although quarks have never been directly observed, several predictions of the quark model were quickly confirmed, and their properties explain all known hadron characteristics. Gell-Mann was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1969. (credit: Luboš Motl)"

Page 396,"Quarks were first proposed independently by American physicists Murray Gell-Mann and George Zweig in 1963. Their quaint name was taken by Gell-Mann from a James Joyce novel—Gell-Mann was also largely responsible for the concept and name of strangeness. (Whimsical names are common in particle physics, reflecting the personalities of modern physicists.) Originally, three quark types—or flavors—were proposed to account for the then-known mesons and baryons. These quark flavors are named up (u), down (d), and strange (s). All quarks have half-integral spin and are thus fermions. All mesons have integral spin while all baryons have half-integral spin. Therefore, mesons should be made up of an even number of quarks while baryons need to be made up of an odd number of quarks. Figure 33.15 shows the quark substructure of the proton, neutron, and two pions. The most radical proposal by Gell-Mann and Zweig is the fractional charges of quarks, which are ±23qe±23qe and 13qe13qe, whereas all directly observed particles have charges that are integral multiples of qeqe. Note that the fractional value of the quark does not violate the fact that the e is the smallest unit of charge that is observed, because a free quark cannot exist. Table 33.3 lists characteristics of the six quark flavors that are now thought to exist. Discoveries made since 1963 have required extra quark flavors, which are divided into three families quite analogous to leptons. flavors up down strange ±23qe±23qe 13qe13qe qeqe"
Page 396,"To understand how these quark substructures work, let us specifically examine the proton, neutron, and the two pions pictured in Figure 33.15 before moving on to more general considerations. First, the proton p is composed of the three quarks uud, so that its total charge is +23qe+23qe−13qe=qe+23qe+23qe−13qe=qe, as expected. With the spins aligned as in the figure, the proton’s intrinsic spin is +12+12−12=12+12+12−12=12, also as expected. Note that the spins of the up quarks are aligned, so that they would be in the same state except that they have different colors (another quantum number to be elaborated upon a little later). Quarks obey the Pauli exclusion principle. Similar comments apply to the neutron n, which is composed of the three quarks udd. Note also that the neutron is made of charges that add to zero but move internally, producing its well-known magnetic moment. When the neutron β−β− decays, it does so by changing the flavor of one of its quarks. Writing neutron β−β− decay in terms of quarks, +23qe+23qe−13qe=qe+23qe+23qe−13qe=qe +12+12−12=12+12+12−12=12 β−β− β−β− 33.9 We see that this is equivalent to a down quark changing flavor to become an up quark: 33.10 Table 33.3 Quarks and Antiquarks10 Table 33.4 Quark Composition of Selected Hadrons15 This is an example of the general fact that the weak nuclear force can change the flavor of a quark. By general, we mean that any quark can be converted to any other (change flavor) by the weak nuclear force. Not only can we get d→ud→u, we can also get u→du→d. Furthermore, the strange quark can be changed by the weak force, too, making s→us→u and s→ds→d possible. This explains the violation of the conservation of strangeness by the weak force noted in the preceding section. Another general fact is that the strong nuclear force cannot change the flavor of a quark. d→ud→u u→du→d s→us→u s→ds→d Again, from Figure 33.15, we see that the π+π+ meson (one of the three pions) is composed of an up quark plus an antidown quark, or ud-ud-. Its total charge is thus +23qe+13qe=qe+23qe+13qe=qe, as expected. Its baryon number is 0, since it has a quark and an antiquark with baryon numbers +13−13=0+13−13=0. The π+π+ half-life is relatively long since, although it is composed of matter and antimatter, the quarks are different flavors and the weak force should cause the decay by changing the flavor of one into that of the other. The spins of the uu and d-d- quarks are antiparallel, enabling the pion to have spin zero, as observed experimentally. Finally, the π−π− meson shown in Figure 33.15 is the antiparticle of the π+π+ meson, and it is composed of the corresponding quark antiparticles. That is, the π+π+ meson is ud-ud-, while the π−π− meson is u-du-d. These two pions annihilate each other quickly, because their constituent quarks are each other’s antiparticles. π+π+ ud-ud- +23qe+13qe=qe+23qe+13qe=qe +13−13=0+13−13=0 π+π+ uu d-d- π−π− π+π+ π+π+ ud-ud- π−π− u-du-d Two general rules for combining quarks to form hadrons are: One of the clever things about this scheme is that only integral charges result, even though the quarks have fractional charge."
Page 396,"All quark combinations are possible. Table 33.4 lists some of these combinations. When Gell-Mann and Zweig proposed the original three quark flavors, particles corresponding to all combinations of those three had not been observed. The pattern was there, but it was incomplete—much as had been the case in the periodic table of the elements and the chart of nuclides. The Ω−Ω− particle, in particular, had not been discovered but was predicted by quark theory. Its combination of three strange quarks, ssssss, gives it a strangeness of −3−3 (see Table 33.2) and other predictable characteristics, such as spin, charge, approximate mass, and lifetime. If the quark picture is complete, the Ω−Ω− should exist. It was first observed in 1964 at Brookhaven National Laboratory and had the predicted characteristics as seen in Figure 33.16. The discovery of the Ω−Ω− was convincing indirect evidence for the existence of the three original quark flavors and boosted theoretical and experimental efforts to further explore particle physics in terms of quarks. Ω−Ω− ssssss −3−3 Ω−Ω− Ω−Ω− Patterns and Puzzles: Atoms, Nuclei, and Quarks Patterns in the properties of atoms allowed the periodic table to be developed. From it, previously unknown elements were predicted and observed. Similarly, patterns were observed in the properties of nuclei, leading to the chart of nuclides and successful predictions of previously unknown nuclides. Now with particle physics, patterns imply a quark substructure that, if taken literally, predicts previously unknown particles. These have now been observed in another triumph of underlying unity. Figure 33.16 The image relates to the discovery of the Ω−Ω−. It is a secondary reaction in which an accelerator-produced K−K− collides with a proton via the strong force and conserves strangeness to produce the Ω−Ω− with characteristics predicted by the quark model. As with other predictions of previously unobserved particles, this gave a tremendous boost to quark theory.

Page 396,"Patterns in the properties of atoms allowed the periodic table to be developed. From it, previously unknown elements were predicted and observed. Similarly, patterns were observed in the properties of nuclei, leading to the chart of nuclides and successful predictions of previously unknown nuclides. Now with particle physics, patterns imply a quark substructure that, if taken literally, predicts previously unknown particles. These have now been observed in another triumph of underlying unity."
Page 396,"At first, physicists expected that, with sufficient energy, we should be able to free quarks and observe them directly. This has not proved possible. There is still no direct observation of a fractional charge or any isolated quark. When large energies are put into collisions, other particles are created—but no quarks emerge. There is nearly direct evidence for quarks that is quite compelling. By 1967, experiments at SLAC scattering 20-GeV electrons from protons had produced results like Rutherford had obtained for the nucleus nearly 60 years earlier. The SLAC scattering experiments showed unambiguously that there were three pointlike (meaning they had sizes considerably smaller than the probe’s wavelength) charges inside the proton as seen in Figure 33.17. This evidence made all but the most skeptical admit that there was validity to the quark substructure of hadrons. Figure 33.17 Scattering of high-energy electrons from protons at facilities like SLAC produces evidence of three point-like charges consistent with proposed quark properties. This experiment is analogous to Rutherford’s discovery of the small size of the nucleus by scattering α particles. High-energy electrons are used so that the probe wavelength is small enough to see details smaller than the proton. More recent and higher-energy experiments have produced jets of particles in collisions, highly suggestive of three quarks in a nucleon. Since the quarks are very tightly bound, energy put into separating them pulls them only so far apart before it starts being converted into other particles. More energy produces more particles, not a separation of quarks. Conservation of momentum requires that the particles come out in jets along the three paths in which the quarks were being pulled. Note that there are only three jets, and that other characteristics of the particles are consistent with the three-quark substructure.

Page 396,"The quark model actually lost some of its early popularity because the original model with three quarks had to be modified. The up and down quarks seemed to compose normal matter as seen in Table 33.4, while the single strange quark explained strangeness. Why didn’t it have a counterpart? A fourth quark flavor called charm (c) was proposed as the counterpart of the strange quark to make things symmetric—there would be two normal quarks (u and d) and two exotic quarks (s and c). Furthermore, at that time only four leptons were known, two normal and two exotic. It was attractive that there would be four quarks and four leptons. The problem was that no known particles contained a charmed quark. Suddenly, in November of 1974, two groups (one headed by C. C. Ting at Brookhaven National Laboratory and the other by Burton Richter at SLAC) independently and nearly simultaneously discovered a new meson with characteristics that made it clear that its substructure is cc-cc-. It was called J by one group and psi (ψψ) by the other and now is known as the J/ψJ/ψ meson. Since then, numerous particles have been discovered containing the charmed quark, consistent in every way with the quark model. The discovery of the J/ψJ/ψ meson had such a rejuvenating effect on quark theory that it is now called the November Revolution. Ting and Richter shared the 1976 Nobel Prize. charm cc-cc- ψψ J/ψJ/ψ J/ψJ/ψ History quickly repeated itself. In 1975, the tau (ττ) was discovered, and a third family of leptons emerged as seen in Table 33.2).  Theorists quickly proposed two more quark flavors called top (t) or truth and bottom (b) or beauty to keep the number of quarks the same as the number of leptons. And in 1976, the upsilon (
ϒϒ) meson was discovered and shown to be composed of a bottom and an antibottom quark or bb-bb-, quite analogous to the J/ψJ/ψ being cc-cc- as seen in Table 33.4. Being a single flavor, these mesons are sometimes called bare charm and bare bottom and reveal the characteristics of their quarks most clearly. Other mesons containing bottom quarks have since been observed. In 1995, two groups at Fermilab confirmed the top quark’s existence, completing the picture of six quarks listed in Table 33.3. Each successive quark discovery—first cc, then bb, and finally tt —has required higher energy because each has higher mass. Quark masses in Table 33.3 are only approximately known, because they are not directly observed. They must be inferred from the masses of the particles they combine to form. ττ top bottom ϒϒ bb-bb- J/ψJ/ψ cc-cc- cc bb tt"
Page 396,"As mentioned and shown in Figure 33.15, quarks carry another quantum number, which we call color. Of course, it is not the color we sense with visible light, but its properties are analogous to those of three primary and three secondary colors. Specifically, a quark can have one of three color values we call red (RR), green (GG), and blue (BB) in analogy to those primary visible colors. Antiquarks have three values we call antired or cyanR-R-, antigreen or magentaG-G-, and antiblue or yellowB-B- in analogy to those secondary visible colors. The reason for these names is that when certain visual colors are combined, the eye sees white. The analogy of the colors combining to white is used to explain why baryons are made of three quarks, why mesons are a quark and an antiquark, and why we cannot isolate a single quark. The force between the quarks is such that their combined colors produce white. This is illustrated in Figure 33.19. A baryon must have one of each primary color or RGB, which produces white. A meson must have a primary color and its anticolor, also producing white. color RR GG BB R-R- G-G- B-B- Figure 33.19 The three quarks composing a baryon must be RGB, which add to white. The quark and antiquark composing a meson must be a color and anticolor, here RR-RR- also adding to white. The force between systems that have color is so great that they can neither be separated nor exist as colored. Why must hadrons be white? The color scheme is intentionally devised to explain why baryons have three quarks and mesons have a quark and an antiquark. Quark color is thought to be similar to charge, but with more values. An ion, by analogy, exerts much stronger forces than a neutral molecule. When the color of a combination of quarks is white, it is like a neutral atom. The forces a white particle exerts are like the polarization forces in molecules, but in hadrons these leftovers are the strong nuclear force. When a combination of quarks has color other than white, it exerts extremely large forces—even larger than the strong force—and perhaps cannot be stable or permanently separated. This is part of the theory of quark confinement, which explains how quarks can exist and yet never be isolated or directly observed. Finally, an extra quantum number with three values (like those we assign to color) is necessary for quarks to obey the Pauli exclusion principle. Particles such as the Ω−Ω−, which is composed of three strange quarks, ssssss, and the Δ++Δ++, which is three up quarks, uuu, can exist because the quarks have different colors and do not have the same quantum numbers. Color is consistent with all observations and is now widely accepted. Quark theory including color is called quantum chromodynamics (QCD), also named by Gell-Mann. theory of quark confinement Ω−Ω− ssssss Δ++Δ++ quantum chromodynamics"
Page 396,"Fundamental particles are thought to be one of three types—leptons, quarks, or carrier particles. Each of those three types is further divided into three analogous families as illustrated in Figure 33.20. We have examined leptons and quarks in some detail. Each has six members (and their six antiparticles) divided into three analogous families. The first family is normal matter, of which most things are composed. The second is exotic, and the third more exotic and more massive than the second. The only stable particles are in the first family, which also has unstable members. Always searching for symmetry and similarity, physicists have also divided the carrier particles into three families, omitting the graviton. Gravity is special among the four forces in that it affects the space and time in which the other forces exist and is proving most difficult to include in a Theory of Everything or TOE (to stub the pretension of such a theory). Gravity is thus often set apart. It is not certain that there is meaning in the groupings shown in Figure 33.20, but the analogies are tempting. In the past, we have been able to make significant advances by looking for analogies and patterns, and this is an example of one under current scrutiny. There are connections between the families of leptons, in that the ττ decays into the μμ and the μμ into the e. Similarly for quarks, the higher families eventually decay into the lowest, leaving only u and d quarks. We have long sought connections between the forces in nature. Since these are carried by particles, we will explore connections between gluons, W±W± and Z0Z0, and photons as part of the search for unification of forces discussed in GUTs: The Unification of Forces.. ττ μμ μμ W±W± Z0Z0 Figure 33.20 The three types of particles are leptons, quarks, and carrier particles.

Page 397,"Grand Unified Theory (GUT) is successful in describing the four forces as distinct under normal circumstances, but connected in fundamental ways. Experiments have verified that the weak and electromagnetic force become identical at very small distances and provide the GUT description of the carrier particles for the forces. GUT predicts that the other forces become identical under conditions so extreme that they cannot be tested in the laboratory, although there may be lingering evidence of them in the evolution of the universe. GUT is also successful in describing a system of carrier particles for all four forces, but there is much to be done, particularly in the realm of gravity."

They were detected from the 1987A supernova in the Magellanic Cloud, which is about 120,000 light years away from the Earth (relatively close to our Milky Way galaxy).

This is not a large time difference, given that it is impossible to know which neutrino left with which photon and the poor efficiency of the neutrino detectors. Thus, the fact that neutrinos were observed within hours of the brightening of the supernova only places an upper limit on the neutrino’s mass.

Page 404,"Einstein first considered the case of no observer acceleration when he developed the revolutionary special theory of relativity, publishing his first work on it in 1905. By 1916, he had laid the foundation of general relativity, again almost on his own. Much of what Einstein did to develop his ideas was to mentally analyze certain carefully and clearly defined situations—doing this is to perform a thought experiment. Figure 34.10 illustrates a thought experiment like the ones that convinced Einstein that light must fall in a gravitational field. Think about what a person feels in an elevator that is accelerated upward. It is identical to being in a stationary elevator in a gravitational field. The feet of a person are pressed against the floor, and objects released from hand fall with identical accelerations. In fact, it is not possible, without looking outside, to know what is happening—acceleration upward or gravity. This led Einstein to correctly postulate that acceleration and gravity will produce identical effects in all situations. So, if acceleration affects light, then gravity will, too. Figure 34.10 shows the effect of acceleration on a beam of light shone horizontally at one wall. Since the accelerated elevator moves up during the time light travels across the elevator, the beam of light strikes low, seeming to the person to bend down. (Normally a tiny effect, since the speed of light is so great.) The same effect must occur due to gravity, Einstein reasoned, since there is no way to tell the effects of gravity acting downward from acceleration of the elevator upward. Thus gravity affects the path of light, even though we think of gravity as acting between masses and photons are massless. thought experiment Figure 34.10 (a) A beam of light emerges from a flashlight in an upward-accelerating elevator. Since the elevator moves up during the time the light takes to reach the wall, the beam strikes lower than it would if the elevator were not accelerated. (b) Gravity has the same effect on light, since it is not possible to tell whether the elevator is accelerating upward or acted upon by gravity. Einstein’s theory of general relativity got its first verification in 1919 when starlight passing near the Sun was observed during a solar eclipse. (See Figure 34.11.) During an eclipse, the sky is darkened and we can briefly see stars. Those in a line of sight nearest the Sun should have a shift in their apparent positions. Not only was this shift observed, but it agreed with Einstein’s predictions well within experimental uncertainties. This discovery created a scientific and public sensation. Einstein was now a folk hero as well as a very great scientist. The bending of light by matter is equivalent to a bending of space itself, with light following the curve. This is another radical change in our concept of space and time. It is also another connection that any particle with mass or energy (massless photons) is affected by gravity. There are several current forefront efforts related to general relativity. One is the observation and analysis of gravitational lensing of light. Another is analysis of the definitive proof of the existence of black holes. Direct observation of gravitational waves or moving wrinkles in space is being searched for. Theoretical efforts are also being aimed at the possibility of time travel and wormholes into other parts of space due to black holes. Gravitational lensingAs you can see in Figure 34.11, light is bent toward a mass, producing an effect much like a converging lens (large masses are needed to produce observable effects). On a galactic scale, the light from a distant galaxy could be “lensed” into several images when passing close by another galaxy on its way to Earth. Einstein predicted this effect, but he considered it unlikely that we would ever observe it. A number of cases of this effect have now been observed; one is shown in Figure 34.12. This effect is a much larger scale verification of general relativity. But such gravitational lensing is also useful in verifying that the red shift is proportional to distance. The red shift of the intervening galaxy is always less than that of the one being lensed, and each image of the lensed galaxy has the same red shift. This verification supplies more evidence that red shift is proportional to distance. Confidence that the multiple images are not different objects is bolstered by the observations that if one image varies in brightness over time, the others also vary in the same manner. Gravitational lensing Figure 34.11 This schematic shows how light passing near a massive body like the Sun is curved toward it. The light that reaches the Earth then seems to be coming from different locations than the known positions of the originating stars. Not only was this effect observed, the amount of bending was precisely what Einstein predicted in his general theory of relativity. Figure 34.12 (a) Light from a distant galaxy can travel different paths to the Earth because it is bent around an intermediary galaxy by gravity. This produces several images of the more distant galaxy. (b) The images around the central galaxy are produced by gravitational lensing. Each image has the same spectrum and a larger red shift than the intermediary. (credit: NASA, ESA, and STScI) Black holesBlack holes are objects having such large gravitational fields that things can fall in, but nothing, not even light, can escape. Bodies, like the Earth or the Sun, have what is called an escape velocity. If an object moves straight up from the body, starting at the escape velocity, it will just be able to escape the gravity of the body. The greater the acceleration of gravity on the body, the greater is the escape velocity. As long ago as the late 1700s, it was proposed that if the escape velocity is greater than the speed of light, then light cannot escape. Simon Laplace (1749–1827), the French astronomer and mathematician, even incorporated this idea of a dark star into his writings. But the idea was dropped after Young’s double slit experiment showed light to be a wave. For some time, light was thought not to have particle characteristics and, thus, could not be acted upon by gravity. The idea of a black hole was very quickly reincarnated in 1916 after Einstein’s theory of general relativity was published. It is now thought that black holes can form in the supernova collapse of a massive star, forming an object perhaps 10 km across and having a mass greater than that of our Sun. It is interesting that several prominent physicists who worked on the concept, including Einstein, firmly believed that nature would find a way to prohibit such objects. Black holes Black holes escape velocity Black holes are difficult to observe directly, because they are small and no light comes directly from them. In fact, no light comes from inside the event horizon, which is defined to be at a distance from the object at which the escape velocity is exactly the speed of light. The radius of the event horizon is known as the Schwarzschild radius RSRS and is given by event horizon Schwarzschild radius RSRS 34.2 where GG is the universal gravitational constant, MM is the mass of the body, and cc is the speed of light. The event horizon is the edge of the black hole and RSRS is its radius (that is, the size of a black hole is twice RSRS). Since GG is small and c2c2 is large, you can see that black holes are extremely small, only a few kilometers for masses a little greater than the Sun’s. The object itself is inside the event horizon. GG MM cc RSRS RSRS GG c2c2 Physics near a black hole is fascinating. Gravity increases so rapidly that, as you approach a black hole, the tidal effects tear matter apart, with matter closer to the hole being pulled in with much more force than that only slightly farther away. This can pull a companion star apart and heat inflowing gases to the point of producing X rays. (See Figure 34.13.) We have observed X rays from certain binary star systems that are consistent with such a picture. This is not quite proof of black holes, because the X rays could also be caused by matter falling onto a neutron star. These objects were first discovered in 1967 by the British astrophysicists, Jocelyn Bell and Anthony Hewish. Neutron stars are literally a star composed of neutrons. They are formed by the collapse of a star’s core in a supernova, during which electrons and protons are forced together to form neutrons (the reverse of neutron ββ decay). Neutron stars are slightly larger than a black hole of the same mass and will not collapse further because of resistance by the strong force. However, neutron stars cannot have a mass greater than about eight solar masses or they must collapse to a black hole. With recent improvements in our ability to resolve small details, such as with the orbiting Chandra X-ray Observatory, it has become possible to measure the masses of X-ray-emitting objects by observing the motion of companion stars and other matter in their vicinity. What has emerged is a plethora of X-ray-emitting objects too massive to be neutron stars. This evidence is considered conclusive and the existence of black holes is widely accepted. These black holes are concentrated near galactic centers. Neutron stars ββ We also have evidence that supermassive black holes may exist at the cores of many galaxies, including the Milky Way. Such a black hole might have a mass millions or even billions of times that of the Sun, and it would probably have formed when matter first coalesced into a galaxy billions of years ago. Supporting this is the fact that very distant galaxies are more likely to have abnormally energetic cores. Some of the moderately distant galaxies, and hence among the younger, are known as quasars and emit as much or more energy than a normal galaxy but from a region less than a light year across. Quasar energy outputs may vary in times less than a year, so that the energy-emitting region must be less than a light year across. The best explanation of quasars is that they are young galaxies with a supermassive black hole forming at their core, and that they become less energetic over billions of years. In closer superactive galaxies, we observe tremendous amounts of energy being emitted from very small regions of space, consistent with stars falling into a black hole at the rate of one or more a month. The Hubble Space Telescope (1994) observed an accretion disk in the galaxy M87 rotating rapidly around a region of extreme energy emission. (See Figure 34.13.) A jet of material being ejected perpendicular to the plane of rotation gives further evidence of a supermassive black hole as the engine. quasars Figure 34.13 A black hole is shown pulling matter away from a companion star, forming a superheated accretion disk where X rays are emitted before the matter disappears forever into the hole. The in-fall energy also ejects some material, forming the two vertical spikes. (See also the photograph in the Introduction to Frontiers of Physics.) There are several X-ray-emitting objects in space that are consistent with this picture and are likely to be black holes. Gravitational wavesIf a massive object distorts the space around it, like the foot of a water bug on the surface of a pond, then movement of the massive object should create waves in space like those on a pond. Gravitational waves are mass-created distortions in space that propagate at the speed of light and are predicted by general relativity. Since gravity is by far the weakest force, extreme conditions are needed to generate significant gravitational waves. Gravity near binary neutron star systems is so great that significant gravitational wave energy is radiated as the two neutron stars orbit one another. American astronomers, Joseph Taylor and Russell Hulse, measured changes in the orbit of such a binary neutron star system. They found its orbit to change precisely as predicted by general relativity, a strong indication of gravitational waves, and were awarded the 1993 Nobel Prize. But direct detection of gravitational waves on Earth would be conclusive. For many years, various attempts have been made to detect gravitational waves by observing vibrations induced in matter distorted by these waves. American physicist Joseph Weber pioneered this field in the 1960s, but no conclusive events have been observed. (No gravity wave detectors were in operation at the time of the 1987A supernova, unfortunately.) There are now several ambitious systems of gravitational wave detectors in use around the world. These include the LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory) system with two laser interferometer detectors, one in the state of Washington and another in Louisiana (See Figure 34.15) and the VIRGO (Variability of Irradiance and Gravitational Oscillations) facility in Italy with a single detector.

Page 404,"Black holes radiateQuantum gravity is important in those situations where gravity is so extremely strong that it has effects on the quantum scale, where the other forces are ordinarily much stronger. The early universe was such a place, but black holes are another. The first significant connection between gravity and quantum effects was made by the Russian physicist Yakov Zel’dovich in 1971, and other significant advances followed from the British physicist Stephen Hawking. (See Figure 34.16.) These two showed that black holes could radiate away energy by quantum effects just outside the event horizon (nothing can escape from inside the event horizon). Black holes are, thus, expected to radiate energy and shrink to nothing, although extremely slowly for most black holes. The mechanism is the creation of a particle-antiparticle pair from energy in the extremely strong gravitational field near the event horizon. One member of the pair falls into the hole and the other escapes, conserving momentum. (See Figure 34.17.) When a black hole loses energy and, hence, rest mass, its event horizon shrinks, creating an even greater gravitational field. This increases the rate of pair production so that the process grows exponentially until the black hole is nuclear in size. A final burst of particles and γγ rays ensues. This is an extremely slow process for black holes about the mass of the Sun (produced by supernovas) or larger ones (like those thought to be at galactic centers), taking on the order of 10671067 years or longer! Smaller black holes would evaporate faster, but they are only speculated to exist as remnants of the Big Bang. Searches for characteristic γγ-ray bursts have produced events attributable to more mundane objects like neutron stars accreting matter. Black holes radiate γγ 10671067 γγ Figure 34.14 This Hubble Space Telescope photograph shows the extremely energetic core of the NGC 4261 galaxy. With the superior resolution of the orbiting telescope, it has been possible to observe the rotation of an accretion disk around the energy-producing object as well as to map jets of material being ejected from the object. A supermassive black hole is consistent with these observations, but other possibilities are not quite eliminated.

Gravitational waves will cause extremely small vibrations in a mass in this detector, which will be detected by laser interferometer techniques. Such detection in coincidence with other detectors and with astronomical events, such as supernovas, would provide direct evidence of gravitational waves. (credit: Tobin Fricke) Figure 34.16 Stephen Hawking (b. 1942) has made many contributions to the theory of quantum gravity. Hawking is a long-time survivor of ALS and has produced popular books on general relativity, cosmology, and quantum gravity. (credit: Lwp Kommunikáció) Figure 34.17 Gravity and quantum mechanics come into play when a black hole creates a particle-antiparticle pair from the energy in its gravitational field. One member of the pair falls into the hole while the other escapes, removing energy and shrinking the black hole. The search is on for the characteristic energy. Wormholes and time travel The subject of time travel captures the imagination. Theoretical physicists, such as the American Kip Thorne, have treated the subject seriously, looking into the possibility that falling into a black hole could result in popping up in another time and place—a trip through a so-called wormhole. Time travel and wormholes appear in innumerable science fiction dramatizations, but the consensus is that time travel is not possible in theory. While still debated, it appears that quantum gravity effects inside a black hole prevent time travel due to the creation of particle pairs. Direct evidence is elusive. Wormholes and time travel The shortest time Theoretical studies indicate that, at extremely high energies and correspondingly early in the universe, quantum fluctuations may make time intervals meaningful only down to some finite time limit. Early work indicated that this might be the case for times as long as 10−43s10−43s, the time at which all forces were unified. If so, then it would be meaningless to consider the universe at times earlier than this. Subsequent studies indicate that the crucial time may be as short as 10−95s10−95s. But the point remains—quantum gravity seems to imply that there is no such thing as a vanishingly short time. Time may, in fact, be grainy with no meaning to time intervals shorter than some tiny but finite size. The shortest time 10−43s10−43s 10−95s10−95s The future of quantum gravity Not only is quantum gravity in its infancy, no one knows how to get started on a theory of gravitons and unification of forces. The energies at which TOE should be valid may be so high (at least 1019GeV1019GeV) and the necessary particle separation so small (less than 10−35m10−35m) that only indirect evidence can provide clues. For some time, the common lament of theoretical physicists was one so familiar to struggling students—how do you even get started? But Hawking and others have made a start, and the approach  many theorists have taken is called Superstring theory, the topic of the Superstrings.

Page 406,"The first clues that there is more matter than meets the eye came from the Swiss-born American astronomer Fritz Zwicky in the 1930s; major work was also done by the American astronomer Vera Rubin. Zwicky measured the velocities of stars orbiting the galaxy, using the relativistic Doppler shift of their spectra (see Figure 34.18(a)). He found that velocity varied with distance from the center of the galaxy, as graphed in Figure 34.18(b). If the mass of the galaxy was concentrated in its center, as are its luminous stars, the velocities should decrease as the square root of the distance from the center. Instead, the velocity curve is almost flat, implying that there is a tremendous amount of matter in the galactic halo. Using instruments and methods that offered a greater degree of precision, Rubin investigated the movement of spiral galaxies and observed that their outermost reaches were rotating as quickly as their centers. She also calculated that the rotational velocity of galaxies should have been enough to cause them to fly apart, unless there was a significant discrepancy between their observable matter and their actual matter. This became known as the galaxy rotation problem, which can be ""solved"" by the presence of unobserved or dark matter. Although not immediately recognized for its significance, such measurements have now been made for many galaxies, with similar results. Further, studies of galactic clusters have also indicated that galaxies have a mass distribution greater than that obtained from their brightness (proportional to the number of stars), which also extends into large halos surrounding the luminous parts of galaxies. Observations of other EM wavelengths, such as radio waves and X rays, have similarly confirmed the existence of dark matter. Take, for example, X rays in the relatively dark space between galaxies, which indicates the presence of previously unobserved hot, ionized gas (see Figure 34.18(c))."
Page 406,"Is the universe open or closed? That is, will the universe expand forever or will it stop, perhaps to contract? This, until recently, was a question of whether there is enough gravitation to stop the expansion of the universe. In the past few years, it has become a question of the combination of gravitation and what is called the cosmological constant. The cosmological constant was invented by Einstein to prohibit the expansion or contraction of the universe. At the time he developed general relativity, Einstein considered that an illogical possibility. The cosmological constant was discarded after Hubble discovered the expansion, but has been re-invoked in recent years. cosmological constant Gravitational attraction between galaxies is slowing the expansion of the universe, but the amount of slowing down is not known directly. In fact, the cosmological constant can counteract gravity’s effect. As recent measurements indicate, the universe is expanding faster now than in the past—perhaps a “modern inflationary era” in which the dark energy is thought to be causing the expansion of the present-day universe to accelerate. If the expansion rate were affected by gravity alone, we should be able to see that the expansion rate between distant galaxies was once greater than it is now. However, measurements show it was less than now. We can, however, calculate the amount of slowing based on the average density of matter we observe directly. Here we have a definite answer—there is far less visible matter than needed to stop expansion. The critical density ρcρc is defined to be the density needed to just halt universal expansion in a universe with no cosmological constant. It is estimated to be about critical density ρcρc 34.3 However, this estimate of ρcρc is only good to about a factor of two, due to uncertainties in the expansion rate of the universe. The critical density is equivalent to an average of only a few nucleons per cubic meter, remarkably small and indicative of how truly empty intergalactic space is. Luminous matter seems to account for roughly 0.5%0.5% to 2%2% of the critical density, far less than that needed for closure. Taking into account the amount of dark matter we detect indirectly and all other types of indirectly observed normal matter, there is only 10%10% to 40%40% of what is needed for closure. If we are able to refine the measurements of expansion rates now and in the past, we will have our answer regarding the curvature of space and we will determine a value for the cosmological constant to justify this observation. Finally, the most recent measurements of the CMBR have implications for the cosmological constant, so it is not simply a device concocted for a single purpose. ρcρc 0.5%0.5% 2%2% 10%10% 40%40% After the recent experimental discovery of the cosmological constant, most researchers feel that the universe should be just barely open. Since matter can be thought to curve the space around it, we call an open universe negatively curved. This means that you can in principle travel an unlimited distance in any direction. A universe that is closed is called positively curved. This means that if you travel far enough in any direction, you will return to your starting point, analogous to circumnavigating the Earth. In between these two is a flat (zero curvature) universe. The recent discovery of the cosmological constant has shown the universe is very close to flat, and will expand forever. Why do theorists feel the universe is flat? Flatness is a part of the inflationary scenario that helps explain the flatness of the microwave background. In fact, since general relativity implies that matter creates the space in which it exists, there is a special symmetry to a flat universe. negatively curved positively curved flat (zero curvature) universe Figure 34.18 Evidence for dark matter: (a) We can measure the velocities of stars relative to their galaxies by observing the Doppler shift in emitted light, usually using the hydrogen spectrum. These measurements indicate the rotation of a spiral galaxy. (b) A graph of velocity versus distance from the galactic center shows that the velocity does not decrease as it would if the matter were concentrated in luminous stars. The flatness of the curve implies a massive galactic halo of dark matter extending beyond the visible stars. (c) This is a computer-generated image of X rays from a galactic cluster. The X rays indicate the presence of otherwise unseen hot clouds of ionized gas in the regions of space previously considered more empty. (credit: NASA, ESA, CXC, M.

Page 406,"There is no doubt that dark matter exists, but its form and the amount in existence are two facts that are still being studied vigorously. As always, we seek to explain new observations in terms of known principles. However, as more discoveries are made, it is becoming more and more difficult to explain dark matter as a known type of matter. One of the possibilities for normal matter is being explored using the Hubble Space Telescope and employing the lensing effect of gravity on light (see Figure 34.19). Stars glow because of nuclear fusion in them, but planets are visible primarily by reflected light. Jupiter, for example, is too small to ignite fusion in its core and become a star, but we can see sunlight reflected from it, since we are relatively close. If Jupiter orbited another star, we would not be able to see it directly. The question is open as to how many planets or other bodies smaller than about 1/1000 the mass of the Sun are there. If such bodies pass between us and a star, they will not block the star’s light, being too small, but they will form a gravitational lens, as discussed in General Relativity and Quantum Gravity. In a process called microlensing, light from the star is focused and the star appears to brighten in a characteristic manner. Searches for dark matter in this form are particularly interested in galactic halos because of the huge amount of mass that seems to be there. Such microlensing objects are thus called massive compact halo objects, or MACHOs. To date, a few MACHOs have been observed, but not predominantly in galactic halos, nor in the numbers needed to explain dark matter. microlensing massive compact halo objects MACHOs MACHOs are among the most conventional of unseen objects proposed to explain dark matter. Others being actively pursued are red dwarfs, which are small dim stars, but too few have been seen so far, even with the Hubble Telescope, to be of significance. Old remnants of stars called white dwarfs are also under consideration, since they contain about a solar mass, but are small as the Earth and may dim to the point that we ordinarily do not observe them. While white dwarfs are known, old dim ones are not. Yet another possibility is the existence of large numbers of smaller than stellar mass black holes left from the Big Bang—here evidence is entirely absent. There is a very real possibility that dark matter is composed of the known neutrinos, which may have small, but finite, masses. As discussed earlier, neutrinos are thought to be massless, but we only have upper limits on their masses, rather than knowing they are exactly zero. So far, these upper limits come from difficult measurements of total energy emitted in the decays and reactions in which neutrinos are involved. There is an amusing possibility of proving that neutrinos have mass in a completely different way. We have noted in Particles, Patterns, and Conservation Laws that there are three flavors of neutrinos (νeνe, vμvμ, and vτvτ) and that the weak interaction could change quark flavor. It should also change neutrino flavor—that is, any type of neutrino could change spontaneously into any other, a process called neutrino oscillations. However, this can occur only if neutrinos have a mass. Why? Crudely, because if neutrinos are massless, they must travel at the speed of light and time will not pass for them, so that they cannot change without an interaction. In 1999, results began to be published containing convincing evidence that neutrino oscillations do occur. Using the Super-Kamiokande detector in Japan, the oscillations have been observed and are being verified and further explored at present at the same facility and others. νeνe vμvμ vτvτ neutrino oscillations Neutrino oscillations may also explain the low number of observed solar neutrinos. Detectors for observing solar neutrinos are specifically designed to detect electron neutrinos νeνe produced in huge numbers by fusion in the Sun. A large fraction of electron neutrinos νeνe may be changing flavor to muon neutrinos vμvμ on their way out of the Sun, possibly enhanced by specific interactions, reducing the flux of electron neutrinos to observed levels. There is also a discrepancy in observations of neutrinos produced in cosmic ray showers. While these showers of radiation produced by extremely energetic cosmic rays should contain twice as many vμvμ s as νeνe s, their numbers are nearly equal. This may be explained by neutrino oscillations from muon flavor to electron flavor. Massive neutrinos are a particularly appealing possibility for explaining dark matter, since their existence is consistent with a large body of known information and explains more than dark matter. The question is not settled at this writing. νeνe νeνe vμvμ vμvμ νeνe The most radical proposal to explain dark matter is that it consists of previously unknown leptons (sometimes obtusely referred to as non-baryonic matter). These are called weakly interacting massive particles, or WIMPs, and would also be chargeless, thus interacting negligibly with normal matter, except through gravitation. One proposed group of WIMPs would have masses several orders of magnitude greater than nucleons and are sometimes called neutralinos. Others are called axions and would have masses about 10−1010−10 that of an electron mass. Both neutralinos and axions would be gravitationally attached to galaxies, but because they are chargeless and only feel the weak force, they would be in a halo rather than interact and coalesce into spirals, and so on, like normal matter (see Figure 34.20). weakly interacting massive particles WIMPs neutralinos axions 10−1010−10 Figure 34.19 The Hubble Space Telescope is producing exciting data with its corrected optics and with the absence of atmospheric distortion. It has observed some MACHOs, disks of material around stars thought to precede planet formation, black hole candidates, and collisions of comets with Jupiter. (credit: NASA (crew of STS-125)) Figure 34.20 Dark matter may shepherd normal matter gravitationally in space, as this stream moves the leaves. Dark matter may be invisible and even move through the normal matter, as neutrinos penetrate us without small-scale effect. (credit: Shinichi Sugiyama) Some particle theorists have built WIMPs into their unified force theories and into the inflationary scenario of the evolution of the universe so popular today. These particles would have been produced in just the correct numbers to make the universe flat, shortly after the Big Bang. The proposal is radical in the sense that it invokes entirely new forms of matter, in fact two entirely new forms, in order to explain dark matter and other phenomena. WIMPs have the extra burden of automatically being very difficult to observe directly. This is somewhat analogous to quark confinement, which guarantees that quarks are there, but they can never be seen directly. One of the primary goals of the LHC at CERN, however, is to produce and detect WIMPs. At any rate, before WIMPs are accepted as the best explanation, all other possibilities utilizing known phenomena will have to be shown inferior. Should that occur, we will be in the unanticipated position of admitting that, to date, all we know is only 10% of what exists. A far cry from the days when people firmly believed themselves to be not only the center of the universe, but also the reason for its existence."

Page 411,34.7 Some Questions We Know to Ask
Page 412,"34.1 Cosmology and Particle Physics 1 . Explain why it only appears that we are at the center of expansion of the universe and why an observer in another galaxy would see the same relative motion of all but the closest galaxies away from her. 2 . If there is no observable edge to the universe, can we determine where its center of expansion is? Explain. 3 . If the universe is infinite, does it have a center? Discuss. 4 . Another known cause of red shift in light is the source being in a high gravitational field. Discuss how this can be eliminated as the source of galactic red shifts, given that the shifts are proportional to distance and not to the size of the galaxy. 5 . If some unknown cause of red shift—such as light becoming “tired” from traveling long distances through empty space—is discovered, what effect would there be on cosmology? 6 . Olbers’s paradox poses an interesting question: If the universe is infinite, then any line of sight should eventually fall on a star’s surface. Why then is the sky dark at night? Discuss the commonly accepted evolution of the universe as a solution to this paradox. 7 . If the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR) is the remnant of the Big Bang’s fireball, we expect to see hot and cold regions in it. What are two causes of these wrinkles in the CMBR? Are the observed temperature variations greater or less than originally expected? 8 . The decay of one type of KK-meson is cited as evidence that nature favors matter over antimatter. Since mesons are composed of a quark and an antiquark, is it surprising that they would preferentially decay to one type over another? Is this an asymmetry in nature? Is the predominance of matter over antimatter an asymmetry? KK 9 . Distances to local galaxies are determined by measuring the brightness of stars, called Cepheid variables, that can be observed individually and that have absolute brightnesses at a standard distance that are well known. Explain how the measured brightness would vary with distance as compared with the absolute brightness. 10 . Distances to very remote galaxies are estimated based on their apparent type, which indicate the number of stars in the galaxy, and their measured brightness. Explain how the measured brightness would vary with distance. Would there be any correction necessary to compensate for the red shift of the galaxy (all distant galaxies have significant red shifts)? Discuss possible causes of uncertainties in these measurements. 11 . If the smallest meaningful time interval is greater than zero, will the lines in Figure 34.9 ever meet?"
Page 412,1 . Explain why it only appears that we are at the center of expansion of the universe and why an observer in another galaxy would see the same relative motion of all but the closest galaxies away from her.
Page 412,"34.2 General Relativity and Quantum Gravity 12 . Quantum gravity, if developed, would be an improvement on both general relativity and quantum mechanics, but more mathematically difficult. Under what circumstances would it be necessary to use quantum gravity? Similarly, under what circumstances could general relativity be used? When could special relativity, quantum mechanics, or classical physics  be used? 13 . Does observed gravitational lensing correspond to a converging or diverging lens? Explain briefly. 14 . Suppose you measure the red shifts of all the images produced by gravitational lensing, such as in Figure 34.12.You find that the central image has a red shift less than the outer images, and those all have the same red shift. Discuss how this not only shows that the images are of the same object, but also implies that the red shift is not affected by taking different paths through space. Does it imply that cosmological red shifts are not caused by traveling through space (light getting tired, perhaps)? 15 . What are gravitational waves, and have they yet been observed either directly or indirectly? 16 . Is the event horizon of a black hole the actual physical surface of the object? 17 . Suppose black holes radiate their mass away and the lifetime of a black hole created by a supernova is about 10671067 years. How does this lifetime compare with the accepted age of the universe? Is it surprising that we do not observe the predicted characteristic radiation? 10671067"
Page 412,"34.4 Dark Matter and Closure 18 . Discuss the possibility that star velocities at the edges of galaxies being greater than expected is due to unknown properties of gravity rather than to the existence of dark matter. Would this mean, for example, that gravity is greater or smaller than expected at large distances? Are there other tests that could be made of gravity at large distances, such as observing the motions of neighboring galaxies? 19 . How does relativistic time dilation prohibit neutrino oscillations if they are massless? 20 . If neutrino oscillations do occur, will they violate conservation of the various lepton family numbers (LeLe, LμLμ, and LτLτ)? Will neutrino oscillations violate conservation of the total number of leptons? LeLe LμLμ LτLτ 21 . Lacking direct evidence of WIMPs as dark matter, why must we eliminate all other possible explanations based on the known forms of matter before we invoke their existence?"
Page 412,34.5 Complexity and Chaos 22 . Must a complex system be adaptive to be of interest in the field of complexity? Give an example to support your answer. 23 . State a necessary condition for a system to be chaotic.
Page 412,"34.6 High-temperature Superconductors 24 . What is critical temperature TcTc? Do all materials have a critical temperature? Explain why or why not. TcTc 25 . Explain how good thermal contact with liquid nitrogen can keep objects at a temperature of 77 K (liquid nitrogen’s boiling point at atmospheric pressure). 26 . Not only is liquid nitrogen a cheaper coolant than liquid helium, its boiling point is higher (77 K vs. 4.2 K). How does higher temperature help lower the cost of cooling a material? Explain in terms of the rate of heat transfer being related to the temperature difference between the sample and its surroundings."
Page 412,"34.7 Some Questions We Know to Ask 27 . For experimental evidence, particularly of previously unobserved phenomena, to be taken seriously it must be reproducible or of sufficiently high quality that a single observation is meaningful. Supernova 1987A is not reproducible. How do we know observations of it were valid? The fifth force is not broadly accepted. Is this due to lack of reproducibility or poor-quality experiments (or both)? Discuss why forefront experiments are more subject to observational problems than those involving established phenomena. 28 . Discuss whether you think there are limits to what humans can understand about the laws of physics. Support your arguments."

Show that the velocity of a star orbiting its galaxy in a circular orbit is inversely proportional to the square root of its orbital radius, assuming the mass of the stars inside its orbit acts like a single mass at the center of the galaxy. You may use an equation from a previous chapter to support your conclusion, but you must justify its use and define all terms used. . The core of a star collapses during a supernova, forming a neutron star. Angular momentum of the core is conserved, and so the neutron star spins rapidly.
