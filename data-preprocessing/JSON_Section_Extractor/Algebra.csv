Page 2,"The most basic numbers used in algebra are the numbers we use to count objects in our world: 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on. These are called the counting numbers. Counting numbers are also called natural numbers. If we add zero to the counting numbers, we get the set of whole numbers. counting number whole number Counting Numbers: 1, 2, 3, … Whole Numbers: 0, 1, 2, 3, … The notation “…” is called ellipsis and means “and so on,” or that the pattern continues endlessly. We can visualize counting numbers and whole numbers on a number line (see Figure 1.2). number line Figure 1.2 The numbers on the number line get larger as they go from left to right, and smaller as they go from right to left. While this number line shows only the whole numbers 0 through 6, the numbers keep going without end. Manipulative Mathematics Our number system is called a place value system, because the value of a digit depends on its position in a number. Figure 1.3 shows the place values. The place values are separated into groups of three, which are called periods. The periods are ones, thousands, millions, billions, trillions, and so on. In a written number, commas separate the periods. number system place values Figure 1.3 The number 5,278,194 is shown in the chart. The digit 5 is in the millions place. The digit 2 is in the hundred-thousands place. The digit 7 is in the ten-thousands place. The digit 8 is in the thousands place. The digit 1 is in the hundreds place. The digit 9 is in the tens place. The digit 4 is in the ones place. Example 1.1 In the number 63,407,218, find the place value of each digit: ⓐ ⓑ ⓒ ⓓ ⓔ Solution Place the number in the place value chart: ⓐ The 7 is in the thousands place.
ⓑ The 0 is in the ten thousands place.
ⓒ The 1 is in the tens place.
ⓓ The 6 is in the ten-millions place.
ⓔ The 3 is in the millions place. ⓐ ⓑ ⓒ ⓓ ⓔ Try It 1.1 For the number 27,493,615, find the place value of each digit: ⓐ 2 ⓑ 1 ⓒ 4 ⓓ 7 ⓔ 5 ⓐ ⓑ ⓒ ⓓ ⓔ Try It 1.2 For the number 519,711,641,328, find the place value of each digit: ⓐ 9 ⓑ 4 ⓒ 2 ⓓ 6 ⓔ 7 ⓐ ⓑ ⓒ ⓓ ⓔ When you write a check, you write out the number in words as well as in digits. To write a number in words, write the number in each period, followed by the name of the period, without the s at the end. Start at the left, where the periods have the largest value. The ones period is not named. The commas separate the periods, so wherever there is a comma in the number, put a comma between the words (see Figure 1.4). The number 74,218,369 is written as seventy-four million, two hundred eighteen thousand, three hundred sixty-nine. Figure 1.4 How To Name a Whole Number in Words. Step 1. Start at the left and name the number in each period, followed by the period name. Step 2. Put commas in the number to separate the periods. Step 3. Do not name the ones period. Example 1.2 Name the number 8,165,432,098,710 using words. Solution Name the number in each period, followed by the period name. Put the commas in to separate the periods. So, 8,165,432,098,7108,165,432,098,710 is named as eight trillion, one hundred sixty-five billion, four hundred thirty-two million, ninety-eight thousand, seven hundred ten. 8,165,432,098,7108,165,432,098,710 Try It 1.3 Name the number 9,258,137,904,0619,258,137,904,061 using words. 9,258,137,904,0619,258,137,904,061 Try It 1.4 Name the number 17,864,325,619,00417,864,325,619,004 using words. 17,864,325,619,00417,864,325,619,004 We are now going to reverse the process by writing the digits from the name of the number. To write the number in digits, we first look for the clue words that indicate the periods. It is helpful to draw three blanks for the needed periods and then fill in the blanks with the numbers, separating the periods with commas. How To Write a Whole Number Using Digits. Step 1. Identify the words that indicate periods. (Remember, the ones period is never named.) Step 2. Draw three blanks to indicate the number of places needed in each period. Separate the periods by commas. Step 3. Name the number in each period and place the digits in the correct place value position. Example 1.3 Write nine billion, two hundred forty-six million, seventy-three thousand, one hundred eighty-nine as a whole number using digits. Solution Identify the words that indicate periods.
Except for the first period, all other periods must have three places. Draw three blanks to indicate the number of places needed in each period. Separate the periods by commas.
Then write the digits in each period. The number is 9,246,073,189. Try It 1.5 Write the number two billion, four hundred sixty-six million, seven hundred fourteen thousand, fifty-one as a whole number using digits. Try It 1.6 Write the number eleven billion, nine hundred twenty-one million, eight hundred thirty thousand, one hundred six as a whole number using digits. In 2013, the U.S. Census Bureau estimated the population of the state of New York as 19,651,127. We could say the population of New York was approximately 20 million. In many cases, you don’t need the exact value; an approximate number is good enough. The process of approximating a number is called rounding. Numbers are rounded to a specific place value, depending on how much accuracy is needed. Saying that the population of New York is approximately 20 million means that we rounded to the millions place. rounding Example 1.4 Round 23,658 to the nearest hundred. Solution Try It 1.7 Round to the nearest hundred: 17,852.17,852. 17,852.17,852. Try It 1.8 Round to the nearest hundred: 468,751.468,751. 468,751.468,751. How To Round Whole Numbers. Step 1. Locate the given place value and mark it with an arrow. All digits to the left of the arrow do not change. Step 2. Underline the digit to the right of the given place value. Step 3. Step 4. Replace all digits to the right of the given place value with zeros.

Page 2,"The numbers 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 are called multiples of 2. A multiple of 2 can be written as the product of 2 and a counting number. multiples product Similarly, a multiple of 3 would be the product of a counting number and 3. We could find the multiples of any number by continuing this process. Manipulative Mathematics Table 1.1 shows the multiples of 2 through 9 for the first 12 counting numbers. Table 1.1 Multiple of a Number A number is a multiple of n if it is the product of a counting number and n. Another way to say that 15 is a multiple of 3 is to say that 15 is divisible by 3. That means that when we divide 15 by 3, we get a counting number. In fact, 15÷315÷3 is 5, so 15 is 5·3.5·3. divisible 15÷315÷3 5·3.5·3. Divisible by a Number If a number m is a multiple of n, then m is divisible by n. Look at the multiples of 5 in Table 1.1. They all end in 5 or 0. Numbers with last digit of 5 or 0 are divisible by 5. Looking for other patterns in Table 1.1 that shows multiples of the numbers 2 through 9, we can discover the following divisibility tests: Divisibility Tests A number is divisible by: Example 1.6 Is 5,625 divisible by 2? By 3? By 5? By 6? By 10? Solution Try It 1.11 Determine whether 4,962 is divisible by 2, by 3, by 5, by 6, and by 10. Try It 1.12 Determine whether 3,765 is divisible by 2, by 3, by 5, by 6, and by 10."
Page 2,"In mathematics, there are often several ways to talk about the same ideas. So far, we’ve seen that if m is a multiple of n, we can say that m is divisible by n. For example, since 72 is a multiple of 8, we say 72 is divisible by 8. Since 72 is a multiple of 9, we say 72 is divisible by 9. We can express this still another way. Since 8·9=72,8·9=72, we say that 8 and 9 are factors of 72. When we write 72=8·9,72=8·9, we say we have factored 72. 8·9=72,8·9=72, factors 72=8·9,72=8·9, Other ways to factor 72 are 1·72,2·36,3·24,4·18,and6·12.1·72,2·36,3·24,4·18,and6·12. Seventy-two has many factors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 36, and 72. 1·72,2·36,3·24,4·18,and6·12.1·72,2·36,3·24,4·18,and6·12. Factors In the expression a·ba·b, both a and b are called factors. If a·b=ma·b=m and both a and b are integers, then a and b are factors of m. a·ba·b factors a·b=ma·b=m factors Some numbers, like 72, have many factors. Other numbers have only two factors. Manipulative Mathematics Prime Number and Composite Number A prime number is a counting number greater than 1, whose only factors are 1 and itself. prime number A composite number is a counting number that is not prime. A composite number has factors other than 1 and itself. composite number Manipulative Mathematics The counting numbers from 2 to 19 are listed in Figure 1.5, with their factors. Make sure to agree with the “prime” or “composite” label for each! Figure 1.5 The prime numbers less than 20 are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, and 19. Notice that the only even prime number is 2. prime number A composite number can be written as a unique product of primes. This is called the prime factorization of the number. Finding the prime factorization of a composite number will be useful later in this course. product prime factorization Prime Factorization The prime factorization of a number is the product of prime numbers that equals the number. These prime numbers are called the prime factors. prime factorization To find the prime factorization of a composite number, find any two factors of the number and use them to create two branches. If a factor is prime, that branch is complete. Circle that prime! If the factor is not prime, find two factors of the number and continue the process. Once all the branches have circled primes at the end, the factorization is complete. The composite number can now be written as a product of prime numbers. Example 1.7 Factor 48. Solution We say 2·2·2·2·32·2·2·2·3 is the prime factorization of 48. We generally write the primes in ascending order. Be sure to multiply the factors to verify your answer! 2·2·2·2·32·2·2·2·3 If we first factored 48 in a different way, for example as 6·8,6·8, the result would still be the same. Finish the prime factorization and verify this for yourself. 6·8,6·8, Try It 1.13 Find the prime factorization of 80. Try It 1.14 Find the prime factorization of 60. How To Find the Prime Factorization of a Composite Number. Step 1. Find two factors whose product is the given number, and use these numbers to create two branches. Step 2. If a factor is prime, that branch is complete. Circle the prime, like a bud on the tree. Step 3. If a factor is not prime, write it as the product of two factors and continue the process. Step 4. Write the composite number as the product of all the circled primes. Example 1.8 Find the prime factorization of 252. Solution Try It 1.15 Find the prime factorization of 126. Try It 1.16 Find the prime factorization of 294. One of the reasons we look at multiples and primes is to use these techniques to find the least common multiple of two numbers. This will be useful when we add and subtract fractions with different denominators. Two methods are used most often to find the least common multiple and we will look at both of them. least common multiple denominator The first method is the Listing Multiples Method. To find the least common multiple of 12 and 18, we list the first few multiples of 12 and 18: Notice that some numbers appear in both lists. They are the common multiples of 12 and 18. We see that the first few common multiples of 12 and 18 are 36, 72, and 108. Since 36 is the smallest of the common multiples, we call it the least common multiple. We often use the abbreviation LCM. Least Common Multiple The least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of both numbers. least common multiple The procedure box lists the steps to take to find the LCM using the prime factors method we used above for 12 and 18. How To Find the Least Common Multiple by Listing Multiples. Step 1. List several multiples of each number. Step 2. Look for the smallest number that appears on both lists. Step 3. This number is the LCM. Example 1.9 Find the least common multiple of 15 and 20 by listing multiples. Solution Notice that 120 is in both lists, too. It is a common multiple, but it is not the least common multiple. Try It 1.17 Find the least common multiple by listing multiples: 9 and 12. Try It 1.18 Find the least common multiple by listing multiples: 18 and 24. Our second method to find the least common multiple of two numbers is to use The Prime Factors Method. Let’s find the LCM of 12 and 18 again, this time using their prime factors. Example 1.10 Find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of 12 and 18 using the prime factors method. Solution Notice that the prime factors of 12 (2·2·3)(2·2·3) and the prime factors of 18 (2·3·3)(2·3·3) are included in the LCM (2·2·3·3).(2·2·3·3). So 36 is the least common multiple of 12 and 18. (2·2·3)(2·2·3) (2·3·3)(2·3·3) (2·2·3·3).(2·2·3·3). By matching up the common primes, each common prime factor is used only once. This way you are sure that 36 is the least common multiple. Try It 1.19 Find the LCM using the prime factors method: 9 and 12. Try It 1.20 Find the LCM using the prime factors method: 18 and 24. How To Find the Least Common Multiple Using the Prime Factors Method. Step 1. Write each number as a product of primes. Step 2. List the primes of each number. Match primes vertically when possible. Step 3. Bring down the columns. Step 4. Multiply the factors. Example 1.11 Find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of 24 and 36 using the prime factors method. Solution Try It 1.21 Find the LCM using the prime factors method: 21 and 28. Try It 1.22 Find the LCM using the prime factors method: 24 and 32.

Page 3,"Suppose this year Greg is 20 years old and Alex is 23. You know that Alex is 3 years older than Greg. When Greg was 12, Alex was 15. When Greg is 35, Alex will be 38. No matter what Greg’s age is, Alex’s age will always be 3 years more, right? In the language of algebra, we say that Greg’s age and Alex’s age are variables and the 3 is a constant. The ages change (“vary”) but the 3 years between them always stays the same (“constant”). Since Greg’s age and Alex’s age will always differ by 3 years, 3 is the constant. variable constant In algebra, we use letters of the alphabet to represent variables. So if we call Greg’s age g, then we could use g+3g+3 to represent Alex’s age. See Table 1.2. g+3g+3 Table 1.2 The letters used to represent these changing ages are called variables. The letters most commonly used for variables are x, y, a, b, and c. Variable A variable is a letter that represents a number whose value may change. variable Constant A constant is a number whose value always stays the same. constant To write algebraically, we need some operation symbols as well as numbers and variables. There are several types of symbols we will be using. There are four basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. We’ll list the symbols used to indicate these operations in the table below. You’ll probably recognize some of them. operations addition subtraction multiplication division We perform these operations on two numbers. When translating from symbolic form to English, or from English to symbolic form, pay attention to the words “of” and “and.” In algebra, the cross symbol, ×,×, is not used to show multiplication because that symbol may cause confusion. Does 3xy mean 3×y3×y (‘three times y’) or 3·x·y3·x·y (three times x times y)? To make it clear, use ·· or parentheses for multiplication. ×,×, 3×y3×y 3·x·y3·x·y ·· When two quantities have the same value, we say they are equal and connect them with an equal sign. equal sign Equality Symbol a=ba=b is read “a is equal to b” a=ba=b The symbol “=”“=” is called the equal sign. “=”“=” On the number line, the numbers get larger as they go from left to right. The number line can be used to explain the symbols “<” and “>.” Inequality The expressions a < b or a > b can be read from left to right or right to left, though in English we usually read from left to right (Table 1.3). In general, a < b is equivalent to b > a. For example 7 < 11 is equivalent to 11 > 7. And a > b is equivalent to b < a. For example 17 > 4 is equivalent to 4 < 17.

They help to make clear which expressions are to be kept together and separate from other expressions. We will introduce three types now. Grouping Symbols Here are some examples of expressions that include grouping symbols. We will simplify expressions like these later in this section. grouping symbols What is the difference in English between a phrase and a sentence? A phrase expresses a single thought that is incomplete by itself, but a sentence makes a complete statement. “Running very fast” is a phrase, but “The football player was running very fast” is a sentence. A sentence has a subject and a verb. In algebra, we have expressions and equations. Expression An expression is a number, a variable, or a combination of numbers and variables using operation symbols. expression An expression is like an English phrase. Here are some examples of expressions: Notice that the English phrases do not form a complete sentence because the phrase does not have a verb. An equation is two expressions linked with an equal sign. When you read the words the symbols represent in an equation, you have a complete sentence in English. The equal sign gives the verb. equal sign Equation An equation is two expressions connected by an equal sign. equation Here are some examples of equations. Example 1.13 Determine if each is an expression or an equation: ⓐ 2(x+3)=102(x+3)=10 ⓑ 4(y−1)+14(y−1)+1 ⓒ x÷25x÷25 ⓓ y+8=40y+8=40 ⓐ 2(x+3)=102(x+3)=10 ⓑ 4(y−1)+14(y−1)+1 ⓒ x÷25x÷25 ⓓ y+8=40y+8=40 Solution ⓐ ⓑ ⓒ ⓓ Try It 1.25 Determine if each is an expression or an equation: ⓐ 3(x−7)=273(x−7)=27 ⓑ 5(4y−2)−75(4y−2)−7. ⓐ 3(x−7)=273(x−7)=27 ⓑ 5(4y−2)−75(4y−2)−7 Try It 1.26 Determine if each is an expression or an equation: ⓐ y3÷14y3÷14 ⓑ 4x−6=224x−6=22. ⓐ y3÷14y3÷14 ⓑ 4x−6=224x−6=22 Suppose we need to multiply 2 nine times. We could write this as 2·2·2·2·2·2·2·2·2.2·2·2·2·2·2·2·2·2. This is tedious and it can be hard to keep track of all those 2s, so we use exponents. We write 2·2·22·2·2 as 2323 and 2·2·2·2·2·2·2·2·22·2·2·2·2·2·2·2·2 as 29.29. In expressions such as 23,23, the 2 is called the base and the 3 is called the exponent. The exponent tells us how many times we need to multiply the base. 2·2·2·2·2·2·2·2·2.2·2·2·2·2·2·2·2·2. 2·2·22·2·2 2323 2·2·2·2·2·2·2·2·22·2·2·2·2·2·2·2·2 29.29. 23,23, We read 2323 as “two to the third power” or “two cubed.” 2323 We say 2323 is in exponential notation and 2·2·22·2·2 is in expanded notation. 2323 2·2·22·2·2 Exponential Notation anan means multiply a by itself, n times. anan The expression anan is read a to the nthnth power. anan nthnth While we read anan as “a to the nthnth power,” we usually read: anan nthnth We’ll see later why a2a2 and a3a3 have special names. a2a2 a3a3 Table 1.4 shows how we read some expressions with exponents.

Page 3,"To simplify an expression means to do all the math possible. For example, to simplify 4·2+14·2+1 we’d first multiply 4·24·2 to get 8 and then add the 1 to get 9. A good habit to develop is to work down the page, writing each step of the process below the previous step. The example just described would look like this: simplify an expression 4·2+14·2+1 4·24·2 By not using an equal sign when you simplify an expression, you may avoid confusing expressions with equations. equal sign Simplify an Expression To simplify an expression, do all operations in the expression. We’ve introduced most of the symbols and notation used in algebra, but now we need to clarify the order of operations. Otherwise, expressions may have different meanings, and they may result in different values. For example, consider the expression: If you simplify this expression, what do you get? Some students say 49, Others say 25, Imagine the confusion in our banking system if every problem had several different correct answers! The same expression should give the same result. So mathematicians early on established some guidelines that are called the Order of Operations. Order of Operations How To Perform the Order of Operations. Step 1. Step 2. Step 3. Step 4. Manipulative Mathematics Students often ask, “How will I remember the order?” Here is a way to help you remember: Take the first letter of each key word and substitute the silly phrase: “Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally.” It’s good that “My Dear” goes together, as this reminds us that multiplication and division have equal priority. We do not always do multiplication before division or always do division before multiplication. We do them in order from left to right. Similarly, “Aunt Sally” goes together and so reminds us that addition and subtraction also have equal priority and we do them in order from left to right. Let’s try an example. Example 1.15 Simplify: ⓐ 4+3·74+3·7 ⓑ (4+3)·7.(4+3)·7. ⓐ 4+3·74+3·7 ⓑ (4+3)·7.(4+3)·7. Solution ⓐ ⓐ ⓑ ⓑ Try It 1.29 Simplify: ⓐ 12−5·212−5·2 ⓑ (12−5)·2.(12−5)·2. ⓐ 12−5·212−5·2 ⓑ (12−5)·2.(12−5)·2.

When there are multiple grouping symbols, we simplify the innermost parentheses first and work outward. Example 1.17 Simplify: 5+23+3[6−3(4−2)].5+23+3[6−3(4−2)]. 5+23+3[6−3(4−2)].5+23+3[6−3(4−2)].

Page 3,"Algebraic expressions are made up of terms. A term is a constant, or the product of a constant and one or more variables.

The constant that multiplies the variable is called the coefficient. Coefficient The coefficient of a term is the constant that multiplies the variable in a term. coefficient Think of the coefficient as the number in front of the variable. The coefficient of the term 3x is 3. When we write x, the coefficient is 1, since x=1·x.x=1·x. x=1·x.x=1·x.

Page 3,"In the last section, we listed many operation symbols that are used in algebra, then we translated expressions and equations into English phrases and sentences. Now we’ll reverse the process. We’ll translate English phrases into algebraic expressions. The symbols and variables we’ve talked about will help us do that. Table 1.5 summarizes them.

Page 4,"Our work so far has only included the counting numbers and the whole numbers. But if you have ever experienced a temperature below zero or accidentally overdrawn your checking account, you are already familiar with negative numbers. Negative numbers are numbers less than 0.0. The negative numbers are to the left of zero on the number line. See Figure 1.6. 0.0. negative numbers Figure 1.6 The number line shows the location of positive and negative numbers. The arrows on the ends of the number line indicate that the numbers keep going forever. There is no biggest positive number, and there is no smallest negative number. Is zero a positive or a negative number? Numbers larger than zero are positive, and numbers smaller than zero are negative. Zero is neither positive nor negative. Consider how numbers are ordered on the number line. Going from left to right, the numbers increase in value. Going from right to left, the numbers decrease in value. See Figure 1.7. Figure 1.7 The numbers on a number line increase in value going from left to right and decrease in value going from right to left. Manipulative Mathematics Remember that we use the notation: a < b (read “a is less than b”) when a is to the left of b on the number line. a > b (read “a is greater than b”) when a is to the right of b on the number line. Now we need to extend the number line which showed the whole numbers to include negative numbers, too. The numbers marked by points in Figure 1.8 are called the integers. The integers are the numbers …−3,−2,−1,0,1,2,3……−3,−2,−1,0,1,2,3… …−3,−2,−1,0,1,2,3……−3,−2,−1,0,1,2,3… Figure 1.8 All the marked numbers are called integers.

You may have noticed that, on the number line, the negative numbers are a mirror image of the positive numbers, with zero in the middle. Because the numbers 2 and −2−2 are the same distance from zero, they are called opposites. The opposite of 2 is −2,−2, and the opposite of −2−2 is 2. number line −2−2 opposite −2,−2, −2−2 Opposite The opposite of a number is the number that is the same distance from zero on the number line but on the opposite side of zero. Figure 1.9 illustrates the definition. Figure 1.9 The opposite of 3 is −3.−3. Sometimes in algebra the same symbol has different meanings. Just like some words in English, the specific meaning becomes clear by looking at how it is used. You have seen the symbol “−” used in three different ways. Table 1.6 Opposite Notation −a−a means the opposite of the number a. −a−a The notation −a−a is read as “the opposite of a.” −a−a Example 1.31 Find: ⓐ the opposite of 7 ⓑ the opposite of −10−10 ⓒ −(−6).−(−6). ⓐ ⓑ −10−10 ⓒ −(−6).−(−6).

The integers are the numbers …−3,−2,−1,0,1,2,3……−3,−2,−1,0,1,2,3… integers …−3,−2,−1,0,1,2,3……−3,−2,−1,0,1,2,3… Integers The whole numbers and their opposites are called the integers. The integers are the numbers When evaluating the opposite of a variable, we must be very careful. Without knowing whether the variable represents a positive or negative number, we don’t know whether −x−x is positive or negative.

Page 4,"We saw that numbers such as 2and−22and−2 are opposites because they are the same distance from 0 on the number line. They are both two units from 0. The distance between 0 and any number on the number line is called the absolute value of that number. 2and−22and−2 Absolute Value The absolute value of a number is its distance from 0 on the number line. absolute value The absolute value of a number n is written as |n|.|n|. |n|.|n|. For example, Figure 1.10 illustrates this idea. Figure 1.10 The integers 5and are55and are5 units away from 0.0. The absolute value of a number is never negative (because distance cannot be negative). The only number with absolute value equal to zero is the number zero itself, because the distance from 0to00to0 on the number line is zero units. 0to00to0 Property of Absolute Value |n|≥0|n|≥0 for all numbers |n|≥0|n|≥0 Absolute values are always greater than or equal to zero!

Page 4,"Most students are comfortable with the addition and subtraction facts for positive numbers. But doing addition or subtraction with both positive and negative numbers may be more challenging. Manipulative Mathematics We will use two color counters to model addition and subtraction of negatives so that you can visualize the procedures instead of memorizing the rules. We let one color (blue) represent positive. The other color (red) will represent the negatives. If we have one positive counter and one negative counter, the value of the pair is zero. They form a neutral pair. The value of this neutral pair is zero. We will use the counters to show how to add the four addition facts using the numbers 5,−55,−5 and 3,−3.3,−3. 5,−55,−5 3,−3.3,−3. To add 5+3,5+3, we realize that 5+35+3 means the sum of 5 and 3. 5+3,5+3, 5+35+3 Now we will add −5+(−3).−5+(−3). Watch for similarities to the last example 5+3=8.5+3=8. −5+(−3).−5+(−3). 5+3=8.5+3=8. To add −5+(−3),−5+(−3), we realize this means the sum of −5and−3.−5and−3. −5+(−3),−5+(−3), −5and−3.−5and−3. In what ways were these first two examples similar? In each case we got 8—either 8 positives or 8 negatives. When the signs were the same, the counters were all the same color, and so we added them. Example 1.37 Add: ⓐ 1+41+4 ⓑ −1+(−4).−1+(−4). ⓐ 1+41+4 ⓑ −1+(−4).−1+(−4). Solution ⓐ ⓐ ⓑ ⓑ Try It 1.73 Add: ⓐ 2+42+4 ⓑ −2+(−4).−2+(−4). ⓐ 2+42+4 ⓑ −2+(−4).−2+(−4). Try It 1.74 Add: ⓐ 2+52+5 ⓑ −2+(−5).−2+(−5). ⓐ 2+52+5 ⓑ −2+(−5).−2+(−5). So what happens when the signs are different? Let’s add −5+3.−5+3. We realize this means the sum of −5−5 and 3. When the counters were the same color, we put them in a row. When the counters are a different color, we line them up under each other. −5+3.−5+3. −5−5 Notice that there were more negatives than positives, so the result was negative. Let’s now add the last combination, 5+(−3).5+(−3). 5+(−3).5+(−3). When we use counters to model addition of positive and negative integers, it is easy to see whether there are more positive or more negative counters. So we know whether the sum will be positive or negative. Example 1.38 Add: ⓐ −1+5−1+5 ⓑ 1+(−5).1+(−5). ⓐ −1+5−1+5 ⓑ 1+(−5).1+(−5). Solution ⓐ ⓐ ⓑ ⓑ Try It 1.75 Add: ⓐ −2+4−2+4 ⓑ 2+(−4).2+(−4). ⓐ −2+4−2+4 ⓑ 2+(−4).2+(−4). Try It 1.76 Add: ⓐ −2+5−2+5 ⓑ 2+(−5).2+(−5). ⓐ −2+5−2+5 ⓑ 2+(−5).2+(−5). Now that we have added small positive and negative integers with a model, we can visualize the model in our minds to simplify problems with any numbers. When you need to add numbers such as 37+(−53),37+(−53), you really don’t want to have to count out 37 blue counters and 53 red counters. With the model in your mind, can you visualize what you would do to solve the problem? 37+(−53),37+(−53), Picture 37 blue counters with 53 red counters lined up underneath. Since there would be more red (negative) counters than blue (positive) counters, the sum would be negative. How many more red counters would there be? Because 53−37=16,53−37=16, there are 16 more red counters. 53−37=16,53−37=16, Therefore, the sum of 37+(−53)37+(−53) is −16.−16. 37+(−53)37+(−53) −16.−16. Let’s try another one. We’ll add −74+(−27).−74+(−27). Again, imagine 74 red counters and 27 more red counters, so we’d have 101 red counters. This means the sum is −101.−101. −74+(−27).−74+(−27). −101.−101. Let’s look again at the results of adding the different combinations of 5,−55,−5 and 3,−3.3,−3. 5,−55,−5 3,−3.3,−3. Addition of Positive and Negative Integers When the signs are the same, the counters would be all the same color, so add them. When the signs are different, some of the counters would make neutral pairs, so subtract to see how many are left. Visualize the model as you simplify the expressions in the following examples. Example 1.39 Simplify: ⓐ 19+(−47)19+(−47) ⓑ −14+(−36).−14+(−36). ⓐ 19+(−47)19+(−47) ⓑ −14+(−36).−14+(−36).

The techniques used up to now extend to more complicated problems, like the ones we’ve seen before. Remember to follow the order of operations!

Page 4,"Manipulative Mathematics We will continue to use counters to model the subtraction. Remember, the blue counters represent positive numbers and the red counters represent negative numbers. Perhaps when you were younger, you read “5−3”“5−3” as “5“5 take away 3.”3.” When you use counters, you can think of subtraction the same way! “5−3”“5−3” “5“5 3.”3.” We will model the four subtraction facts using the numbers 55 and 3.3. 55 3.3. To subtract 5−3,5−3, we restate the problem as “5“5 take away 3.”3.” 5−3,5−3, “5“5 3.”3.” Now we will subtract −5−(−3).−5−(−3). Watch for similarities to the last example 5−3=2.5−3=2. −5−(−3).−5−(−3). 5−3=2.5−3=2. To subtract −5−(−3),−5−(−3), we restate this as “–5“–5 take away –3”–3” −5−(−3),−5−(−3), “–5“–5 –3”–3” Notice that these two examples are much alike: The first example, we subtract 3 positives from 5 positives and end up with 2 positives. In the second example, we subtract 3 negatives from 5 negatives and end up with 2 negatives. Each example used counters of only one color, and the “take away” model of subtraction was easy to apply. Example 1.41 Subtract: ⓐ 7−57−5 ⓑ −7−(−5).−7−(−5). ⓐ 7−57−5 ⓑ −7−(−5).−7−(−5). Solution ⓐ ⓑ Try It 1.81 Subtract: ⓐ 6−46−4 ⓑ −6−(−4).−6−(−4). ⓐ 6−46−4 ⓑ −6−(−4).−6−(−4). Try It 1.82 Subtract: ⓐ 7−47−4 ⓑ −7−(−4).−7−(−4). ⓐ 7−47−4 ⓑ −7−(−4).−7−(−4). What happens when we have to subtract one positive and one negative number? We’ll need to use both blue and red counters as well as some neutral pairs. Adding a neutral pair does not change the value. It is like changing quarters to nickels—the value is the same, but it looks different. neutral pairs We start with 5 negatives. We need to take away 3 positives, but we do not have any positives to take away. Remember, a neutral pair has value zero. If we add 0 to 5 its value is still 5. We add neutral pairs to the 5 negatives until we get 3 positives to take away. And now, the fourth case, 5−(−3).5−(−3). We start with 5 positives. We need to take away 3 negatives, but there are no negatives to take away. So we add neutral pairs until we have 3 negatives to take away. 5−(−3).5−(−3).

In Example 1.42, −3−1−3−1 is the same as −3+(−1)−3+(−1) and 3−(−1)3−(−1) is the same as 3+1.3+1. You will often see this idea, the subtraction property, written as follows: −3−1−3−1 −3+(−1)−3+(−1) 3−(−1)3−(−1) 3+1.3+1. subtraction property Subtraction Property Subtracting a number is the same as adding its opposite. Look at these two examples. Of course, when you have a subtraction problem that has only positive numbers, like 6−4,6−4, you just do the subtraction. You already knew how to subtract 6−46−4 long ago. But knowing that 6−46−4 gives the same answer as 6+(−4)6+(−4) helps when you are subtracting negative numbers. Make sure that you understand how 6−46−4 and 6+(−4)6+(−4) give the same results! 6−4,6−4, 6−46−4 6−46−4 6+(−4)6+(−4) 6−46−4 6+(−4)6+(−4) Example 1.43 Simplify: ⓐ 13−813−8 and 13+(−8)13+(−8) ⓑ −17−9−17−9 and −17+(−9).−17+(−9). ⓐ 13−813−8 13+(−8)13+(−8) ⓑ −17−9−17−9 −17+(−9).−17+(−9).

Subtracting a negative number is like adding a positive! You will often see this written as a−(−b)=a+b.a−(−b)=a+b. a−(−b)=a+b.a−(−b)=a+b. Does that work for other numbers, too? Let’s do the following example and see. Example 1.44 Simplify: ⓐ 9−(−15)9−(−15) and 9+159+15 ⓑ −7−(−4)−7−(−4) and −7+4.−7+4. ⓐ 9−(−15)9−(−15) 9+159+15 ⓑ −7−(−4)−7−(−4) −7+4.−7+4.

Let’s look again at the results of subtracting the different combinations of 5,−55,−5 and 3,−3.3,−3. 5,−55,−5 3,−3.3,−3. Subtraction of Integers When there would be enough counters of the color to take away, subtract. When there would be not enough counters of the color to take away, add. What happens when there are more than three integers? We just use the order of operations as usual. Example 1.45 Simplify: 7−(−4−3)−9.7−(−4−3)−9. 7−(−4−3)−9.7−(−4−3)−9.

Page 5,"Since multiplication is mathematical shorthand for repeated addition, our model can easily be applied to show multiplication of integers. Let’s look at this concrete model to see what patterns we notice. We will use the same examples that we used for addition and subtraction. Here, we will use the model just to help us discover the pattern. multiplication integers We remember that a·ba·b means add a, b times. a·ba·b The next two examples are more interesting. What does it mean to multiply 5 by −3?−3? It means subtract 5, 3 times. Looking at subtraction as “taking away,” it means to take away 5, 3 times. But there is nothing to take away, so we start by adding neutral pairs on the workspace. Then we take away 5 three times. −3?−3? In summary: Notice that for multiplication of two signed numbers, when the: We’ll put this all together in the chart below.

Example 1.58 Translate and simplify: the sum of 8 and −12,−12, increased by 3. −12,−12, Solution Table 1.16 Try It 1.115 Translate and simplify the sum of 9 and −16,−16, increased by 4. −16,−16, Try It 1.116 Translate and simplify the sum of −8−8 and −12,−12, increased by 7. −8−8 −12,−12, When we first introduced the operation symbols, we saw that the expression may be read in several ways. They are listed in the chart below. Be careful to get a and b in the right order! Example 1.59 Translate and then simplify ⓐ the difference of 13 and −21−21 ⓑ subtract 24 from −19.−19. ⓐ −21−21 ⓑ −19.−19. Solution ⓐ ⓑ Table 1.17 Try It 1.117 Translate and simplify ⓐ the difference of 14 and −23−23 ⓑ subtract 21 from −17.−17. ⓐ −23−23 ⓑ −17.−17. Try It 1.118 Translate and simplify ⓐ the difference of 11 and −19−19 ⓑ subtract 18 from −11.−11. ⓐ −19−19 ⓑ −11.−11. Once again, our prior work translating English to algebra transfers to phrases that include both multiplying and dividing integers. Remember that the key word for multiplication is “product” and for division is “quotient.” multiplication product division quotient Example 1.60 Translate to an algebraic expression and simplify if possible: the product of −2−2 and 14. −2−2 Solution Table 1.18 Try It 1.119 Translate to an algebraic expression and simplify if possible: the product of −5−5 and 12. −5−5 Try It 1.120 Translate to an algebraic expression and simplify if possible: the product of 8 and −13.−13. −13.−13. Example 1.61 Translate to an algebraic expression and simplify if possible: the quotient of −56−56 and −7.−7. −56−56 −7.−7. Solution Table 1.19 Try It 1.121 Translate to an algebraic expression and simplify if possible: the quotient of −63−63 and −9.−9. −63−63 −9.−9. Try It 1.122 Translate to an algebraic expression and simplify if possible: the quotient of −72−72 and −9.−9. −72−72 −9.−9."
Page 5,"We’ll outline a plan to solve applications. It’s hard to find something if we don’t know what we’re looking for or what to call it! So when we solve an application, we first need to determine what the problem is asking us to find. Then we’ll write a phrase that gives the information to find it. We’ll translate the phrase into an expression and then simplify the expression to get the answer. Finally, we summarize the answer in a sentence to make sure it makes sense. Example 1.62 In the morning, the temperature in Urbana, Illinois was 11 degrees. By mid-afternoon, the temperature had dropped to −9−9 degrees. What was the difference of the morning and afternoon temperatures? −9−9 Solution Try It 1.123 In the morning, the temperature in Anchorage, Alaska was 15 degrees. By mid-afternoon the temperature had dropped to 30 degrees below zero. What was the difference in the morning and afternoon temperatures? Try It 1.124 The temperature in Denver was −6−6 degrees at lunchtime. By sunset the temperature had dropped to −15−15 degrees. What was the difference in the lunchtime and sunset temperatures? −6−6 −15−15 How To Apply a Strategy to Solve Applications with Integers. Step 1. Read the problem. Make sure all the words and ideas are understood Step 2. Identify what we are asked to find. Step 3. Write a phrase that gives the information to find it. Step 4. Translate the phrase to an expression. Step 5. Simplify the expression. Step 6. Answer the question with a complete sentence. Example 1.63 The Mustangs football team received three penalties in the third quarter. Each penalty gave them a loss of fifteen yards. What is the number of yards lost? Solution Table 1.20 Try It 1.125 The Bears played poorly and had seven penalties in the game. Each penalty resulted in a loss of 15 yards. What is the number of yards lost due to penalties? Try It 1.126 Bill uses the ATM on campus because it is convenient. However, each time he uses it he is charged a $2 fee. Last month he used the ATM eight times. How much was his total fee for using the ATM?"

Page 6,"Fractions are a way to represent parts of a whole. The fraction 1313 means that one whole has been divided into 3 equal parts and each part is one of the three equal parts. See Figure 1.11. The fraction 2323 represents two of three equal parts. In the fraction 23,23, the 2 is called the numerator and the 3 is called the denominator. 1313 2323 23,23, numerator denominator Figure 1.11 The circle on the left has been divided into 3 equal parts. Each part is 1313 of the 3 equal parts. In the circle on the right, 2323 of the circle is shaded (2 of the 3 equal parts). Manipulative Mathematics Fraction A fraction is written ab,ab, where b≠0b≠0 and ab,ab, b≠0b≠0 A fraction represents parts of a whole. The denominator b is the number of equal parts the whole has been divided into, and the numerator a indicates how many parts are included. If a whole pie has been cut into 6 pieces and we eat all 6 pieces, we ate 6666 pieces, or, in other words, one whole pie. 6666 So 66=1.66=1. This leads us to the property of one that tells us that any number, except zero, divided by itself is 1. 66=1.66=1. Property of One Any number, except zero, divided by itself is one. Manipulative Mathematics If a pie was cut in 66 pieces and we ate all 6, we ate 6666 pieces, or, in other words, one whole pie. If the pie was cut into 8 pieces and we ate all 8, we ate 8888 pieces, or one whole pie. We ate the same amount—one whole pie. 66 6666 8888 The fractions 6666 and 8888 have the same value, 1, and so they are called equivalent fractions. Equivalent fractions are fractions that have the same value. 6666 8888 Let’s think of pizzas this time. Figure 1.12 shows two images: a single pizza on the left, cut into two equal pieces, and a second pizza of the same size, cut into eight pieces on the right. This is a way to show that 1212 is equivalent to 48.48. In other words, they are equivalent fractions. 1212 48.48. equivalent fractions Figure 1.12 Since the same amount is of each pizza is shaded, we see that 1212 is equivalent to 48.48. They are equivalent fractions. Equivalent Fractions Equivalent fractions are fractions that have the same value. How can we use mathematics to change 1212 into 48?48? How could we take a pizza that is cut into 2 pieces and cut it into 8 pieces? We could cut each of the 2 larger pieces into 4 smaller pieces! The whole pizza would then be cut into 88 pieces instead of just 2. Mathematically, what we’ve described could be written like this as 1·42·4=48.1·42·4=48. See Figure 1.13. 1212 48?48? 88 1·42·4=48.1·42·4=48. Figure 1.13 Cutting each half of the pizza into 44 pieces, gives us pizza cut into 8 pieces: 1·42·4=48.1·42·4=48. This model leads to the following property: Equivalent Fractions Property If a,b,ca,b,c are numbers where b≠0,c≠0,b≠0,c≠0, then a,b,ca,b,c b≠0,c≠0,b≠0,c≠0, If we had cut the pizza differently, we could get So, we say 12,24,36,and102012,24,36,and1020 are equivalent fractions. 12,24,36,and102012,24,36,and1020 Manipulative Mathematics Example 1.64 Find three fractions equivalent to 25.25. 25.25. Solution To find a fraction equivalent to 25,25, we multiply the numerator and denominator by the same number. We can choose any number, except for zero.

Page 6,"A fraction is considered simplified if there are no common factors, other than 1, in its numerator and denominator. For example, Simplified Fraction A fraction is considered simplified if there are no common factors in its numerator and denominator. simplified The phrase reduce a fraction means to simplify the fraction. We simplify, or reduce, a fraction by removing the common factors of the numerator and denominator. A fraction is not simplified until all common factors have been removed. If an expression has fractions, it is not completely simplified until the fractions are simplified. In Example 1.64, we used the equivalent fractions property to find equivalent fractions. Now we’ll use the equivalent fractions property in reverse to simplify fractions. We can rewrite the property to show both forms together. Equivalent Fractions Property If a,b,ca,b,c are numbers where b≠0,c≠0,b≠0,c≠0, a,b,ca,b,c b≠0,c≠0,b≠0,c≠0, Example 1.65 Simplify: −3256.−3256. −3256.−3256.

Try It 1.130 Simplify: −4581.−4581. −4581.−4581. Sometimes it may not be easy to find common factors of the numerator and denominator. When this happens, a good idea is to factor the numerator and the denominator into prime numbers. Then divide out the common factors using the equivalent fractions property. prime number Example 1.66 Simplify: −210385.−210385. −210385.−210385.

How To Simplify a Fraction. Step 1. Rewrite the numerator and denominator to show the common factors.
If needed, factor the numerator and denominator into prime numbers first. Step 2. Simplify using the equivalent fractions property by dividing out common factors. Step 3. Multiply any remaining factors, if needed. Example 1.67 Simplify: 5x5y.5x5y. 5x5y.5x5y. Solution Try It 1.133 Simplify: 7x7y.7x7y. 7x7y.7x7y. Try It 1.134 Simplify: 3a3b.3a3b. 3a3b.3a3b."
Page 6,"Many people find multiplying and dividing fractions easier than adding and subtracting fractions. So we will start with fraction multiplication. Manipulative Mathematics We’ll use a model to show you how to multiply two fractions and to help you remember the procedure. Let’s start with 34.34. 34.34. Now we’ll take 1212 of 34.34. 1212 34.34. Notice that now, the whole is divided into 8 equal parts. So 12·34=38.12·34=38. 12·34=38.12·34=38. To multiply fractions, we multiply the numerators and multiply the denominators. Fraction Multiplication If a,b,candda,b,candd are numbers where b≠0andd≠0,b≠0andd≠0, then a,b,candda,b,candd b≠0andd≠0,b≠0andd≠0, To multiply fractions, multiply the numerators and multiply the denominators. When multiplying fractions, the properties of positive and negative numbers still apply, of course. It is a good idea to determine the sign of the product as the first step. In Example 1.68, we will multiply negative and a positive, so the product will be negative. multiplying fractions product Example 1.68 Multiply: −1112·57.−1112·57. −1112·57.−1112·57. Solution The first step is to find the sign of the product. Since the signs are the different, the product is negative. Table 1.21 Try It 1.135 Multiply: −1028·815.−1028·815. −1028·815.−1028·815. Try It 1.136 Multiply: −920·512.−920·512. −920·512.−920·512. When multiplying a fraction by an integer, it may be helpful to write the integer as a fraction. Any integer, a, can be written as a1.a1. So, for example, 3=31.3=31. a1.a1. 3=31.3=31. Example 1.69 Multiply: −125(−20x).−125(−20x). −125(−20x).−125(−20x). Solution Determine the sign of the product.

Page 6,"Now that we know how to multiply fractions, we are almost ready to divide. Before we can do that, we need some vocabulary. The reciprocal of a fraction is found by inverting the fraction, placing the numerator in the denominator and the denominator in the numerator. The reciprocal of 2323 is 32.32. reciprocal 2323 32.32. Notice that 23·32=1.23·32=1. A number and its reciprocal multiply to 1. 23·32=1.23·32=1. To get a product of positive 1 when multiplying two numbers, the numbers must have the same sign. So reciprocals must have the same sign. product The reciprocal of −107−107 is −710,−710, since −107(−710)=1.−107(−710)=1. −107−107 −710,−710, −107(−710)=1.−107(−710)=1.

One way is to repeat the call outs to yourself. If you do this each time you do an exercise, you will have the steps memorized. Another way is to keep two examples in mind: The numerators or denominators of some fractions contain fractions themselves. A fraction in which the numerator or the denominator is a fraction is called a complex fraction. Complex Fraction A complex fraction is a fraction in which the numerator or the denominator contains a fraction. complex fraction Some examples of complex fractions are: To simplify a complex fraction, we remember that the fraction bar means division.

Page 7,"When we multiplied fractions, we just multiplied the numerators and multiplied the denominators right straight across. To add or subtract fractions, they must have a common denominator. Fraction Addition and Subtraction If a,b,andca,b,andc are numbers where c≠0,c≠0, then a,b,andca,b,andc c≠0,c≠0, To add or subtract fractions, add or subtract the numerators and place the result over the common denominator.

Page 7,"As we have seen, to add or subtract fractions, their denominators must be the same. The least common denominator (LCD) of two fractions is the smallest number that can be used as a common denominator of the fractions. The LCD of the two fractions is the least common multiple (LCM) of their denominators. least common denominator denominator Least Common Denominator The least common denominator (LCD) of two fractions is the least common multiple (LCM) of their denominators. Manipulative Mathematics After we find the least common denominator of two fractions, we convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with the LCD. Putting these steps together allows us to add and subtract fractions because their denominators will be the same! Example 1.81 Add: 712+518.712+518. 712+518.712+518. Solution Try It 1.161 Add: 712+1115.712+1115. 712+1115.712+1115. Try It 1.162 Add: 1315+1720.1315+1720. 1315+1720.1315+1720. How To Add or Subtract Fractions. Step 1. Step 2. Add or subtract the fractions. Step 3. Simplify, if possible. When finding the equivalent fractions needed to create the common denominators, there is a quick way to find the number we need to multiply both the numerator and denominator. This method works if we found the LCD by factoring into primes. Look at the factors of the LCD and then at each column above those factors. The “missing” factors of each denominator are the numbers we need. In Example 1.81, the LCD, 36, has two factors of 2 and two factors of 3.3. 3.3. The numerator 12 has two factors of 2 but only one of 3—so it is “missing” one 3—we multiply the numerator and denominator by 3. The numerator 18 is missing one factor of 2—so we multiply the numerator and denominator by 2. We will apply this method as we subtract the fractions in Example 1.82. Example 1.82 Subtract: 715−1924.715−1924. 715−1924.715−1924. Solution Do the fractions have a common denominator? No, so we need to find the LCD. Do not simplify the equivalent fractions! If you do, you’ll get back to the original fractions and lose the common denominator! Try It 1.163 Subtract: 1324−1732.1324−1732. 1324−1732.1324−1732. Try It 1.164 Subtract: 2132−928.2132−928. 2132−928.2132−928. In the next example, one of the fractions has a variable in its numerator. Notice that we do the same steps as when both numerators are numbers. Example 1.83 Add: 35+x8.35+x8. 35+x8.35+x8. Solution The fractions have different denominators. Remember, we can only add like terms: 24 and 5x are not like terms. Try It 1.165 Add: y6+79.y6+79. y6+79.y6+79. Try It 1.166 Add: x6+715.x6+715. x6+715.x6+715. We now have all four operations for fractions. Table 1.26 summarizes fraction operations. fraction operations Table 1.26 Example 1.84 Simplify: ⓐ 5x6−3105x6−310 ⓑ 5x6·310.5x6·310. ⓐ 5x6−3105x6−310 ⓑ 5x6·310.5x6·310. Solution First ask, “What is the operation?” Once we identify the operation that will determine whether we need a common denominator. Remember, we need a common denominator to add or subtract, but not to multiply or divide. ⓐ ⓑ Notice we needed an LCD to add 5x6−310,5x6−310, but not to multiply 5x6·310.5x6·310. 5x6−310,5x6−310, 5x6·310.5x6·310. Try It 1.167 Simplify: ⓐ 3a4−893a4−89 ⓑ 3a4·89.3a4·89. ⓐ 3a4−893a4−89 ⓑ 3a4·89.3a4·89. Try It 1.168 Simplify: ⓐ 4k5−164k5−16 ⓑ 4k5·16.4k5·16. ⓐ 4k5−164k5−16 ⓑ 4k5·16.4k5·16."
Page 7,We have seen that a complex fraction is a fraction in which the numerator or denominator contains a fraction. The fraction bar indicates division. We simplified the complex fraction 34583458 by dividing 3434 by 58.58. division 34583458 3434 58.58. Now we’ll look at complex fractions where the numerator or denominator contains an expression that can be simplified. So we first must completely simplify the numerator and denominator separately using the order of operations. Then we divide the numerator by the denominator. Example 1.85 Simplify: (12)24+32.(12)24+32. (12)24+32.(12)24+32. Solution Try It 1.169 Simplify: (13)223+2.(13)223+2. (13)223+2.(13)223+2. Try It 1.170 Simplify: 1+42(14)2.1+42(14)2. 1+42(14)2.1+42(14)2. How To Simplify Complex Fractions. Step 1. Simplify the numerator. Step 2. Simplify the denominator. Step 3. Divide the numerator by the denominator. Simplify if possible. Example 1.86 Simplify: 12+2334−16.12+2334−16. 12+2334−16.12+2334−16. Solution It may help to put parentheses around the numerator and the denominator. Table 1.27 Try It 1.171 Simplify: 13+1234−13.13+1234−13. 13+1234−13.13+1234−13. Try It 1.172 Simplify: 23−1214+13.23−1214+13. 23−1214+13.23−1214+13.
Page 7,"We have evaluated expressions before, but now we can evaluate expressions with fractions. Remember, to evaluate an expression, we substitute the value of the variable into the expression and then simplify. Example 1.87 Evaluate x+13x+13 when ⓐ x=−13x=−13 ⓑ x=−34.x=−34. x+13x+13 ⓐ x=−13x=−13 ⓑ x=−34.x=−34.

Page 8,"Decimals are another way of writing fractions whose denominators are powers of 10. fraction Notice that “ten thousand” is a number larger than one, but “one ten-thousandth” is a number smaller than one. The “th” at the end of the name tells you that the number is smaller than one. When we name a whole number, the name corresponds to the place value based on the powers of ten. We read 10,000 as “ten thousand” and 10,000,000 as “ten million.” Likewise, the names of the decimal places correspond to their fraction values. Figure 1.14 shows the names of the place values to the left and right of the decimal point. decimal place values Figure 1.14 Place value of decimal numbers are shown to the left and right of the decimal point. Example 1.91 Name the decimal 4.3. Solution Try It 1.181 Name the decimal: 6.7.6.7. 6.7.6.7. Try It 1.182 Name the decimal: 5.8.5.8. 5.8.5.8. We summarize the steps needed to name a decimal below. decimal How To Name a Decimal. Step 1. Name the number to the left of the decimal point. Step 2. Write “and” for the decimal point. Step 3. Name the “number” part to the right of the decimal point as if it were a whole number. Step 4. Name the decimal place of the last digit. Example 1.92 Name the decimal: −15.571.−15.571. −15.571.−15.571. Solution Try It 1.183 Name the decimal: −13.461.−13.461. −13.461.−13.461. Try It 1.184 Name the decimal: −2.053.−2.053. −2.053.−2.053. When we write a check we write both the numerals and the name of the number. Let’s see how to write the decimal from the name. Example 1.93 Write “fourteen and twenty-four thousandths” as a decimal. Solution Try It 1.185 Write as a decimal: thirteen and sixty-eight thousandths. Try It 1.186 Write as a decimal: five and ninety-four thousandths. We summarize the steps to writing a decimal. decimal How To Write a decimal. Step 1. Step 2. Mark the number of decimal places needed to the right of the decimal point by noting the place value indicated by the last word. Step 3. Translate the words after “and” into the number to the right of the decimal point. Write the number in the spaces—putting the final digit in the last place. Step 4. Fill in zeros for place holders as needed."

Page 8,"Multiplying decimals is very much like multiplying whole numbers—we just have to determine where to place the decimal point. The procedure for multiplying decimals will make sense if we first convert them to fractions and then multiply. So let’s see what we would get as the product of decimals by converting them to fractions first. We will do two examples side-by-side. Look for a pattern! product Notice, in the first example, we multiplied two numbers that each had one digit after the decimal point and the product had two decimal places. In the second example, we multiplied a number with one decimal place by a number with two decimal places and the product had three decimal places. We multiply the numbers just as we do whole numbers, temporarily ignoring the decimal point. We then count the number of decimal points in the factors and that sum tells us the number of decimal places in the product. The rules for multiplying positive and negative numbers apply to decimals, too, of course! When multiplying two numbers, When we multiply signed decimals, first we determine the sign of the product and then multiply as if the numbers were both positive. Finally, we write the product with the appropriate sign. How To Multiply Decimals. Step 1. Determine the sign of the product. Step 2. Write in vertical format, lining up the numbers on the right. Multiply the numbers as if they were whole numbers, temporarily ignoring the decimal points. Step 3. Place the decimal point. The number of decimal places in the product is the sum of the number of decimal places in the factors. Step 4. Write the product with the appropriate sign. Example 1.98 Multiply: (−3.9)(4.075).(−3.9)(4.075). (−3.9)(4.075).(−3.9)(4.075). Solution Try It 1.195 Multiply: −4.5(6.107).−4.5(6.107). −4.5(6.107).−4.5(6.107). Try It 1.196 Multiply: −10.79(8.12).−10.79(8.12). −10.79(8.12).−10.79(8.12). In many of your other classes, especially in the sciences, you will multiply decimals by powers of 10 (10, 100, 1000, etc.). If you multiply a few products on paper, you may notice a pattern relating the number of zeros in the power of 10 to number of decimal places we move the decimal point to the right to get the product. How To Multiply a Decimal by a Power of Ten. Step 1. Move the decimal point to the right the same number of places as the number of zeros in the power of 10. Step 2. Add zeros at the end of the number as needed. Example 1.99 Multiply 5.63 ⓐ by 10 ⓑ by 100 ⓒ by 1,000. ⓐ ⓑ ⓒ Solution By looking at the number of zeros in the multiple of ten, we see the number of places we need to move the decimal to the right. ⓐ ⓐ ⓑ ⓑ ⓒ ⓒ Try It 1.197 Multiply 2.58 ⓐ by 10 ⓑ by 100 ⓒ by 1,000. ⓐ ⓑ ⓒ Try It 1.198 Multiply 14.2 ⓐ by 10 ⓑ by 100 ⓒ by 1,000. ⓐ ⓑ ⓒ Just as with multiplication, division of decimals is very much like dividing whole numbers. We just have to figure out where the decimal point must be placed. division To divide decimals, determine what power of 10 to multiply the denominator by to make it a whole number. Then multiply the numerator by that same power of 10.10. Because of the equivalent fractions property, we haven’t changed the value of the fraction! The effect is to move the decimal points in the numerator and denominator the same number of places to the right. For example: 10.10. We use the rules for dividing positive and negative numbers with decimals, too. When dividing signed decimals, first determine the sign of the quotient and then divide as if the numbers were both positive. Finally, write the quotient with the appropriate sign. We review the notation and vocabulary for division: We’ll write the steps to take when dividing decimals, for easy reference. How To Divide Decimals. Step 1. Determine the sign of the quotient. Step 2. Make the divisor a whole number by “moving” the decimal point all the way to the right. “Move” the decimal point in the dividend the same number of places—adding zeros as needed. Step 3. Divide. Place the decimal point in the quotient above the decimal point in the dividend. Step 4. Write the quotient with the appropriate sign. Example 1.100 Divide: −25.65÷(−0.06).−25.65÷(−0.06). −25.65÷(−0.06).−25.65÷(−0.06). Solution Remember, you can “move” the decimals in the divisor and dividend because of the Equivalent Fractions Property. Try It 1.199 Divide: −23.492÷(−0.04).−23.492÷(−0.04). −23.492÷(−0.04).−23.492÷(−0.04). Try It 1.200 Divide: −4.11÷(−0.12).−4.11÷(−0.12). −4.11÷(−0.12).−4.11÷(−0.12). A common application of dividing whole numbers into decimals is when we want to find the price of one item that is sold as part of a multi-pack. For example, suppose a case of 24 water bottles costs $3.99. To find the price of one water bottle, we would divide $3.99 by 24. We show this division in Example 1.101. In calculations with money, we will round the answer to the nearest cent (hundredth). Example 1.101 Divide: $3.99÷24.$3.99÷24. $3.99÷24.$3.99÷24. Solution Try It 1.201 Divide: $6.99÷36.$6.99÷36. $6.99÷36.$6.99÷36. Try It 1.202 Divide: $4.99÷12.$4.99÷12. $4.99÷12.$4.99÷12."
Page 8,"We convert decimals into fractions by identifying the place value of the last (farthest right) digit. In the decimal 0.03 the 3 is in the hundredths place, so 100 is the denominator of the fraction equivalent to 0.03. Notice, when the number to the left of the decimal is zero, we get a fraction whose numerator is less than its denominator. Fractions like this are called proper fractions. proper fractions The steps to take to convert a decimal to a fraction are summarized in the procedure box. How To Convert a Decimal to a Proper Fraction. Step 1. Determine the place value of the final digit. Step 2. Example 1.102 Write 0.374 as a fraction. Solution Did you notice that the number of zeros in the denominator of 3741,0003741,000 is the same as the number of decimal places in 0.374? 3741,0003741,000 Try It 1.203 Write 0.234 as a fraction. Try It 1.204 Write 0.024 as a fraction. We’ve learned to convert decimals to fractions. Now we will do the reverse—convert fractions to decimals. Remember that the fraction bar means division. So 4545 can be written 4÷54÷5 or 54.54. This leads to the following method for converting a fraction to a decimal. 4545 4÷54÷5 54.54. How To Convert a Fraction to a Decimal. To convert a fraction to a decimal, divide the numerator of the fraction by the denominator of the fraction. Example 1.103 Write −58−58 as a decimal. −58−58 Solution Since a fraction bar means division, we begin by writing 5858 as 85.85. Now divide. 5858 85.85. Try It 1.205 Write −78−78 as a decimal. −78−78 Try It 1.206 Write −38−38 as a decimal. −38−38 When we divide, we will not always get a zero remainder. Sometimes the quotient ends up with a decimal that repeats. A repeating decimal is a decimal in which the last digit or group of digits repeats endlessly. A bar is placed over the repeating block of digits to indicate it repeats. repeating decimal Repeating Decimal A repeating decimal is a decimal in which the last digit or group of digits repeats endlessly. A bar is placed over the repeating block of digits to indicate it repeats. Example 1.104 Write 43224322 as a decimal. 43224322 Solution Try It 1.207 Write 27112711 as a decimal. 27112711 Try It 1.208 Write 51225122 as a decimal. 51225122 Sometimes we may have to simplify expressions with fractions and decimals together. Example 1.105 Simplify: 78+6.4.78+6.4. 78+6.4.78+6.4. Solution First we must change one number so both numbers are in the same form. We can change the fraction to a decimal, or change the decimal to a fraction. Usually it is easier to change the fraction to a decimal. Try It 1.209 Simplify: 38+4.9.38+4.9. 38+4.9.38+4.9. Try It 1.210 Simplify: 5.7+1320.5.7+1320. 5.7+1320.5.7+1320. A percent is a ratio whose denominator is 100. Percent means per hundred. We use the percent symbol, %, to show percent. Percent A percent is a ratio whose denominator is 100. percent Since a percent is a ratio, it can easily be expressed as a fraction. Percent means per 100, so the denominator of the fraction is 100. We then change the fraction to a decimal by dividing the numerator by the denominator. Table 1.30 Do you see the pattern? To convert a percent number to a decimal number, we move the decimal point two places to the left. Example 1.106 Convert each percent to a decimal: ⓐ 62% ⓑ 135% ⓒ 35.7%. ⓐ ⓑ ⓒ Solution ⓐ ⓑ ⓒ Try It 1.211 Convert each percent to a decimal: ⓐ 9%9% ⓑ 87%87% ⓒ 3.9%. ⓐ 9%9% ⓑ 87%87% ⓒ Try It 1.212 Convert each percent to a decimal: ⓐ 3% ⓑ 91% ⓒ 8.3%. ⓐ ⓑ ⓒ Converting a decimal to a percent makes sense if we remember the definition of percent and keep place value in mind. To convert a decimal to a percent, remember that percent means per hundred. If we change the decimal to a fraction whose denominator is 100, it is easy to change that fraction to a percent. Table 1.31 Recognize the pattern? To convert a decimal to a percent, we move the decimal point two places to the right and then add the percent sign.

Page 9,"Remember that when a number n is multiplied by itself, we write n2n2 and read it “n squared.” The result is called the square of n. For example, n2n2 square Similarly, 121 is the square of 11, because 112112 is 121. 112112 Square of a Number If n2=m,n2=m, then m is the square of n. n2=m,n2=m, Manipulative Mathematics Complete the following table to show the squares of the counting numbers 1 through 15. The numbers in the second row are called perfect square numbers. It will be helpful to learn to recognize the perfect square numbers. The squares of the counting numbers are positive numbers. What about the squares of negative numbers? We know that when the signs of two numbers are the same, their product is positive. So the square of any negative number is also positive. Did you notice that these squares are the same as the squares of the positive numbers? Sometimes we will need to look at the relationship between numbers and their squares in reverse. Because 102=100,102=100, we say 100 is the square of 10. We also say that 10 is a square root of 100. A number whose square is mm is called a square root of m. 102=100,102=100, mm square root Square Root of a Number If n2=m,n2=m, then n is a square root of m. n2=m,n2=m, Notice (−10)2=100(−10)2=100 also, so −10−10 is also a square root of 100. Therefore, both 10 and −10−10 are square roots of 100. (−10)2=100(−10)2=100 −10−10 −10−10 So, every positive number has two square roots—one positive and one negative. What if we only wanted the positive square root of a positive number? The radical sign, m,m, denotes the positive square root. The positive square root is called the principal square root. When we use the radical sign that always means we want the principal square root. radical sign m,m, principal square root We also use the radical sign for the square root of zero. Because 02=0,02=0, 0=0.0=0. Notice that zero has only one square root. 02=0,02=0, 0=0.0=0. Square Root Notation mm is read “the square root of m” mm If m=n2,m=n2, then m=n,m=n, for n≥0.n≥0. m=n2,m=n2, m=n,m=n, n≥0.n≥0. The square root of m, m,m, is the positive number whose square is m. m,m, Since 10 is the principal square root of 100, we write 100=10.100=10. You may want to complete the following table to help you recognize square roots. 100=10.100=10. Example 1.108 Simplify: ⓐ 2525 ⓑ 121.121. ⓐ 2525 ⓑ 121.121.

We know that every positive number has two square roots and the radical sign indicates the positive one. We write 100=10.100=10. If we want to find the negative square root of a number, we place a negative in front of the radical sign. For example, −100=−10.−100=−10. We read −100−100 as “the opposite of the square root of 10.” 100=10.100=10. −100=−10.−100=−10. −100−100 Example 1.109 Simplify: ⓐ −9−9 ⓑ −144.−144. ⓐ −9−9 ⓑ −144.−144.

Page 9,"We have already described numbers as counting numbers, whole numbers, and integers. What is the difference between these types of numbers? counting numbers whole numbers integers What type of numbers would we get if we started with all the integers and then included all the fractions? The numbers we would have form the set of rational numbers. A rational number is a number that can be written as a ratio of two integers. rational number Rational Number A rational number is a number of the form pq,pq, where p and q are integers and q≠0.q≠0. pq,pq, q≠0.q≠0. A rational number can be written as the ratio of two integers. All signed fractions, such as 45,−78,134,−20345,−78,134,−203 are rational numbers. Each numerator and each denominator is an integer. 45,−78,134,−20345,−78,134,−203 Are integers rational numbers? To decide if an integer is a rational number, we try to write it as a ratio of two integers. Each integer can be written as a ratio of integers in many ways. For example, 3 is equivalent to 31,62,93,124,155…31,62,93,124,155… 31,62,93,124,155…31,62,93,124,155… An easy way to write an integer as a ratio of integers is to write it as a fraction with denominator one. Since any integer can be written as the ratio of two integers, all integers are rational numbers! Remember that the counting numbers and the whole numbers are also integers, and so they, too, are rational. What about decimals? Are they rational? Let’s look at a few to see if we can write each of them as the ratio of two integers. We’ve already seen that integers are rational numbers. The integer −8−8 could be written as the decimal −8.0.−8.0. So, clearly, some decimals are rational. −8−8 −8.0.−8.0. Think about the decimal 7.3. Can we write it as a ratio of two integers? Because 7.3 means 7310,7310, we can write it as an improper fraction, 7310.7310. So 7.3 is the ratio of the integers 73 and 10. It is a rational number. 7310,7310, 7310.7310. In general, any decimal that ends after a number of digits (such as 7.3 or −1.2684)−1.2684) is a rational number. We can use the reciprocal (or multiplicative inverse) of the place value of the last digit as the denominator when writing the decimal as a fraction. −1.2684)−1.2684) Example 1.110 Write as the ratio of two integers: ⓐ −27−27 ⓑ 7.31. ⓐ −27−27 ⓑ Solution ⓐ ⓑ Table 1.34 So we see that −27−27 and 7.31 are both rational numbers, since they can be written as the ratio of two integers. −27−27 Try It 1.219 Write as the ratio of two integers: ⓐ −24−24 ⓑ 3.57. ⓐ −24−24 ⓑ Try It 1.220 Write as the ratio of two integers: ⓐ −19−19 ⓑ 8.41. ⓐ −19−19 ⓑ Let’s look at the decimal form of the numbers we know are rational. We have seen that every integer is a rational number, since a=a1a=a1 for any integer, a. We can also change any integer to a decimal by adding a decimal point and a zero. a=a1a=a1 We have also seen that every fraction is a rational number. Look at the decimal form of the fractions we considered above. What do these examples tell us? Every rational number can be written both as a ratio of integers, (pq,(pq, where p and q are integers and q≠0),q≠0), and as a decimal that either stops or repeats. (pq,(pq, q≠0),q≠0), Here are the numbers we looked at above expressed as a ratio of integers and as a decimal: Rational Number A rational number is a number of the form pq,pq, where p and q are integers and q≠0.q≠0. pq,pq, q≠0.q≠0. Its decimal form stops or repeats. Are there any decimals that do not stop or repeat? Yes! The number ππ (the Greek letter pi, pronounced “pie”), which is very important in describing circles, has a decimal form that does not stop or repeat. ππ We can even create a decimal pattern that does not stop or repeat, such as Numbers whose decimal form does not stop or repeat cannot be written as a fraction of integers. We call these numbers irrational. Irrational Number An irrational number is a number that cannot be written as the ratio of two integers. irrational number Its decimal form does not stop and does not repeat. Let’s summarize a method we can use to determine whether a number is rational or irrational. Rational or Irrational?

We have seen that all counting numbers are whole numbers, all whole numbers are integers, and all integers are rational numbers. The irrational numbers are numbers whose decimal form does not stop and does not repeat. When we put together the rational numbers and the irrational numbers, we get the set of real numbers. real number Real Number A real number is a number that is either rational or irrational. All the numbers we use in elementary algebra are real numbers. Figure 1.15 illustrates how the number sets we’ve discussed in this section fit together. Figure 1.15 This chart shows the number sets that make up the set of real numbers. Does the term “real numbers” seem strange to you? Are there any numbers that are not “real,” and, if so, what could they be? Can we simplify −25?−25? Is there a number whose square is −25?−25? −25?−25? −25?−25? None of the numbers that we have dealt with so far has a square that is −25.−25. Why? Any positive number squared is positive. Any negative number squared is positive. So we say there is no real number equal to −25.−25. −25.−25. −25.−25. The square root of a negative number is not a real number.

Page 9,"The last time we looked at the number line, it only had positive and negative integers on it. We now want to include fractions and decimals on it. number line fraction Manipulative Mathematics Let’s start with fractions and locate 15,−45,3,74,−92,−5,and8315,−45,3,74,−92,−5,and83 on the number line. 15,−45,3,74,−92,−5,and8315,−45,3,74,−92,−5,and83 We’ll start with the whole numbers 33 and −5.−5. because they are the easiest to plot. See Figure 1.16. 33 −5.−5. The proper fractions listed are 15and−45.15and−45. We know the proper fraction 1515 has value less than one and so would be located between 0 and 1.0 and 1. The denominator is 5, so we divide the unit from 0 to 1 into 5 equal parts 15,25,35,45.15,25,35,45. We plot 15.15. See Figure 1.16. proper fractions 15and−45.15and−45. 1515 0 and 1.0 and 1. 15,25,35,45.15,25,35,45. 15.15. Similarly, −45−45 is between 0 and −1.−1. After dividing the unit into 5 equal parts we plot −45.−45. See Figure 1.16. −45−45 −1.−1. −45.−45. Finally, look at the improper fractions 74,−92,83.74,−92,83. These are fractions in which the numerator is greater than the denominator. Locating these points may be easier if you change each of them to a mixed number.

Page 9,"Since decimals are forms of fractions, locating decimals on the number line is similar to locating fractions on the number line. Example 1.117 Locate 0.4 on the number line. Solution A proper fraction has value less than one. The decimal number 0.4 is equivalent to 410,410, a proper fraction, so 0.4 is located between 0 and 1. On a number line, divide the interval between 0 and 1 into 10 equal parts. Now label the parts 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0. We write 0 as 0.0 and 1 and 1.0, so that the numbers are consistently in tenths. Finally, mark 0.4 on the number line. See Figure 1.18. 410,410, Figure 1.18 Try It 1.233 Locate on the number line: 0.6. Try It 1.234 Locate on the number line: 0.9. Example 1.118 Locate −0.74−0.74 on the number line. −0.74−0.74 Solution The decimal −0.74−0.74 is equivalent to −74100,−74100, so it is located between 0 and −1.−1. On a number line, mark off and label the hundredths in the interval between 0 and −1.−1. See Figure 1.19. −0.74−0.74 −74100,−74100, −1.−1. −1.−1. Figure 1.19 Try It 1.235 Locate on the number line: −0.6.−0.6. −0.6.−0.6. Try It 1.236 Locate on the number line: −0.7.−0.7. −0.7.−0.7. Which is larger, 0.04 or 0.40? If you think of this as money, you know that $0.40 (forty cents) is greater than $0.04 (four cents). So, 0.40>0.040.40>0.04 0.40>0.040.40>0.04 Again, we can use the number line to order numbers. Where are 0.04 and 0.40 located on the number line? See Figure 1.20. Figure 1.20 We see that 0.40 is to the right of 0.04 on the number line. This is another way to demonstrate that 0.40 > 0.04. How does 0.31 compare to 0.308? This doesn’t translate into money to make it easy to compare. But if we convert 0.31 and 0.308 into fractions, we can tell which is larger. Because 310 > 308, we know that 3101000>3081000.3101000>3081000. Therefore, 0.31 > 0.308. 3101000>3081000.3101000>3081000. Notice what we did in converting 0.31 to a fraction—we started with the fraction 3110031100 and ended with the equivalent fraction 3101000.3101000. Converting 31010003101000 back to a decimal gives 0.310. So 0.31 is equivalent to 0.310. Writing zeros at the end of a decimal does not change its value! 3110031100 3101000.3101000. 31010003101000 We say 0.31 and 0.310 are equivalent decimals. equivalent decimals Equivalent Decimals Two decimals are equivalent if they convert to equivalent fractions. We use equivalent decimals when we order decimals. The steps we take to order decimals are summarized here. How To Order Decimals. Step 1. Write the numbers one under the other, lining up the decimal points. Step 2. Check to see if both numbers have the same number of digits. If not, write zeros at the end of the one with fewer digits to make them match. Step 3. Compare the numbers as if they were whole numbers. Step 4. Order the numbers using the appropriate inequality sign. Example 1.119 Order 0.64___0.60.64___0.6 using << or >.>. 0.64___0.60.64___0.6 << >.>.

When we order negative decimals, it is important to remember how to order negative integers. Recall that larger numbers are to the right on the number line. For example, because −2−2 lies to the right of −3−3 on the number line, we know that −2>−3.−2>−3. Similarly, smaller numbers lie to the left on the number line. For example, because −9−9 lies to the left of −6−6 on the number line, we know that −9<−6.−9<−6. See Figure 1.21. −2−2 −3−3 −2>−3.−2>−3. −9−9 −6−6 −9<−6.−9<−6. Figure 1.21 If we zoomed in on the interval between 0 and −1,−1, as shown in Example 1.121, we would see in the same way that −0.2>−0.3and−0.9<−0.6.−0.2>−0.3and−0.9<−0.6. −1,−1, −0.2>−0.3and−0.9<−0.6.−0.2>−0.3and−0.9<−0.6.

Page 10,"Think about adding two numbers, say 5 and 3. The order we add them doesn’t affect the result, does it? The results are the same. As we can see, the order in which we add does not matter! What about multiplying 5and3?5and3? 5and3?5and3? Again, the results are the same! The order in which we multiply does not matter! These examples illustrate the commutative property. When adding or multiplying, changing the order gives the same result. commutative property Commutative Property When adding or multiplying, changing the order gives the same result. The commutative property has to do with order. If you change the order of the numbers when adding or multiplying, the result is the same. What about subtraction? Does order matter when we subtract numbers? Does 7−37−3 give the same result as 3−7?3−7? 7−37−3 3−7?3−7? The results are not the same. Since changing the order of the subtraction did not give the same result, we know that subtraction is not commutative. Let’s see what happens when we divide two numbers. Is division commutative? division The results are not the same. Since changing the order of the division did not give the same result, division is not commutative. The commutative properties only apply to addition and multiplication! If you were asked to simplify this expression, how would you do it and what would your answer be? Some people would think 7+8is157+8is15 and then 15+2is17.15+2is17. Others might start with 8+2makes108+2makes10 and then 7+10makes17.7+10makes17. 7+8is157+8is15 15+2is17.15+2is17. 8+2makes108+2makes10 7+10makes17.7+10makes17. Either way gives the same result. Remember, we use parentheses as grouping symbols to indicate which operation should be done first. Table 1.40 When adding three numbers, changing the grouping of the numbers gives the same result. This is true for multiplication, too. Table 1.41 When multiplying three numbers, changing the grouping of the numbers gives the same result. You probably know this, but the terminology may be new to you. These examples illustrate the associative property. associative property Associative Property When adding or multiplying, changing the grouping gives the same result. Let’s think again about multiplying 5·13·3.5·13·3. We got the same result both ways, but which way was easier? Multiplying 1313 and 33 first, as shown above on the right side, eliminates the fraction in the first step. Using the associative property can make the math easier! 5·13·3.5·13·3. 1313 33 The associative property has to do with grouping. If we change how the numbers are grouped, the result will be the same. Notice it is the same three numbers in the same order—the only difference is the grouping. associative property We saw that subtraction and division were not commutative. They are not associative either. When simplifying an expression, it is always a good idea to plan what the steps will be. In order to combine like terms in the next example, we will use the commutative property of addition to write the like terms together. Example 1.122 Simplify: 18p+6q+15p+5q.18p+6q+15p+5q. 18p+6q+15p+5q.18p+6q+15p+5q. Solution Table 1.42 Try It 1.243 Simplify: 23r+14s+9r+15s.23r+14s+9r+15s. 23r+14s+9r+15s.23r+14s+9r+15s.

When we have to simplify algebraic expressions, we can often make the work easier by applying the commutative or associative property first, instead of automatically following the order of operations. When adding or subtracting fractions, combine those with a common denominator first. expression Example 1.123 Simplify: (513+34)+14.(513+34)+14. (513+34)+14.(513+34)+14.

Page 10,"What happens when we add 0 to any number? Adding 0 doesn’t change the value. For this reason, we call 0 the additive identity. additive identity For example, These examples illustrate the Identity Property of Addition that states that for any real number a,a, a+0=aa+0=a and 0+a=a.0+a=a. Identity Property of Addition a,a, a+0=aa+0=a 0+a=a.0+a=a. What happens when we multiply any number by one? Multiplying by 1 doesn’t change the value. So we call 1 the multiplicative identity. multiplicative identity For example, These examples illustrate the Identity Property of Multiplication that states that for any real number a,a, a·1=aa·1=a and 1·a=a.1·a=a. Identity Property of Multiplication a,a, a·1=aa·1=a 1·a=a.1·a=a. We summarize the Identity Properties below. Identity Property Notice that in each case, the missing number was the opposite of the number! We call −a.−a. the additive inverse of a. The opposite of a number is its additive inverse. A number and its opposite add to zero, which is the additive identity. This leads to the Inverse Property of Addition that states for any real number a,a+(−a)=0.a,a+(−a)=0.

In other words, 2323 times what results in 1? 2323 2323 What number multiplied by 2 gives the multiplicative identity, 1? In other words 2 times what results in 1? Notice that in each case, the missing number was the reciprocal of the number! reciprocal We call 1a1a the multiplicative inverse of a. The reciprocal of aa number is its multiplicative inverse. A number and its reciprocal multiply to one, which is the multiplicative identity. This leads to the Inverse Property of Multiplication that states that for any real number a,a≠0,a·1a=1.a,a≠0,a·1a=1. 1a1a multiplicative inverse aa Inverse Property of Multiplication a,a≠0,a·1a=1.a,a≠0,a·1a=1.

Page 10,"The identity property of addition says that when we add 0 to any number, the result is that same number. What happens when we multiply a number by 0? Multiplying by 0 makes the product equal zero. product Multiplication by Zero For any real number a. The product of any real number and 0 is 0. What about division involving zero? What is 0÷3?0÷3? Think about a real example: If there are no cookies in the cookie jar and 3 people are to share them, how many cookies does each person get? There are no cookies to share, so each person gets 0 cookies. So, division 0÷3?0÷3? We can check division with the related multiplication fact. So we know 0÷3=00÷3=0 because 0·3=0.0·3=0. 0÷3=00÷3=0 0·3=0.0·3=0. Division of Zero For any real number a, except 0,0, 0a=00a=0 and 0÷a=0.0÷a=0. 0,0, 0a=00a=0 0÷a=0.0÷a=0. Zero divided by any real number except zero is zero. Now think about dividing by zero. What is the result of dividing 4 by 0? Think about the related multiplication fact: 4÷0=?4÷0=? means ?·0=4.?·0=4. Is there a number that multiplied by 0 gives 4? Since any real number multiplied by 0 gives 0, there is no real number that can be multiplied by 0 to obtain 4. 4÷0=?4÷0=? ?·0=4.?·0=4. We conclude that there is no answer to 4÷04÷0 and so we say that division by 0 is undefined. 4÷04÷0 Division by Zero For any real number a, except 0, a0a0 and a÷0a÷0 are undefined. a0a0 a÷0a÷0 Division by zero is undefined.

Before multiplying left to right, look for reciprocals—their product is 1. Example 1.130 Simplify: 715·823·157.715·823·157. 715·823·157.715·823·157.

Page 10,"Suppose that three friends are going to the movies. They each need $9.25—that’s 9 dollars and 1 quarter—to pay for their tickets. How much money do they need all together? You can think about the dollars separately from the quarters. They need 3 times $9 so $27, and 3 times 1 quarter, so 75 cents. In total, they need $27.75. If you think about doing the math in this way, you are using the distributive property. Distributive Property Back to our friends at the movies, we could find the total amount of money they need like this: In algebra, we use the distributive property to remove parentheses as we simplify expressions. distributive property For example, if we are asked to simplify the expression 3(x+4),3(x+4), the order of operations says to work in the parentheses first. But we cannot add x and 4, since they are not like terms. So we use the distributive property, as shown in Example 1.132. 3(x+4),3(x+4), Example 1.132 Simplify: 3(x+4).3(x+4). 3(x+4).3(x+4). Solution Table 1.53 Try It 1.263 Simplify: 4(x+2).4(x+2). 4(x+2).4(x+2). Try It 1.264 Simplify: 6(x+7).6(x+7). 6(x+7).6(x+7). Some students find it helpful to draw in arrows to remind them how to use the distributive property. Then the first step in Example 1.132 would look like this: Example 1.133 Simplify: 8(38x+14).8(38x+14). 8(38x+14).8(38x+14). Solution Try It 1.265 Simplify: 6(56y+12).6(56y+12). 6(56y+12).6(56y+12). Try It 1.266 Simplify: 12(13n+34).12(13n+34). 12(13n+34).12(13n+34). Using the distributive property as shown in Example 1.134 will be very useful when we solve money applications in later chapters. Example 1.134 Simplify: 100(0.3+0.25q).100(0.3+0.25q). 100(0.3+0.25q).100(0.3+0.25q). Solution Try It 1.267 Simplify: 100(0.7+0.15p).100(0.7+0.15p). 100(0.7+0.15p).100(0.7+0.15p).

Example 1.135 Simplify: −2(4y+1).−2(4y+1). −2(4y+1).−2(4y+1). Solution Try It 1.269 Simplify: −3(6m+5).−3(6m+5). −3(6m+5).−3(6m+5). Try It 1.270 Simplify: −6(8n+11).−6(8n+11). −6(8n+11).−6(8n+11). Example 1.136 Simplify: −11(4−3a).−11(4−3a). −11(4−3a).−11(4−3a). Solution Notice that you could also write the result as 33a−44.33a−44. Do you know why? 33a−44.33a−44. Try It 1.271 Simplify: −5(2−3a).−5(2−3a). −5(2−3a).−5(2−3a). Try It 1.272 Simplify: −7(8−15y).−7(8−15y). −7(8−15y).−7(8−15y). Example 1.137 will show how to use the distributive property to find the opposite of an expression. Example 1.137 Simplify: −(y+5).−(y+5). −(y+5).−(y+5). Solution Table 1.54 Try It 1.273 Simplify: −(z−11).−(z−11). −(z−11).−(z−11). Try It 1.274 Simplify: −(x−4).−(x−4). −(x−4).−(x−4). There will be times when we’ll need to use the distributive property as part of the order of operations. Start by looking at the parentheses. If the expression inside the parentheses cannot be simplified, the next step would be multiply using the distributive property, which removes the parentheses. The next two examples will illustrate this. distributive property Example 1.138 Simplify: 8−2(x+3).8−2(x+3). 8−2(x+3).8−2(x+3). Be sure to follow the order of operations. Multiplication comes before subtraction, so we will distribute the 2 first and then subtract. Solution Table 1.55 Try It 1.275 Simplify: 9−3(x+2).9−3(x+2). 9−3(x+2).9−3(x+2). Try It 1.276 Simplify: 7x−5(x+4).7x−5(x+4). 7x−5(x+4).7x−5(x+4). Example 1.139 Simplify: 4(x−8)−(x+3).4(x−8)−(x+3). 4(x−8)−(x+3).4(x−8)−(x+3).

Page 11,"There are two systems of measurement commonly used around the world. Most countries use the metric system. The U.S. uses a different system of measurement, usually called the U.S. system. We will look at the U.S. system first. U.S. system The U.S. system of measurement uses units of inch, foot, yard, and mile to measure length and pound and ton to measure weight. For capacity, the units used are cup, pint, quart, and gallons. Both the U.S. system and the metric system measure time in seconds, minutes, and hours. The equivalencies of measurements are shown in Table 1.58. The table also shows, in parentheses, the common abbreviations for each measurement. Table 1.58 In many real-life applications, we need to convert between units of measurement, such as feet and yards, minutes and seconds, quarts and gallons, etc. We will use the identity property of multiplication to do these conversions. We’ll restate the identity property of multiplication here for easy reference. Identity Property of Multiplication For any real numbera:a·1=a1·a=a1is themultiplicative identityFor any real numbera:a·1=a1·a=a1is themultiplicative identity For any real numbera:a·1=a1·a=a1is themultiplicative identityFor any real numbera:a·1=a1·a=a1is themultiplicative identity To use the identity property of multiplication, we write 1 in a form that will help us convert the units. For example, suppose we want to change inches to feet. We know that 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, so we will write 1 as the fraction 1foot12inches.1foot12inches. When we multiply by this fraction we do not change the value, but just change the units. 1foot12inches.1foot12inches. But 12inches1foot12inches1foot also equals 1. How do we decide whether to multiply by 1foot12inches1foot12inches or 12inches1foot?12inches1foot? We choose the fraction that will make the units we want to convert from divide out. Treat the unit words like factors and “divide out” common units like we do common factors. If we want to convert 6666 inches to feet, which multiplication will eliminate the inches? 12inches1foot12inches1foot 1foot12inches1foot12inches 12inches1foot?12inches1foot? factors 6666 The inches divide out and leave only feet. The second form does not have any units that will divide out and so will not help us. Example 1.140 MaryAnne is 66 inches tall. Convert her height into feet. Solution Try It 1.279 Lexie is 30 inches tall. Convert her height to feet. Try It 1.280 Rene bought a hose that is 18 yards long. Convert the length to feet. How To Make Unit Conversions. Step 1. Multiply the measurement to be converted by 1; write 1 as a fraction relating the units given and the units needed. Step 2. Multiply. Step 3. Simplify the fraction. Step 4. Simplify. When we use the identity property of multiplication to convert units, we need to make sure the units we want to change from will divide out. Usually this means we want the conversion fraction to have those units in the denominator. Example 1.141 Ndula, an elephant at the San Diego Safari Park, weighs almost 3.2 tons. Convert her weight to pounds. Solution We will convert 3.2 tons into pounds. We will use the identity property of multiplication, writing 1 as the fraction 2000pounds1ton.2000pounds1ton. 2000pounds1ton.2000pounds1ton. Try It 1.281 Arnold’s SUV weighs about 4.3 tons. Convert the weight to pounds. Try It 1.282 The Carnival Destiny cruise ship weighs 51,000 tons. Convert the weight to pounds. Sometimes, to convert from one unit to another, we may need to use several other units in between, so we will need to multiply several fractions. Example 1.142 Juliet is going with her family to their summer home. She will be away from her boyfriend for 9 weeks. Convert the time to minutes. Solution To convert weeks into minutes we will convert weeks into days, days into hours, and then hours into minutes. To do this we will multiply by conversion factors of 1. Juliet and her boyfriend will be apart for 90,720 minutes (although it may seem like an eternity!). Try It 1.283 The distance between the earth and the moon is about 250,000 miles. Convert this length to yards. Try It 1.284 The astronauts of Expedition 28 on the International Space Station spend 15 weeks in space. Convert the time to minutes. Example 1.143 How many ounces are in 1 gallon? Solution We will convert gallons to ounces by multiplying by several conversion factors. Refer to Table 1.58. Try It 1.285 How many cups are in 1 gallon? Try It 1.286 How many teaspoons are in 1 cup?"
Page 11,Solution
Page 11,"We often use mixed units of measurement in everyday situations. Suppose Joe is 5 feet 10 inches tall, stays at work for 7 hours and 45 minutes, and then eats a 1 pound 2 ounce steak for dinner—all these measurements have mixed units. Performing arithmetic operations on measurements with mixed units of measures requires care. Be sure to add or subtract like units! Example 1.144 Seymour bought three steaks for a barbecue. Their weights were 14 ounces, 1 pound 2 ounces and 1 pound 6 ounces. How many total pounds of steak did he buy? Solution We will add the weights of the steaks to find the total weight of the steaks. Try It 1.287 Laura gave birth to triplets weighing 3 pounds 3 ounces, 3 pounds 3 ounces, and 2 pounds 9 ounces. What was the total birth weight of the three babies? Try It 1.288 Stan cut two pieces of crown molding for his family room that were 8 feet 7 inches and 12 feet 11 inches. What was the total length of the molding? Example 1.145 Anthony bought four planks of wood that were each 6 feet 4 inches long. What is the total length of the wood he purchased? Solution We will multiply the length of one plank to find the total length. Try It 1.289 Henri wants to triple his spaghetti sauce recipe that uses 1 pound 8 ounces of ground turkey. How many pounds of ground turkey will he need? Try It 1.290 Joellen wants to double a solution of 5 gallons 3 quarts. How many gallons of solution will she have in all?"
Page 11,"In the metric system, units are related by powers of 10. The roots words of their names reflect this relation. For example, the basic unit for measuring length is a meter. One kilometer is 1,000 meters; the prefix kilo means thousand. One centimeter is 11001100 of a meter, just like one cent is 11001100 of one dollar. metric system 11001100 11001100 The equivalencies of measurements in the metric system are shown in Table 1.59. The common abbreviations for each measurement are given in parentheses. Table 1.59 To make conversions in the metric system, we will use the same technique we did in the US system. Using the identity property of multiplication, we will multiply by a conversion factor of one to get to the correct units. Have you ever run a 5K or 10K race? The length of those races are measured in kilometers. The metric system is commonly used in the United States when talking about the length of a race. Example 1.146 Nick ran a 10K race. How many meters did he run? Solution We will convert kilometers to meters using the identity property of multiplication. Try It 1.291 Sandy completed her first 5K race! How many meters did she run? Try It 1.292 Herman bought a rug 2.5 meters in length. How many centimeters is the length? Example 1.147 Eleanor’s newborn baby weighed 3,200 grams. How many kilograms did the baby weigh? Solution We will convert grams into kilograms. Try It 1.293 Kari’s newborn baby weighed 2,800 grams. How many kilograms did the baby weigh? Try It 1.294 Anderson received a package that was marked 4,500 grams. How many kilograms did this package weigh? As you become familiar with the metric system you may see a pattern. Since the system is based on multiples of ten, the calculations involve multiplying by multiples of ten. We have learned how to simplify these calculations by just moving the decimal. To multiply by 10, 100, or 1,000, we move the decimal to the right one, two, or three places, respectively. To multiply by 0.1, 0.01, or 0.001, we move the decimal to the left one, two, or three places, respectively. We can apply this pattern when we make measurement conversions in the metric system. In Example 1.147, we changed 3,200 grams to kilograms by multiplying by 1100011000 (or 0.001). This is the same as moving the decimal three places to the left. 1100011000 Example 1.148 Convert ⓐ 350 L to kiloliters ⓑ 4.1 L to milliliters. ⓐ ⓑ Solution ⓐ ⓑ Try It 1.295 Convert: ⓐ 725 L to kiloliters ⓑ 6.3 L to milliliters ⓐ ⓑ Try It 1.296 Convert: ⓐ 350 hL to liters ⓑ 4.1 L to centiliters ⓐ ⓑ"
Page 11,"Performing arithmetic operations on measurements with mixed units of measures in the metric system requires the same care we used in the US system. But it may be easier because of the relation of the units to the powers of 10. Make sure to add or subtract like units. Example 1.149 Ryland is 1.6 meters tall. His younger brother is 85 centimeters tall. How much taller is Ryland than his younger brother? Solution We can convert both measurements to either centimeters or meters. Since meters is the larger unit, we will subtract the lengths in meters. We convert 85 centimeters to meters by moving the decimal 2 places to the left. Table 1.60 Ryland is 0.75 m0.75 m taller than his brother. 0.75 m0.75 m Try It 1.297 Mariella is 1.58 meters tall. Her daughter is 75 centimeters tall. How much taller is Mariella than her daughter? Write the answer in centimeters. Try It 1.298 The fence around Hank’s yard is 2 meters high. Hank is 96 centimeters tall. How much shorter than the fence is Hank? Write the answer in meters. Example 1.150 Dena’s recipe for lentil soup calls for 150 milliliters of olive oil. Dena wants to triple the recipe. How many liters of olive oil will she need? Solution We will find the amount of olive oil in millileters then convert to liters. Table 1.61 Try It 1.299 A recipe for Alfredo sauce calls for 250 milliliters of milk. Renata is making pasta with Alfredo sauce for a big party and needs to multiply the recipe amounts by 8. How many liters of milk will she need? Try It 1.300 To make one pan of baklava, Dorothea needs 400 grams of filo pastry. If Dorothea plans to make 6 pans of baklava, how many kilograms of filo pastry will she need?"
Page 11,"Many measurements in the United States are made in metric units. Our soda may come in 2-liter bottles, our calcium may come in 500-mg capsules, and we may run a 5K race. To work easily in both systems, we need to be able to convert between the two systems. Table 1.62 shows some of the most common conversions. Table 1.62 Figure 1.22 shows how inches and centimeters are related on a ruler. Figure 1.22 This ruler shows inches and centimeters. Figure 1.23 shows the ounce and milliliter markings on a measuring cup. Figure 1.23 This measuring cup shows ounces and milliliters. Figure 1.24 shows how pounds and kilograms marked on a bathroom scale. Figure 1.24 This scale shows pounds and kilograms. We make conversions between the systems just as we do within the systems—by multiplying by unit conversion factors. Example 1.151 Lee’s water bottle holds 500 mL of water. How many ounces are in the bottle? Round to the nearest tenth of an ounce. Solution Table 1.63 Try It 1.301 How many quarts of soda are in a 2-L bottle? Try It 1.302 How many liters are in 4 quarts of milk? Example 1.152 Soleil was on a road trip and saw a sign that said the next rest stop was in 100 kilometers. How many miles until the next rest stop? Solution Table 1.64 Try It 1.303 The height of Mount Kilimanjaro is 5,895 meters. Convert the height to feet. Try It 1.304 The flight distance from New York City to London is 5,586 kilometers. Convert the distance to miles."
Page 11,"Have you ever been in a foreign country and heard the weather forecast? If the forecast is for 22°C,22°C, what does that mean? 22°C,22°C, The U.S. and metric systems use different scales to measure temperature. The U.S. system uses degrees Fahrenheit, written °F.°F. The metric system uses degrees Celsius, written °C.°C. Figure 1.25 shows the relationship between the two systems. °F.°F. °C.°C. Figure 1.25 The diagram shows normal body temperature, along with the freezing and boiling temperatures of water in degrees Fahrenheit and degrees Celsius.

Page 13,"1.1 Introduction to Whole Numbers Step 1. Start at the left and name the number in each period, followed by the period name. Step 2. Put commas in the number to separate the periods. Step 3. Do not name the ones period. Step 1. Identify the words that indicate periods. (Remember the ones period is never named.) Step 2. Draw 3 blanks to indicate the number of places needed in each period. Separate the periods by commas. Step 3. Name the number in each period and place the digits in the correct place value position. Step 1. Locate the given place value and mark it with an arrow. All digits to the left of the arrow do not change. Step 2. Underline the digit to the right of the given place value. Step 3. Step 4. Replace all digits to the right of the given place value with zeros. Step 1. Find two factors whose product is the given number, and use these numbers to create two branches. Step 2. If a factor is prime, that branch is complete. Circle the prime, like a bud on the tree. Step 3. If a factor is not prime, write it as the product of two factors and continue the process. Step 4. Write the composite number as the product of all the circled primes. Step 1. List several multiples of each number. Step 2. Look for the smallest number that appears on both lists. Step 3. This number is the LCM. Step 1. Write each number as a product of primes. Step 2. List the primes of each number. Match primes vertically when possible. Step 3. Bring down the columns. Step 4. Multiply the factors."
Page 13,"1.2 Use the Language of Algebra Step 1. Parentheses and other Grouping Symbols: Simplify all expressions inside the parentheses or other grouping symbols, working on the innermost parentheses first. Step 2. Exponents: Simplify all expressions with exponents. Step 3. Multiplication and Division: Perform all multiplication and division in order from left to right. These operations have equal priority. Step 4. Addition and Subtraction: Perform all addition and subtraction in order from left to right. These operations have equal priority. Step 1. Identify like terms. Step 2. Rearrange the expression so like terms are together. Step 3. Add or subtract the coefficients and keep the same variable for each group of like terms."
Page 13,1.3 Add and Subtract Integers
Page 13,1.4 Multiply and Divide Integers Step 1. Identify what you are asked to find. Step 2. Write a phrase that gives the information to find it. Step 3. Translate the phrase to an expression. Step 4. Simplify the expression. Step 5. Answer the question with a complete sentence.
Page 13,"1.5 Visualize Fractions Step 1. Rewrite the numerator and denominator to show the common factors. If needed, factor the numerator and denominator into prime numbers first. Step 2. Simplify using the equivalent fractions property by dividing out common factors. Step 3. Multiply any remaining factors. Step 1. Simplify the expression in the numerator. Simplify the expression in the denominator. Step 2. Simplify the fraction."
Page 13,"1.6 Add and Subtract Fractions Step 1. Do they have a common denominator?
Yes—go to step 2.
No—Rewrite each fraction with the LCD (Least Common Denominator). Find the LCD. Change each fraction into an equivalent fraction with the LCD as its denominator. Step 2. Add or subtract the fractions. Step 3. Simplify, if possible. To multiply or divide fractions, an LCD IS NOT needed. To add or subtract fractions, an LCD IS needed. Step 1. Simplify the numerator. Step 2. Simplify the denominator. Step 3. Divide the numerator by the denominator. Simplify if possible."
Page 13,"1.7 Decimals Step 1. Name the number to the left of the decimal point. Step 2. Write ”and” for the decimal point. Step 3. Name the “number” part to the right of the decimal point as if it were a whole number. Step 4. Name the decimal place of the last digit. Step 1. Look for the word ‘and’—it locates the decimal point. Place a decimal point under the word ‘and.’ Translate the words before ‘and’ into the whole number and place it to the left of the decimal point. If there is no “and,” write a “0” with a decimal point to its right. Step 2. Mark the number of decimal places needed to the right of the decimal point by noting the place value indicated by the last word. Step 3. Translate the words after ‘and’ into the number to the right of the decimal point. Write the number in the spaces—putting the final digit in the last place. Step 4. Fill in zeros for place holders as needed. Step 1. Locate the given place value and mark it with an arrow. Step 2. Underline the digit to the right of the place value. Step 3. Is this digit greater than or equal to 5? Yes—add 1 to the digit in the given place value. No—do not change the digit in the given place value. Step 4. Rewrite the number, deleting all digits to the right of the rounding digit. Step 1. Write the numbers so the decimal points line up vertically. Step 2. Use zeros as place holders, as needed. Step 3. Add or subtract the numbers as if they were whole numbers. Then place the decimal in the answer under the decimal points in the given numbers. Step 1. Determine the sign of the product. Step 2. Write in vertical format, lining up the numbers on the right. Multiply the numbers as if they were whole numbers, temporarily ignoring the decimal points. Step 3. Place the decimal point. The number of decimal places in the product is the sum of the decimal places in the factors. Step 4. Write the product with the appropriate sign. Step 1. Move the decimal point to the right the same number of places as the number of zeros in the power of 10. Step 2. Add zeros at the end of the number as needed. Step 1. Determine the sign of the quotient. Step 2. Make the divisor a whole number by “moving” the decimal point all the way to the right. “Move” the decimal point in the dividend the same number of places - adding zeros as needed. Step 3. Divide. Place the decimal point in the quotient above the decimal point in the dividend. Step 4. Write the quotient with the appropriate sign. Step 1. Determine the place value of the final digit. Step 2. Write the fraction: numerator—the ‘numbers’ to the right of the decimal point; denominator—the place value corresponding to the final digit."
Page 13,"1.8 The Real Numbers Step 1. Write the numbers one under the other, lining up the decimal points. Step 2. Check to see if both numbers have the same number of digits. If not, write zeros at the end of the one with fewer digits to make them match. Step 3. Compare the numbers as if they were whole numbers. Step 4. Order the numbers using the appropriate inequality sign."

Page 17,"Solving an equation is like discovering the answer to a puzzle. The purpose in solving an equation is to find the value or values of the variable that make each side of the equation the same – so that we end up with a true statement. Any value of the variable that makes the equation true is called a solution to the equation. It is the answer to the puzzle! Solution of an equation A solution of an equation is a value of a variable that makes a true statement when substituted into the equation. solution of an equation How To To determine whether a number is a solution to an equation. Step 1. Substitute the number in for the variable in the equation. Step 2. Simplify the expressions on both sides of the equation. Step 3. Example 2.1 Determine whether x=32x=32 is a solution of 4x−2=2x+14x−2=2x+1. x=32x=32 4x−2=2x+14x−2=2x+1 Solution Since a solution to an equation is a value of the variable that makes the equation true, begin by substituting the value of the solution for the variable. Since x=32x=32 results in a true equation (4 is in fact equal to 4), 3232 is a solution to the equation 4x−2=2x+14x−2=2x+1. x=32x=32 3232 4x−2=2x+14x−2=2x+1 Try It 2.1 Is y=43y=43 a solution of 9y+2=6y+39y+2=6y+3? y=43y=43 9y+2=6y+39y+2=6y+3 Try It 2.2 Is y=75y=75 a solution of 5y+3=10y−45y+3=10y−4? y=75y=75 5y+3=10y−45y+3=10y−4"

Page 17,"We are going to use a model to clarify the process of solving an equation. An envelope represents the variable – since its contents are unknown – and each counter represents one. We will set out one envelope and some counters on our workspace, as shown in Figure 2.2. Both sides of the workspace have the same number of counters, but some counters are “hidden” in the envelope. Can you tell how many counters are in the envelope? Figure 2.2 The illustration shows a model of an equation with one variable. On the left side of the workspace is an unknown (envelope) and three counters, while on the right side of the workspace are eight counters. What are you thinking? What steps are you taking in your mind to figure out how many counters are in the envelope? Perhaps you are thinking: “I need to remove the 3 counters at the bottom left to get the envelope by itself. The 3 counters on the left can be matched with 3 on the right and so I can take them away from both sides. That leaves five on the right—so there must be 5 counters in the envelope.” See Figure 2.3 for an illustration of this process. Figure 2.3 The illustration shows a model for solving an equation with one variable. On both sides of the workspace remove three counters, leaving only the unknown (envelope) and five counters on the right side. The unknown is equal to five counters. What algebraic equation would match this situation? In Figure 2.4 each side of the workspace represents an expression and the center line takes the place of the equal sign. We will call the contents of the envelope xx. xx Figure 2.4 The illustration shows a model for the equation x+3=8x+3=8. Let’s write algebraically the steps we took to discover how many counters were in the envelope: Check: Five in the envelope plus three more does equal eight! Our model has given us an idea of what we need to do to solve one kind of equation. The goal is to isolate the variable by itself on one side of the equation. To solve equations such as these mathematically, we use the Subtraction Property of Equality. Subtraction Property of Equality Subtraction Property of Equality For any numbers a, b, and c, When you subtract the same quantity from both sides of an equation, you still have equality. Manipulative Mathematics Subtraction Property of Equality Let’s see how to use this property to solve an equation. Remember, the goal is to isolate the variable on one side of the equation. And we check our solutions by substituting the value into the equation to make sure we have a true statement. Example 2.2 Solve: y+37=−13.y+37=−13. y+37=−13.y+37=−13. Solution To get y by itself, we will undo the addition of 37 by using the Subtraction Property of Equality. Since y=−50y=−50 makes y+37=−13y+37=−13 a true statement, we have the solution to this equation. y=−50y=−50 y+37=−13y+37=−13 Try It 2.3 Solve: x+19=−27x+19=−27. x+19=−27x+19=−27 Try It 2.4 Solve: x+16=−34x+16=−34. x+16=−34x+16=−34 What happens when an equation has a number subtracted from the variable, as in the equation x−5=8x−5=8? We use another property of equations to solve equations where a number is subtracted from the variable. We want to isolate the variable, so to ‘undo’ the subtraction we will add the number to both sides. We use the Addition Property of Equality. x−5=8x−5=8 Addition Property of Equality Addition Property of Equality For any numbers a, b, and c, When you add the same quantity to both sides of an equation, you still have equality. In Example 2.2, 37 was added to the y and so we subtracted 37 to ‘undo’ the addition. In Example 2.3, we will need to ‘undo’ subtraction by using the Addition Property of Equality. Addition Property of Equality Example 2.3 Solve: a−28=−37.a−28=−37. a−28=−37.a−28=−37. Solution Try It 2.5 Solve: n−61=−75.n−61=−75. n−61=−75.n−61=−75.

Page 17,"In the previous examples, we were able to isolate the variable with just one operation. Most of the equations we encounter in algebra will take more steps to solve. Usually, we will need to simplify one or both sides of an equation before using the Subtraction or Addition Properties of Equality. You should always simplify as much as possible before you try to isolate the variable. Remember that to simplify an expression means to do all the operations in the expression. Simplify one side of the equation at a time. Note that simplification is different from the process used to solve an equation in which we apply an operation to both sides. simplification Example 2.6 Solve: 9x−5−8x−6=7.9x−5−8x−6=7. 9x−5−8x−6=7.9x−5−8x−6=7.

Page 17,"Most of the time a question that requires an algebraic solution comes out of a real life question. To begin with that question is asked in English (or the language of the person asking) and not in math symbols. Because of this, it is an important skill to be able to translate an everyday situation into algebraic language. We will start by restating the problem in just one sentence, assign a variable, and then translate the sentence into an equation to solve. When assigning a variable, choose a letter that reminds you of what you are looking for. For example, you might use q for the number of quarters if you were solving a problem about coins. Example 2.11 The MacIntyre family recycled newspapers for two months. The two months of newspapers weighed a total of 57 pounds. The second month, the newspapers weighed 28 pounds. How much did the newspapers weigh the first month? Solution Try It 2.21 Translate into an algebraic equation and solve: The Pappas family has two cats, Zeus and Athena. Together, they weigh 23 pounds. Zeus weighs 16 pounds. How much does Athena weigh? Try It 2.22 Translate into an algebraic equation and solve: Sam and Henry are roommates. Together, they have 68 books. Sam has 26 books. How many books does Henry have? How To Solve an application. Step 1. Read the problem. Make sure all the words and ideas are understood. Step 2. Identify what we are looking for. Step 3. Name what we are looking for. Choose a variable to represent that quantity. Step 4. Translate into an equation. It may be helpful to restate the problem in one sentence with the important information. Step 5. Solve the equation using good algebra techniques. Step 6. Check the answer in the problem and make sure it makes sense. Step 7. Answer the question with a complete sentence. Example 2.12 Randell paid $28,675 for his new car. This was $875 less than the sticker price. What was the sticker price of the car? Solution Table 2.2 Try It 2.23 Translate into an algebraic equation and solve: Eddie paid $19,875 for his new car. This was $1,025 less than the sticker price. What was the sticker price of the car?

Congratulations! You have achieved your goals in this section! Reflect on the study skills you used so that you can continue to use them. What did you do to become confident of your ability to do these things? Be specific! …with some help. This must be addressed quickly as topics you do not master become potholes in your road to success. Math is sequential - every topic builds upon previous work. It is important to make sure you have a strong foundation before you move on. Whom can you ask for help? Your fellow classmates and instructor are good resources. Is there a place on campus where math tutors are available? Can your study skills be improved? …no - I don’t get it! This is critical and you must not ignore it. You need to get help immediately or you will quickly be overwhelmed. See your instructor as soon as possible to discuss your situation. Together you can come up with a plan to get you the help you need."

You have achieved your goals in this section! Reflect on the study skills you used so that you can continue to use them. What did you do to become confident of your ability to do these things? Be specific! …with some help. This must be addressed quickly as topics you do not master become potholes in your road to success. Math is sequential - every topic builds upon previous work. It is important to make sure you have a strong foundation before you move on. Whom can you ask for help? Your fellow classmates and instructor are good resources. Is there a place on campus where math tutors are available? Can your study skills be improved? …no - I don’t get it! This is critical and you must not ignore it. You need to get help immediately or you will quickly be overwhelmed. See your instructor as soon as possible to discuss your situation. Together you can come up with a plan to get you the help you need."

Page 18,"You may have noticed that all of the equations we have solved so far have been of the form x+a=bx+a=b or x−a=bx−a=b. We were able to isolate the variable by adding or subtracting the constant term on the side of the equation with the variable. Now we will see how to solve equations that have a variable multiplied by a constant and so will require division to isolate the variable. x+a=bx+a=b x−a=bx−a=b Let’s look at our puzzle again with the envelopes and counters in Figure 2.5. Figure 2.5 The illustration shows a model of an equation with one variable multiplied by a constant. On the left side of the workspace are two instances of the unknown (envelope), while on the right side of the workspace are six counters. In the illustration there are two identical envelopes that contain the same number of counters. Remember, the left side of the workspace must equal the right side, but the counters on the left side are “hidden” in the envelopes. So how many counters are in each envelope? How do we determine the number? We have to separate the counters on the right side into two groups of the same size to correspond with the two envelopes on the left side. The 6 counters divided into 2 equal groups gives 3 counters in each group (since 6÷2=36÷2=3). 6÷2=36÷2=3 What equation models the situation shown in Figure 2.6? There are two envelopes, and each contains xx counters. Together, the two envelopes must contain a total of 6 counters. xx Figure 2.6 The illustration shows a model of the equation 2x=62x=6. We found that each envelope contains 3 counters. Does this check? We know 2·3=62·3=6, so it works! Three counters in each of two envelopes does equal six! 2·3=62·3=6 This example leads to the Division Property of Equality. Division Property of Equality The Division Property of Equality For any numbers a, b, and c, and c≠0c≠0, c≠0c≠0 When you divide both sides of an equation by any non-zero number, you still have equality. Manipulative Mathematics Division Property of Equality The goal in solving an equation is to ‘undo’ the operation on the variable. In the next example, the variable is multiplied by 5, so we will divide both sides by 5 to ‘undo’ the multiplication. Example 2.13 Solve: 5x=−27.5x=−27. 5x=−27.5x=−27. Solution Try It 2.25 Solve: 3y=−41.3y=−41. 3y=−41.3y=−41. Try It 2.26 Solve: 4z=−55.4z=−55. 4z=−55.4z=−55. Consider the equation x4=3x4=3. We want to know what number divided by 4 gives 3. So to “undo” the division, we will need to multiply by 4. The Multiplication Property of Equality will allow us to do this. This property says that if we start with two equal quantities and multiply both by the same number, the results are equal. x4=3x4=3 Multiplication Property of Equality The Multiplication Property of Equality For any numbers a, b, and c, If you multiply both sides of an equation by the same number, you still have equality. Example 2.14 Solve: y−7=−14.y−7=−14. y−7=−14.y−7=−14. Solution Here yy is divided by −7−7. We must multiply by −7−7 to isolate yy. yy −7−7 −7−7 yy Try It 2.27 Solve: a−7=−42.a−7=−42. a−7=−42.a−7=−42. Try It 2.28 Solve: b−6=−24.b−6=−24. b−6=−24.b−6=−24. Example 2.15 Solve: −n=9.−n=9. −n=9.−n=9. Solution Try It 2.29 Solve: −k=8.−k=8. −k=8.−k=8. Try It 2.30 Solve: −g=3.−g=3. −g=3.−g=3. Example 2.16 Solve: 34x=12.34x=12. 34x=12.34x=12. Solution Since the product of a number and its reciprocal is 1, our strategy will be to isolate xx by multiplying by the reciprocal of 3434. xx 3434 Try It 2.31 Solve: 25n=14.25n=14. 25n=14.25n=14. Try It 2.32 Solve: 56y=15.56y=15. 56y=15.56y=15. In the next example, all the variable terms are on the right side of the equation. As always, our goal in solving the equation is to isolate the variable. Example 2.17 Solve: 815=−45x.815=−45x. 815=−45x.815=−45x. Solution Try It 2.33 Solve: 925=−45z.925=−45z. 925=−45z.925=−45z. Try It 2.34 Solve: 56=−83r.56=−83r. 56=−83r.56=−83r."

Page 18,"Many equations start out more complicated than the ones we have been working with. With these more complicated equations the first step is to simplify both sides of the equation as much as possible. This usually involves combining like terms or using the distributive property. Example 2.18 Solve: 14−23=12y−4y−5y.14−23=12y−4y−5y. 14−23=12y−4y−5y.14−23=12y−4y−5y. Solution Begin by simplifying each side of the equation. Try It 2.35 Solve: 18−27=15c−9c−3c.18−27=15c−9c−3c. 18−27=15c−9c−3c.18−27=15c−9c−3c. Try It 2.36 Solve:18−22=12x−x−4x.18−22=12x−x−4x. 18−22=12x−x−4x.18−22=12x−x−4x. Example 2.19 Solve: −4(a−3)−7=25.−4(a−3)−7=25. −4(a−3)−7=25.−4(a−3)−7=25. Solution Here we will simplify each side of the equation by using the distributive property first.

Page 19,"In all the equations we have solved so far, all the variable terms were on only one side of the equation with the constants on the other side. This does not happen all the time—so now we will learn to solve equations in which the variable terms, or constant terms, or both are on both sides of the equation. Our strategy will involve choosing one side of the equation to be the “variable side”, and the other side of the equation to be the “constant side.” Then, we will use the Subtraction and Addition Properties of Equality to get all the variable terms together on one side of the equation and the constant terms together on the other side. By doing this, we will transform the equation that began with variables and constants on both sides into the form ax=b.ax=b. We already know how to solve equations of this form by using the Division or Multiplication Properties of Equality. ax=b.ax=b. Example 2.27 Solve: 7x+8=−13.7x+8=−13. 7x+8=−13.7x+8=−13. Solution In this equation, the variable is found only on the left side. It makes sense to call the left side the “variable” side. Therefore, the right side will be the “constant” side. We will write the labels above the equation to help us remember what goes where. Since the left side is the “xx”, or variable side, the 8 is out of place. We must “undo” adding 8 by subtracting 8, and to keep the equality we must subtract 8 from both sides. xx Try It 2.53 Solve: 3x+4=−8.3x+4=−8. 3x+4=−8.3x+4=−8. Try It 2.54 Solve: 5a+3=−37.5a+3=−37. 5a+3=−37.5a+3=−37. Example 2.28 Solve: 8y−9=31.8y−9=31. 8y−9=31.8y−9=31. Solution Notice, the variable is only on the left side of the equation, so we will call this side the “variable” side, and the right side will be the “constant” side. Since the left side is the “variable” side, the 9 is out of place. It is subtracted from the 8y8y, so to “undo” subtraction, add 9 to both sides. Remember, whatever you do to the left, you must do to the right. 8y8y Try It 2.55 Solve: 5y−9=16.5y−9=16. 5y−9=16.5y−9=16. Try It 2.56 Solve: 3m−8=19.3m−8=19. 3m−8=19.3m−8=19."
Page 19,"Solution In this equation, the variable is found only on the left side. It makes sense to call the left side the “variable” side. Therefore, the right side will be the “constant” side. We will write the labels above the equation to help us remember what goes where. Since the left side is the “xx”, or variable side, the 8 is out of place. We must “undo” adding 8 by subtracting 8, and to keep the equality we must subtract 8 from both sides. xx"
Page 19,"What if there are variables on both sides of the equation? For equations like this, begin as we did above—choose a “variable” side and a “constant” side, and then use the subtraction and addition properties of equality to collect all variables on one side and all constants on the other side. variables Example 2.29 Solve: 9x=8x−6.9x=8x−6. 9x=8x−6.9x=8x−6. Solution Here the variable is on both sides, but the constants only appear on the right side, so let’s make the right side the “constant” side. Then the left side will be the “variable” side. Try It 2.57 Solve: 6n=5n−10.6n=5n−10. 6n=5n−10.6n=5n−10. Try It 2.58 Solve: −6c=−7c−1.−6c=−7c−1. −6c=−7c−1.−6c=−7c−1. Example 2.30 Solve: 5y−9=8y.5y−9=8y. 5y−9=8y.5y−9=8y. Solution The only constant is on the left and the yy’s are on both sides. Let’s leave the constant on the left and get the variables to the right. yy Try It 2.59 Solve: 3p−14=5p.3p−14=5p. 3p−14=5p.3p−14=5p. Try It 2.60 Solve: 8m+9=5m.8m+9=5m. 8m+9=5m.8m+9=5m. Example 2.31 Solve: 12x=−x+26.12x=−x+26. 12x=−x+26.12x=−x+26. Solution The only constant is on the right, so let the left side be the “variable” side. Try It 2.61 Solve: 12j=−4j+32.12j=−4j+32. 12j=−4j+32.12j=−4j+32. Try It 2.62 Solve: 8h=−4h+12.8h=−4h+12. 8h=−4h+12.8h=−4h+12."
Page 19,"The next example will be the first to have variables and constants on both sides of the equation. It may take several steps to solve this equation, so we need a clear and organized strategy. Example 2.32 Solve: 7x+5=6x+2.7x+5=6x+2. 7x+5=6x+2.7x+5=6x+2. Solution Try It 2.63 Solve: 12x+8=6x+2.12x+8=6x+2. 12x+8=6x+2.12x+8=6x+2. Try It 2.64 Solve: 9y+4=7y+12.9y+4=7y+12. 9y+4=7y+12.9y+4=7y+12. We’ll list the steps below so you can easily refer to them. But we’ll call this the ‘Beginning Strategy’ because we’ll be adding some steps later in this chapter. How To Beginning Strategy for Solving Equations with Variables and Constants on Both Sides of the Equation. Step 1. Choose which side will be the “variable” side—the other side will be the “constant” side. Step 2. Collect the variable terms to the “variable” side of the equation, using the Addition or Subtraction Property of Equality. Step 3. Collect all the constants to the other side of the equation, using the Addition or Subtraction Property of Equality. Step 4. Make the coefficient of the variable equal 1, using the Multiplication or Division Property of Equality. Step 5. Check the solution by substituting it into the original equation. In Step 1, a helpful approach is to make the “variable” side the side that has the variable with the larger coefficient. This usually makes the arithmetic easier. Example 2.33 Solve: 8n−4=−2n+6.8n−4=−2n+6. 8n−4=−2n+6.8n−4=−2n+6. Solution In the first step, choose the variable side by comparing the coefficients of the variables on each side. Try It 2.65 Solve: 8q−5=−4q+7.8q−5=−4q+7. 8q−5=−4q+7.8q−5=−4q+7. Try It 2.66 Solve: 7n−3=n+3.7n−3=n+3. 7n−3=n+3.7n−3=n+3. Example 2.34 Solve: 7a−3=13a+7.7a−3=13a+7. 7a−3=13a+7.7a−3=13a+7. Solution In the first step, choose the variable side by comparing the coefficients of the variables on each side. Since 13>713>7, make the right side the “variable” side and the left side the “constant” side. 13>713>7 Try It 2.67 Solve: 2a−2=6a+18.2a−2=6a+18. 2a−2=6a+18.2a−2=6a+18. Try It 2.68 Solve: 4k−1=7k+17.4k−1=7k+17. 4k−1=7k+17.4k−1=7k+17. In the last example, we could have made the left side the “variable” side, but it would have led to a negative coefficient on the variable term. (Try it!) While we could work with the negative, there is less chance of errors when working with positives. The strategy outlined above helps avoid the negatives! To solve an equation with fractions, we just follow the steps of our strategy to get the solution! Example 2.35 Solve: 54x+6=14x−2.54x+6=14x−2. 54x+6=14x−2.54x+6=14x−2. Solution Since 54>1454>14, make the left side the “variable” side and the right side the “constant” side. 54>1454>14 Try It 2.69 Solve: 78x−12=−18x−2.78x−12=−18x−2. 78x−12=−18x−2.78x−12=−18x−2. Try It 2.70 Solve: 76y+11=16y+8.76y+11=16y+8. 76y+11=16y+8.76y+11=16y+8. We will use the same strategy to find the solution for an equation with decimals. Example 2.36 Solve: 7.8x+4=5.4x−8.7.8x+4=5.4x−8. 7.8x+4=5.4x−8.7.8x+4=5.4x−8. Solution Since 7.8>5.47.8>5.4, make the left side the “variable” side and the right side the “constant” side. 7.8>5.47.8>5.4 Try It 2.71 Solve: 2.8x+12=−1.4x−9.2.8x+12=−1.4x−9. 2.8x+12=−1.4x−9.2.8x+12=−1.4x−9. Try It 2.72 Solve: 3.6y+8=1.2y−4.3.6y+8=1.2y−4. 3.6y+8=1.2y−4.3.6y+8=1.2y−4."

Page 20,"Until now we have dealt with solving one specific form of a linear equation. It is time now to lay out one overall strategy that can be used to solve any linear equation. Some equations we solve will not require all these steps to solve, but many will. Beginning by simplifying each side of the equation makes the remaining steps easier. Example 2.37 Solve: −6(x+3)=24.−6(x+3)=24. −6(x+3)=24.−6(x+3)=24. Solution Try It 2.73 Solve: 5(x+3)=35.5(x+3)=35. 5(x+3)=35.5(x+3)=35. Try It 2.74 Solve: 6(y−4)=−18.6(y−4)=−18. 6(y−4)=−18.6(y−4)=−18. How To General strategy for solving linear equations. Step 1. Simplify each side of the equation as much as possible.
Use the Distributive Property to remove any parentheses.
Combine like terms. Step 2. Collect all the variable terms on one side of the equation.
Use the Addition or Subtraction Property of Equality. Step 3. Collect all the constant terms on the other side of the equation.
Use the Addition or Subtraction Property of Equality. Step 4. Make the coefficient of the variable term to equal to 1.
Use the Multiplication or Division Property of Equality.

Page 20,"Consider the equation we solved at the start of the last section, 7x+8=−137x+8=−13. The solution we found was x=−3x=−3. This means the equation 7x+8=−137x+8=−13 is true when we replace the variable, x, with the value −3−3. We showed this when we checked the solution x=−3x=−3 and evaluated 7x+8=−137x+8=−13 for x=−3x=−3. 7x+8=−137x+8=−13 x=−3x=−3 7x+8=−137x+8=−13 −3−3 x=−3x=−3 7x+8=−137x+8=−13 x=−3x=−3 If we evaluate 7x+87x+8 for a different value of x, the left side will not be −13−13. 7x+87x+8 −13−13 The equation 7x+8=−137x+8=−13 is true when we replace the variable, x, with the value −3−3, but not true when we replace x with any other value. Whether or not the equation 7x+8=−137x+8=−13 is true depends on the value of the variable. Equations like this are called conditional equations. 7x+8=−137x+8=−13 −3−3 7x+8=−137x+8=−13 All the equations we have solved so far are conditional equations. Conditional equation An equation that is true for one or more values of the variable and false for all other values of the variable is a conditional equation. conditional equation Now let’s consider the equation 2y+6=2(y+3)2y+6=2(y+3). Do you recognize that the left side and the right side are equivalent? Let’s see what happens when we solve for y. 2y+6=2(y+3)2y+6=2(y+3) But 6=66=6 is true. 6=66=6 This means that the equation 2y+6=2(y+3)2y+6=2(y+3) is true for any value of y. We say the solution to the equation is all of the real numbers. An equation that is true for any value of the variable like this is called an identity. 2y+6=2(y+3)2y+6=2(y+3) identity Identity An equation that is true for any value of the variable is called an identity. identity The solution of an identity is all real numbers. What happens when we solve the equation 5z=5z−15z=5z−1? 5z=5z−15z=5z−1 But 0≠−10≠−1. 0≠−10≠−1 Solving the equation 5z=5z−15z=5z−1 led to the false statement 0=−10=−1. The equation 5z=5z−15z=5z−1 will not be true for any value of z. It has no solution. An equation that has no solution, or that is false for all values of the variable, is called a contradiction. 5z=5z−15z=5z−1 0=−10=−1 5z=5z−15z=5z−1 contradiction Contradiction An equation that is false for all values of the variable is called a contradiction. contradiction A contradiction has no solution. Example 2.45 Classify the equation as a conditional equation, an identity, or a contradiction. Then state the solution. 6(2n−1)+3=2n−8+5(2n+1)6(2n−1)+3=2n−8+5(2n+1) 6(2n−1)+3=2n−8+5(2n+1)6(2n−1)+3=2n−8+5(2n+1) Solution Try It 2.89 Classify the equation as a conditional equation, an identity, or a contradiction and then state the solution: 4+9(3x−7)=−42x−13+23(3x−2)4+9(3x−7)=−42x−13+23(3x−2) 4+9(3x−7)=−42x−13+23(3x−2)4+9(3x−7)=−42x−13+23(3x−2) Try It 2.90 Classify the equation as a conditional equation, an identity, or a contradiction and then state the solution: 8(1−3x)+15(2x+7)=2(x+50)+4(x+3)+18(1−3x)+15(2x+7)=2(x+50)+4(x+3)+1 8(1−3x)+15(2x+7)=2(x+50)+4(x+3)+18(1−3x)+15(2x+7)=2(x+50)+4(x+3)+1 Example 2.46 Classify as a conditional equation, an identity, or a contradiction.

5 312 . Fencing Micah has 44 feet of fencing to make a dog run in his yard. He wants the length to be 2.5 feet more than the width. Find the length, L, by solving the equation 2L+2(L−2.5)=442L+2(L−2.5)=44. 2L+2(L−2.5)=442L+2(L−2.5)=44 . Coins Rhonda has $1.90 in nickels and dimes. The number of dimes is one less than twice the number of nickels. Find the number of nickels, n, by solving the equation 0.05n+0.10(2n−1)=1.900.05n+0.10(2n−1)=1.90. 0.05n+0.10(2n−1)=1.900.05n+0.10(2n−1)=1.90 314 .

Page 21,"Let’s use the general strategy for solving linear equations introduced earlier to solve the equation, 18x+12=1418x+12=14. 18x+12=1418x+12=14 This method worked fine, but many students do not feel very confident when they see all those fractions. So, we are going to show an alternate method to solve equations with fractions. This alternate method eliminates the fractions. We will apply the Multiplication Property of Equality and multiply both sides of an equation by the least common denominator of all the fractions in the equation. The result of this operation will be a new equation, equivalent to the first, but without fractions. This process is called “clearing” the equation of fractions. Let’s solve a similar equation, but this time use the method that eliminates the fractions. Example 2.48 Solve: 16y−13=5616y−13=56. 16y−13=5616y−13=56 Solution Try It 2.95 Solve: 14x+12=5814x+12=58. 14x+12=5814x+12=58 Try It 2.96 Solve: 18x+12=1418x+12=14. 18x+12=1418x+12=14 Notice in Example 2.48, once we cleared the equation of fractions, the equation was like those we solved earlier in this chapter. We changed the problem to one we already knew how to solve! We then used the General Strategy for Solving Linear Equations. How To Strategy to solve equations with fraction coefficients. Step 1. Find the least common denominator of all the fractions in the equation. Step 2. Multiply both sides of the equation by that LCD. This clears the fractions. Step 3. Solve using the General Strategy for Solving Linear Equations. Example 2.49 Solve: 6=12v+25v−34v6=12v+25v−34v. 6=12v+25v−34v6=12v+25v−34v Solution We want to clear the fractions by multiplying both sides of the equation by the LCD of all the fractions in the equation. Try It 2.97 Solve: 7=12x+34x−23x7=12x+34x−23x. 7=12x+34x−23x7=12x+34x−23x Try It 2.98 Solve: −1=12u+14u−23u−1=12u+14u−23u. −1=12u+14u−23u−1=12u+14u−23u In the next example, we again have variables on both sides of the equation. Example 2.50 Solve: a+34=38a−12a+34=38a−12. a+34=38a−12a+34=38a−12 Solution Try It 2.99 Solve: x+13=16x−12x+13=16x−12. x+13=16x−12x+13=16x−12 Try It 2.100 Solve: c+34=12c−14c+34=12c−14. c+34=12c−14c+34=12c−14 In the next example, we start by using the Distributive Property. This step clears the fractions right away. Example 2.51 Solve: −5=14(8x+4)−5=14(8x+4). −5=14(8x+4)−5=14(8x+4) Solution Try It 2.101 Solve: −11=12(6p+2)−11=12(6p+2). −11=12(6p+2)−11=12(6p+2) Try It 2.102 Solve: 8=13(9q+6)8=13(9q+6). 8=13(9q+6)8=13(9q+6) In the next example, even after distributing, we still have fractions to clear. Example 2.52 Solve: 12(y−5)=14(y−1)12(y−5)=14(y−1). 12(y−5)=14(y−1)12(y−5)=14(y−1) Solution Try It 2.103 Solve: 15(n+3)=14(n+2)15(n+3)=14(n+2). 15(n+3)=14(n+2)15(n+3)=14(n+2) Try It 2.104 Solve: 12(m−3)=14(m−7)12(m−3)=14(m−7). 12(m−3)=14(m−7)12(m−3)=14(m−7) Example 2.53 Solve: 5x−34=x25x−34=x2. 5x−34=x25x−34=x2 Solution Try It 2.105 Solve: 4y−73=y64y−73=y6. 4y−73=y64y−73=y6 Try It 2.106 Solve: −2z−54=z8−2z−54=z8. −2z−54=z8−2z−54=z8 Example 2.54 Solve: a6+2=a4+3a6+2=a4+3. a6+2=a4+3a6+2=a4+3 Solution Try It 2.107 Solve: b10+2=b4+5b10+2=b4+5. b10+2=b4+5b10+2=b4+5 Try It 2.108 Solve: c6+3=c3+4c6+3=c3+4. c6+3=c3+4c6+3=c3+4 Example 2.55 Solve: 4q+32+6=3q+544q+32+6=3q+54. 4q+32+6=3q+544q+32+6=3q+54 Solution Try It 2.109 Solve: 3r+56+1=4r+333r+56+1=4r+33. 3r+56+1=4r+333r+56+1=4r+33 Try It 2.110 Solve: 2s+32+1=3s+242s+32+1=3s+24. 2s+32+1=3s+242s+32+1=3s+24"

Page 21,"Some equations have decimals in them. This kind of equation will occur when we solve problems dealing with money or percentages. But decimals can also be expressed as fractions. For example, 0.3=3100.3=310 and 0.17=171000.17=17100. So, with an equation with decimals, we can use the same method we used to clear fractions—multiply both sides of the equation by the least common denominator. 0.3=3100.3=310 0.17=171000.17=17100 Example 2.56 Solve: 0.06x+0.02=0.25x−1.50.06x+0.02=0.25x−1.5. 0.06x+0.02=0.25x−1.50.06x+0.02=0.25x−1.5 Solution Look at the decimals and think of the equivalent fractions. Notice, the LCD is 100. By multiplying by the LCD, we will clear the decimals from the equation. Try It 2.111 Solve: 0.14h+0.12=0.35h−2.40.14h+0.12=0.35h−2.4. 0.14h+0.12=0.35h−2.40.14h+0.12=0.35h−2.4 Try It 2.112 Solve: 0.65k−0.1=0.4k−0.350.65k−0.1=0.4k−0.35. 0.65k−0.1=0.4k−0.350.65k−0.1=0.4k−0.35 The next example uses an equation that is typical of the money applications in the next chapter. Notice that we distribute the decimal before we clear all the decimals. Example 2.57 Solve: 0.25x+0.05(x+3)=2.850.25x+0.05(x+3)=2.85. 0.25x+0.05(x+3)=2.850.25x+0.05(x+3)=2.85 Solution Try It 2.113 Solve: 0.25n+0.05(n+5)=2.950.25n+0.05(n+5)=2.95. 0.25n+0.05(n+5)=2.950.25n+0.05(n+5)=2.95 Try It 2.114 Solve: 0.10d+0.05(d−5)=2.150.10d+0.05(d−5)=2.15. 0.10d+0.05(d−5)=2.150.10d+0.05(d−5)=2.15"

Solve the equation 0.10d+0.01(d+2)=20.10d+0.01(d+2)=2 for dd, the number of dimes. 0.10d+0.01(d+2)=20.10d+0.01(d+2)=2 dd . Stamps Paula bought $22.82 worth of 49-cent stamps and 21-cent stamps. The number of 21-cent stamps was 8 less than the number of 49-cent stamps. Solve the equation 0.49s+0.21(s−8)=22.820.49s+0.21(s−8)=22.82 for s, to find the number of 49-cent stamps Paula bought. 0.49s+0.21(s−8)=22.820.49s+0.21(s−8)=22.82 372 . Explain how you find the least common denominator of 3838, 1616, and 2323. 3838 1616 2323 . If an equation has several fractions, how does multiplying both sides by the LCD make it easier to solve? 374 . If an equation has fractions only on one side, why do you have to multiply both sides of the equation by the LCD? . In the equation 0.35x+2.1=3.850.35x+2.1=3.85 what is the LCD? How do you know? 0.35x+2.1=3.850.35x+2.1=3.85 ⓐ After completing the exercises, use this checklist to evaluate your mastery of the objectives of this section. ⓐ ⓑ Overall, after looking at the checklist, do you think you are well-prepared for the next section?

Page 22,"One formula you will use often in algebra and in everyday life is the formula for distance traveled by an object moving at a constant rate. Rate is an equivalent word for “speed.” The basic idea of rate may already familiar to you. Do you know what distance you travel if you drive at a steady rate of 60 miles per hour for 2 hours? (This might happen if you use your car’s cruise control while driving on the highway.) If you said 120 miles, you already know how to use this formula! Distance, Rate, and Time For an object moving at a uniform (constant) rate, the distance traveled, the elapsed time, and the rate are related by the formula: We will use the Strategy for Solving Applications that we used earlier in this chapter. When our problem requires a formula, we change Step 4. In place of writing a sentence, we write the appropriate formula. We write the revised steps here for reference. How To Solve an application (with a formula). Step 1. Read the problem. Make sure all the words and ideas are understood. Step 2. Identify what we are looking for. Step 3. Name what we are looking for. Choose a variable to represent that quantity. Step 4. Translate into an equation. Write the appropriate formula for the situation. Substitute in the given information. Step 5. Solve the equation using good algebra techniques. Step 6. Check the answer in the problem and make sure it makes sense. Step 7. Answer the question with a complete sentence. You may want to create a mini-chart to summarize the information in the problem. See the chart in this first example. Example 2.58 Jamal rides his bike at a uniform rate of 12 miles per hour for 312312 hours. What distance has he traveled? 312312 Solution Try It 2.115 Lindsay drove for 512512 hours at 60 miles per hour. How much distance did she travel? 512512 Try It 2.116 Trinh walked for 213213 hours at 3 miles per hour. How far did she walk? 213213 Example 2.59 Rey is planning to drive from his house in San Diego to visit his grandmother in Sacramento, a distance of 520 miles. If he can drive at a steady rate of 65 miles per hour, how many hours will the trip take? Solution Try It 2.117 Lee wants to drive from Phoenix to his brother’s apartment in San Francisco, a distance of 770 miles. If he drives at a steady rate of 70 miles per hour, how many hours will the trip take? Try It 2.118 Yesenia is 168 miles from Chicago. If she needs to be in Chicago in 3 hours, at what rate does she need to drive?"

Page 22,"You are probably familiar with some geometry formulas. A formula is a mathematical description of the relationship between variables. Formulas are also used in the sciences, such as chemistry, physics, and biology. In medicine they are used for calculations for dispensing medicine or determining body mass index. Spreadsheet programs rely on formulas to make calculations. It is important to be familiar with formulas and be able to manipulate them easily. In Example 2.58 and Example 2.59, we used the formula d=rtd=rt. This formula gives the value of dd, distance, when you substitute in the values of randtrandt, the rate and time. But in Example 2.59, we had to find the value of tt. We substituted in values of dandrdandr and then used algebra to solve for tt. If you had to do this often, you might wonder why there is not a formula that gives the value of tt when you substitute in the values of dandrdandr. We can make a formula like this by solving the formula d=rtd=rt for tt. d=rtd=rt dd randtrandt tt dandrdandr tt tt dandrdandr d=rtd=rt tt To solve a formula for a specific variable means to isolate that variable on one side of the equals sign with a coefficient of 1. All other variables and constants are on the other side of the equals sign. To see how to solve a formula for a specific variable, we will start with the distance, rate and time formula. Example 2.60 Solve the formula d=rtd=rt for tt: d=rtd=rt tt ⓐ ⓑ Solution We will write the solutions side-by-side to demonstrate that solving a formula in general uses the same steps as when we have numbers to substitute. ⓐ ⓑ We say the formula t=drt=dr is solved for tt. t=drt=dr tt Try It 2.119 Solve the formula d=rtd=rt for rr: d=rtd=rt rr ⓐ when d=180andt=4d=180andt=4 ⓑ in general ⓐ d=180andt=4d=180andt=4 ⓑ Try It 2.120 Solve the formula d=rtd=rt for rr: d=rtd=rt rr ⓐ when d=780andt=12d=780andt=12 ⓑ in general ⓐ d=780andt=12d=780andt=12 ⓑ Example 2.61 Solve the formula A=12bhA=12bh for hh: A=12bhA=12bh hh ⓐ when A=90A=90 and b=15b=15 ⓑ in general ⓐ A=90A=90 b=15b=15 ⓑ Solution ⓐ ⓑ We can now find the height of a triangle, if we know the area and the base, by using the formula h=2Abh=2Ab. h=2Abh=2Ab Try It 2.121 Use the formula A=12bhA=12bh to solve for hh: A=12bhA=12bh hh ⓐ when A=170A=170 and b=17b=17 ⓑ in general ⓐ A=170A=170 b=17b=17 ⓑ Try It 2.122 Use the formula A=12bhA=12bh to solve for bb: A=12bhA=12bh bb ⓐ when A=62A=62 and h=31h=31 ⓑ in general ⓐ A=62A=62 h=31h=31 ⓑ The formula I=PrtI=Prt is used to calculate simple interest, I, for a principal, P, invested at rate, r, for t years.

You might be given an equation that is solved for y and need to solve it for x, or vice versa. In the following example, we’re given an equation with both x and y on the same side and we’ll solve it for y. Example 2.63 Solve the formula 3x+2y=183x+2y=18 for y: 3x+2y=183x+2y=18 ⓐ when x=4x=4 ⓑ in general ⓐ x=4x=4 ⓑ Solution ⓐ ⓑ Try It 2.125 Solve the formula 3x+4y=103x+4y=10 for y: 3x+4y=103x+4y=10 ⓐ when x=143x=143 ⓑ in general ⓐ x=143x=143 ⓑ Try It 2.126 Solve the formula 5x+2y=185x+2y=18 for y: 5x+2y=185x+2y=18 ⓐ when x=4x=4 ⓑ in general ⓐ x=4x=4 ⓑ In Examples 1.60 through 1.64 we used the numbers in part ⓐ as a guide to solving in general in part ⓑ. Now we will solve a formula in general without using numbers as a guide. ⓐ ⓑ Example 2.64 Solve the formula P=a+b+cP=a+b+c for aa.

Page 23,"Do you remember what it means for a number to be a solution to an equation? A solution of an equation is a value of a variable that makes a true statement when substituted into the equation. What about the solution of an inequality? What number would make the inequality x>3x>3 true? Are you thinking, ‘x could be 4’? That’s correct, but x could be 5 too, or 20, or even 3.001. Any number greater than 3 is a solution to the inequality x>3x>3. x>3x>3 x>3x>3 We show the solutions to the inequality x>3x>3 on the number line by shading in all the numbers to the right of 3, to show that all numbers greater than 3 are solutions. Because the number 3 itself is not a solution, we put an open parenthesis at 3. The graph of x>3x>3 is shown in Figure 2.7. Please note that the following convention is used: light blue arrows point in the positive direction and dark blue arrows point in the negative direction. x>3x>3 x>3x>3 Figure 2.7 The inequality x>3x>3 is graphed on this number line. The graph of the inequality x≥3x≥3 is very much like the graph of x>3x>3, but now we need to show that 3 is a solution, too. We do that by putting a bracket at x=3x=3, as shown in Figure 2.8. x≥3x≥3 x>3x>3 x=3x=3 Figure 2.8 The inequality x≥3x≥3 is graphed on this number line. Notice that the open parentheses symbol, (, shows that the endpoint of the inequality is not included. The open bracket symbol, [, shows that the endpoint is included. Example 2.66 Graph on the number line: ⓐ x≤1x≤1 ⓑ x<5x<5 ⓒ x>−1x>−1 ⓐ x≤1x≤1 ⓑ x<5x<5 ⓒ x>−1x>−1 Solution ⓐ ⓑ ⓒ Try It 2.131 Graph on the number line: ⓐ x≤−1x≤−1 ⓑ x>2x>2 ⓒ x<3x<3 ⓐ x≤−1x≤−1 ⓑ x>2x>2 ⓒ x<3x<3 Try It 2.132 Graph on the number line: ⓐ x>−2x>−2 ⓑ x<−3x<−3 ⓒ x≥−1x≥−1 ⓐ x>−2x>−2 ⓑ x<−3x<−3 ⓒ x≥−1x≥−1 We can also represent inequalities using interval notation. As we saw above, the inequality x>3x>3 means all numbers greater than 3. There is no upper end to the solution to this inequality. In interval notation, we express x>3x>3 as (3,∞).(3,∞). The symbol ∞∞ is read as ‘infinity’. It is not an actual number. Figure 2.9 shows both the number line and the interval notation. x>3x>3 interval notation x>3x>3 (3,∞).(3,∞). ∞∞ Figure 2.9 The inequality x>3x>3 is graphed on this number line and written in interval notation. The inequality x≤1x≤1 means all numbers less than or equal to 1. There is no lower end to those numbers. We write x≤1x≤1 in interval notation as (−∞,1](−∞,1]. The symbol −∞−∞ is read as ‘negative infinity’. Figure 2.10 shows both the number line and interval notation. x≤1x≤1 x≤1x≤1 (−∞,1](−∞,1] −∞−∞ Figure 2.10 The inequality x≤1x≤1 is graphed on this number line and written in interval notation. Inequalities, Number Lines, and Interval Notation Did you notice how the parenthesis or bracket in the interval notation matches the symbol at the endpoint of the arrow? These relationships are shown in Figure 2.11. Figure 2.11 The notation for inequalities on a number line and in interval notation use similar symbols to express the endpoints of intervals. Example 2.67 Graph on the number line and write in interval notation. ⓐ x≥−3x≥−3 ⓑ x<2.5x<2.5 ⓒ x≤−35x≤−35 ⓐ x≥−3x≥−3 ⓑ x<2.5x<2.5 ⓒ x≤−35x≤−35 Solution ⓐ ⓑ ⓒ Try It 2.133 Graph on the number line and write in interval notation: ⓐ x>2x>2 ⓑ x≤−1.5x≤−1.5 ⓒ x≥34x≥34 ⓐ x>2x>2 ⓑ x≤−1.5x≤−1.5 ⓒ x≥34x≥34 Try It 2.134 Graph on the number line and write in interval notation: ⓐ x≤−4x≤−4 ⓑ x≥0.5x≥0.5 ⓒ x<−23x<−23 ⓐ x≤−4x≤−4 ⓑ x≥0.5x≥0.5 ⓒ x<−23x<−23"

Page 23,"The Subtraction and Addition Properties of Equality state that if two quantities are equal, when we add or subtract the same amount from both quantities, the results will be equal. Properties of Equality Similar properties hold true for inequalities. Similarly we could show that the inequality also stays the same for addition. This leads us to the Subtraction and Addition Properties of Inequality. Properties of Inequality We use these properties to solve inequalities, taking the same steps we used to solve equations. Solving the inequality x+5>9x+5>9, the steps would look like this: x+5>9x+5>9 Table 2.6 Any number greater than 4 is a solution to this inequality.

Page 23,"The Division and Multiplication Properties of Equality state that if two quantities are equal, when we divide or multiply both quantities by the same amount, the results will also be equal (provided we don’t divide by 0). Properties of Equality Are there similar properties for inequalities? What happens to an inequality when we divide or multiply both sides by a constant? Consider some numerical examples. Does the inequality stay the same when we divide or multiply by a negative number? When we divide or multiply an inequality by a positive number, the inequality sign stays the same. When we divide or multiply an inequality by a negative number, the inequality sign reverses. Here are the Division and Multiplication Properties of Inequality for easy reference. Division and Multiplication Properties of Inequality When we divide or multiply an inequality by a: Example 2.69 Solve the inequality 7y<​​427y<​​42, graph the solution on the number line, and write the solution in interval notation. 7y<​​427y<​​42 Solution Try It 2.137 Solve the inequality, graph the solution on the number line, and write the solution in interval notation. c-8>0c-8>0 c-8>0c-8>0 Try It 2.138 Solve the inequality, graph the solution on the number line, and write the solution in interval notation. 12d≤​6012d≤​60 12d≤​6012d≤​60 Example 2.70 Solve the inequality −10a≥50−10a≥50, graph the solution on the number line, and write the solution in interval notation. −10a≥50−10a≥50 Solution Try It 2.139 Solve each inequality, graph the solution on the number line, and write the solution in interval notation. −8q<32−8q<32 −8q<32−8q<32 Try It 2.140 Solve each inequality, graph the solution on the number line, and write the solution in interval notation. −7r≤​−70−7r≤​−70 −7r≤​−70−7r≤​−70 Solving Inequalities Sometimes when solving an inequality, the variable ends up on the right. We can rewrite the inequality in reverse to get the variable to the left. Think about it as “If Xavier is taller than Alex, then Alex is shorter than Xavier.” Example 2.71 Solve the inequality −20<45u−20<45u, graph the solution on the number line, and write the solution in interval notation. −20<45u−20<45u Solution Try It 2.141 Solve the inequality, graph the solution on the number line, and write the solution in interval notation. 24≤38m24≤38m 24≤38m24≤38m Try It 2.142 Solve the inequality, graph the solution on the number line, and write the solution in interval notation. −24<43n−24<43n −24<43n−24<43n Example 2.72 Solve the inequality t−2≥8t−2≥8, graph the solution on the number line, and write the solution in interval notation. t−2≥8t−2≥8 Solution Try It 2.143 Solve the inequality, graph the solution on the number line, and write the solution in interval notation. k−12≤15k−12≤15 k−12≤15k−12≤15 Try It 2.144 Solve the inequality, graph the solution on the number line, and write the solution in interval notation. u−4≥−16u−4≥−16 u−4≥−16u−4≥−16"
Page 23,"Most inequalities will take more than one step to solve.

We recognize these forms when we are left with only constants as we solve the inequality. If the result is a true statement, we have an identity. If the result is a false statement, we have a contradiction.

Page 23,"To translate English sentences into inequalities, we need to recognize the phrases that indicate the inequality. Some words are easy, like ‘more than’ and ‘less than’. But others are not as obvious. Think about the phrase ‘at least’ – what does it mean to be ‘at least 21 years old’? It means 21 or more. The phrase ‘at least’ is the same as ‘greater than or equal to’. Table 2.7 shows some common phrases that indicate inequalities. Table 2.7 Example 2.77 Translate and solve.

Page 29,"“If you think you can… or think you can’t… you’re right.”—Henry Ford The world is full of word problems! Will my income qualify me to rent that apartment? How much punch do I need to make for the party? What size diamond can I afford to buy my girlfriend? Should I fly or drive to my family reunion? How much money do I need to fill the car with gas? How much tip should I leave at a restaurant? How many socks should I pack for vacation? What size turkey do I need to buy for Thanksgiving dinner, and then what time do I need to put it in the oven? If my sister and I buy our mother a present, how much does each of us pay? Now that we can solve equations, we are ready to apply our new skills to word problems. Do you know anyone who has had negative experiences in the past with word problems? Have you ever had thoughts like the student below? Figure 3.2 Negative thoughts can be barriers to success. When we feel we have no control, and continue repeating negative thoughts, we set up barriers to success. We need to calm our fears and change our negative feelings. Start with a fresh slate and begin to think positive thoughts. If we take control and believe we can be successful, we will be able to master word problems! Read the positive thoughts in Figure 3.3 and say them out loud. Figure 3.3 Thinking positive thoughts is a first step towards success. Think of something, outside of school, that you can do now but couldn’t do 3 years ago. Is it driving a car? Snowboarding? Cooking a gourmet meal? Speaking a new language? Your past experiences with word problems happened when you were younger—now you’re older and ready to succeed!"
Page 29,"We have reviewed translating English phrases into algebraic expressions, using some basic mathematical vocabulary and symbols. We have also translated English sentences into algebraic equations and solved some word problems. The word problems applied math to everyday situations. We restated the situation in one sentence, assigned a variable, and then wrote an equation to solve the problem. This method works as long as the situation is familiar and the math is not too complicated. Now, we’ll expand our strategy so we can use it to successfully solve any word problem. We’ll list the strategy here, and then we’ll use it to solve some problems. We summarize below an effective strategy for problem solving. How To Use a Problem-Solving Strategy to Solve Word Problems. Step 1. Read the problem. Make sure all the words and ideas are understood. Step 2. Identify what we are looking for. Step 3. Name what we are looking for. Choose a variable to represent that quantity. Step 4. Translate into an equation. It may be helpful to restate the problem in one sentence with all the important information. Then, translate the English sentence into an algebraic equation. Step 5. Solve the equation using good algebra techniques. Step 6. Check the answer in the problem and make sure it makes sense. Step 7. Answer the question with a complete sentence. Example 3.1 Pilar bought a purse on sale for $18, which is one-half of the original price. What was the original price of the purse? Solution Step 1. Read the problem. Read the problem two or more times if necessary. Look up any unfamiliar words in a dictionary or on the internet. Step 2. Identify what you are looking for. Did you ever go into your bedroom to get something and then forget what you were looking for? It’s hard to find something if you are not sure what it is! Read the problem again and look for words that tell you what you are looking for! Step 3. Name what we are looking for. Choose a variable to represent that quantity. We can use any letter for the variable, but choose one that makes it easy to remember what it represents. Step 4. Translate into an equation. It may be helpful to restate the problem in one sentence with all the important information. Translate the English sentence into an algebraic equation. Reread the problem carefully to see how the given information is related. Often, there is one sentence that gives this information, or it may help to write one sentence with all the important information. Look for clue words to help translate the sentence into algebra. Translate the sentence into an equation. Step 5. Solve the equation using good algebraic techniques. Even if you know the solution right away, using good algebraic techniques here will better prepare you to solve problems that do not have obvious answers. Step 6. Check the answer in the problem to make sure it makes sense. We solved the equation and found that p=36,p=36, which means “the original price” was $36. p=36,p=36, Step 7. Answer the question with a complete sentence. The problem asked “What was the original price of the purse?” If this were a homework exercise, our work might look like this: Pilar bought a purse on sale for $18, which is one-half the original price. What was the original price of the purse? Try It 3.1 Joaquin bought a bookcase on sale for $120, which was two-thirds of the original price. What was the original price of the bookcase? Try It 3.2 Two-fifths of the songs in Mariel’s playlist are country. If there are 16 country songs, what is the total number of songs in the playlist? Let’s try this approach with another example. Example 3.2 Ginny and her classmates formed a study group. The number of girls in the study group was three more than twice the number of boys. There were 11 girls in the study group. How many boys were in the study group? Solution Try It 3.3 Guillermo bought textbooks and notebooks at the bookstore. The number of textbooks was 3 more than twice the number of notebooks. He bought 7 textbooks. How many notebooks did he buy? Try It 3.4 Gerry worked Sudoku puzzles and crossword puzzles this week. The number of Sudoku puzzles he completed is eight more than twice the number of crossword puzzles. He completed 22 Sudoku puzzles. How many crossword puzzles did he do?"

Page 29,"Now that we have a problem solving strategy, we will use it on several different types of word problems. The first type we will work on is “number problems.” Number problems give some clues about one or more numbers. We use these clues to write an equation. Number problems don’t usually arise on an everyday basis, but they provide a good introduction to practicing the problem solving strategy outlined above. Example 3.3 The difference of a number and six is 13. Find the number. Solution Try It 3.5 The difference of a number and eight is 17. Find the number. Try It 3.6 The difference of a number and eleven is −7.−7. Find the number. −7.−7. Example 3.4 The sum of twice a number and seven is 15. Find the number. Solution Did you notice that we left out some of the steps as we solved this equation? If you’re not yet ready to leave out these steps, write down as many as you need. Try It 3.7 The sum of four times a number and two is 14. Find the number. Try It 3.8 The sum of three times a number and seven is 25. Find the number. Some number word problems ask us to find two or more numbers. It may be tempting to name them all with different variables, but so far we have only solved equations with one variable. In order to avoid using more than one variable, we will define the numbers in terms of the same variable. Be sure to read the problem carefully to discover how all the numbers relate to each other. Example 3.5 One number is five more than another. The sum of the numbers is 21. Find the numbers. Solution Try It 3.9 One number is six more than another. The sum of the numbers is twenty-four. Find the numbers. Try It 3.10 The sum of two numbers is fifty-eight. One number is four more than the other. Find the numbers. Example 3.6 The sum of two numbers is negative fourteen. One number is four less than the other. Find the numbers. Solution Try It 3.11 The sum of two numbers is negative twenty-three. One number is seven less than the other. Find the numbers. Try It 3.12 The sum of two numbers is −18.−18. One number is 40 more than the other. Find the numbers. −18.−18. Example 3.7 One number is ten more than twice another. Their sum is one. Find the numbers. Solution Try It 3.13 One number is eight more than twice another. Their sum is negative four. Find the numbers. Try It 3.14 One number is three more than three times another. Their sum is −5.−5. Find the numbers. −5.−5. Some number problems involve consecutive integers. Consecutive integers are integers that immediately follow each other. Examples of consecutive integers are: Notice that each number is one more than the number preceding it. So if we define the first integer as n, the next consecutive integer is n+1.n+1. The one after that is one more than n+1,n+1, so it is n+1+1,n+1+1, which is n+2.n+2. n+1.n+1. n+1,n+1, n+1+1,n+1+1, n+2.n+2. Example 3.8 The sum of two consecutive integers is 47. Find the numbers. Solution Try It 3.15 The sum of two consecutive integers is 95.95. Find the numbers. 95.95. Try It 3.16 The sum of two consecutive integers is −31.−31. Find the numbers. −31.−31. Example 3.9 Find three consecutive integers whose sum is −42.−42. −42.−42. Solution Try It 3.17 Find three consecutive integers whose sum is −96.−96. −96.−96. Try It 3.18 Find three consecutive integers whose sum is −36.−36. −36.−36. Now that we have worked with consecutive integers, we will expand our work to include consecutive even integers and consecutive odd integers. Consecutive even integers are even integers that immediately follow one another. Examples of consecutive even integers are: Notice each integer is 2 more than the number preceding it. If we call the first one n, then the next one is n+2.n+2. The next one would be n+2+2n+2+2 or n+4.n+4. n+2.n+2. n+2+2n+2+2 n+4.n+4. Consecutive odd integers are odd integers that immediately follow one another. Consider the consecutive odd integers 77, 79, and 81. Does it seem strange to add 2 (an even number) to get from one odd integer to the next? Do you get an odd number or an even number when we add 2 to 3? to 11? to 47? Whether the problem asks for consecutive even numbers or odd numbers, you don’t have to do anything different. The pattern is still the same—to get from one odd or one even integer to the next, add 2. Example 3.10 Find three consecutive even integers whose sum is 84. Solution Table 3.1 Try It 3.19 Find three consecutive even integers whose sum is 102. Try It 3.20 Find three consecutive even integers whose sum is −24.−24. −24.−24. Example 3.11 A married couple together earns $110,000 a year. The wife earns $16,000 less than twice what her husband earns. What does the husband earn? Solution Try It 3.21 According to the National Automobile Dealers Association, the average cost of a car in 2014 was $28,500. This was $1,500 less than 6 times the cost in 1975. What was the average cost of a car in 1975? Try It 3.22 U.S. Census data shows that the median price of new home in the United States in November 2014 was $280,900. This was $10,700 more than 14 times the price in November 1964. What was the median price of a new home in November 1964?"

Page 30,"We will solve percent equations using the methods we used to solve equations with fractions or decimals. Without the tools of algebra, the best method available to solve percent problems was by setting them up as proportions. Now as an algebra student, you can just translate English sentences into algebraic equations and then solve the equations. We can use any letter you like as a variable, but it is a good idea to choose a letter that will remind us of what you are looking for. We must be sure to change the given percent to a decimal when we put it in the equation. Example 3.12 Translate and solve: What number is 35% of 90? Solution Try It 3.23 Translate and solve: What number is 45% of 80? Try It 3.24 Translate and solve: What number is 55% of 60? We must be very careful when we translate the words in the next example. The unknown quantity will not be isolated at first, like it was in Example 3.12. We will again use direct translation to write the equation. Example 3.13 Translate and solve: 6.5% of what number is $1.17? Solution Try It 3.25 Translate and solve: 7.5% of what number is $1.95? Try It 3.26 Translate and solve: 8.5% of what number is $3.06? In the next example, we are looking for the percent. Example 3.14 Translate and solve: 144 is what percent of 96? Solution Note that we are asked to find percent, so we must have our final result in percent form. Try It 3.27 Translate and solve: 110 is what percent of 88? Try It 3.28 Translate and solve: 126 is what percent of 72?"

Page 30,"Many applications of percent—such as tips, sales tax, discounts, and interest—occur in our daily lives. To solve these applications we’ll translate to a basic percent equation, just like those we solved in previous examples. Once we translate the sentence into a percent equation, we know how to solve it. percent We will restate the problem solving strategy we used earlier for easy reference. How To Use a Problem-Solving Strategy to Solve an Application. Step 1. Read the problem. Make sure all the words and ideas are understood. Step 2. Identify what we are looking for. Step 3. Name what we are looking for. Choose a variable to represent that quantity. Step 4. Translate into an equation. It may be helpful to restate the problem in one sentence with all the important information. Then, translate the English sentence into an algebraic equation. Step 5. Solve the equation using good algebra techniques. Step 6. Check the answer in the problem and make sure it makes sense. Step 7. Answer the question with a complete sentence. Now that we have the strategy to refer to, and have practiced solving basic percent equations, we are ready to solve percent applications. Be sure to ask yourself if your final answer makes sense—since many of the applications will involve everyday situations, you can rely on your own experience. Example 3.15 Dezohn and his girlfriend enjoyed a nice dinner at a restaurant and his bill was $68.50. He wants to leave an 18% tip.

Page 30,"Do you know that banks pay you to keep your money? The money a customer puts in the bank is called the principal, P, and the money the bank pays the customer is called the interest. The interest is computed as a certain percent of the principal; called the rate of interest, r. We usually express rate of interest as a percent per year, and we calculate it by using the decimal equivalent of the percent. The variable t, (for time) represents the number of years the money is in the account. principal interest rate of interest To find the interest we use the simple interest formula, I=Prt.I=Prt. I=Prt.I=Prt. Simple Interest If an amount of money, P, called the principal, is invested for a period of t years at an annual interest rate r, the amount of interest, I, earned is Interest earned according to this formula is called simple interest. simple interest Interest may also be calculated another way, called compound interest. This type of interest will be covered in later math classes. The formula we use to calculate simple interest is I=Prt.I=Prt. To use the formula, we substitute in the values the problem gives us for the variables, and then solve for the unknown variable. It may be helpful to organize the information in a chart. I=Prt.I=Prt. Example 3.20 Nathaly deposited $12,500 in her bank account where it will earn 4% interest. How much interest will Nathaly earn in 5 years?

Try It 3.40 Susana invested a principal of $36,000 in her bank account with interest rate 6.5%. How much interest did she earn in 3 years? There may be times when we know the amount of interest earned on a given principal over a certain length of time, but we don’t know the rate. To find the rate, we use the simple interest formula, substitute in the given values for the principal and time, and then solve for the rate. Example 3.21 Loren loaned his brother $3,000 to help him buy a car. In 4 years his brother paid him back the $3,000 plus $660 in interest. What was the rate of interest?

Page 31,"In mixture problems, we will have two or more items with different values to combine together. The mixture model is used by grocers and bartenders to make sure they set fair prices for the products they sell. Many other professionals, like chemists, investment bankers, and landscapers also use the mixture model. mixture problems Manipulative Mathematics We will start by looking at an application everyone is familiar with—money! Imagine that we take a handful of coins from a pocket or purse and place them on a desk. How would we determine the value of that pile of coins? If we can form a step-by-step plan for finding the total value of the coins, it will help us as we begin solving coin word problems. So what would we do? To get some order to the mess of coins, we could separate the coins into piles according to their value. Quarters would go with quarters, dimes with dimes, nickels with nickels, and so on. To get the total value of all the coins, we would add the total value of each pile. How would we determine the value of each pile? Think about the dime pile—how much is it worth? If we count the number of dimes, we’ll know how many we have—the number of dimes. But this does not tell us the value of all the dimes. Say we counted 17 dimes, how much are they worth? Each dime is worth $0.10—that is the value of one dime. To find the total value of the pile of 17 dimes, multiply 17 by $0.10 to get $1.70. This is the total value of all 17 dimes. This method leads to the following model. Total Value of Coins For the same type of coin, the total value of a number of coins is found by using the model where    number is the number of coins value is the value of each coin total value is the total value of all the coins The number of dimes times the value of each dime equals the total value of the dimes. We could continue this process for each type of coin, and then we would know the total value of each type of coin. To get the total value of all the coins, add the total value of each type of coin. Let’s look at a specific case. Suppose there are 14 quarters, 17 dimes, 21 nickels, and 39 pennies. The total value of all the coins is $6.64. Notice how the chart helps organize all the information! Let’s see how we use this method to solve a coin word problem. Example 3.26 Adalberto has $2.25 in dimes and nickels in his pocket. He has nine more nickels than dimes. How many of each type of coin does he have? Solution Step 1. Read the problem. Make sure all the words and ideas are understood. Step 2. Identify what we are looking for. Step 3. Name what we are looking for. Choose a variable to represent that quantity. Next we counted the number of each type of coin. In this problem we cannot count each type of coin—that is what you are looking for—but we have a clue. There are nine more nickels than dimes. The number of nickels is nine more than the number of dimes. Fill in the “number” column in the table to help get everything organized. Now we have all the information we need from the problem! We multiply the number times the value to get the total value of each type of coin. While we do not know the actual number, we do have an expression to represent it. And so now multiply number·value=totalvalue.number·value=totalvalue. See how this is done in the table below. number·value=totalvalue.number·value=totalvalue. Notice that we made the heading of the table show the model. Step 4. Translate into an equation. It may be helpful to restate the problem in one sentence. Translate the English sentence into an algebraic equation. Write the equation by adding the total values of all the types of coins. Step 5. Solve the equation using good algebra techniques. Step 6.

How many coins of each type does she have? Try It 3.54 Alison has three times as many dimes as quarters in her purse. She has $9.35 altogether. How many coins of each type does she have? In the next example, we’ll show only the completed table—remember the steps we take to fill in the table. Example 3.28 Danny has $2.14 worth of pennies and nickels in his piggy bank. The number of nickels is two more than ten times the number of pennies. How many nickels and how many pennies does Danny have?

Page 31,"Problems involving tickets or stamps are very much like coin problems. Each type of ticket and stamp has a value, just like each type of coin does. So to solve these problems, we will follow the same steps we used to solve coin problems. Example 3.29 At a school concert, the total value of tickets sold was $1,506. Student tickets sold for $6 each and adult tickets sold for $9 each. The number of adult tickets sold was five less than three times the number of student tickets sold. How many student tickets and how many adult tickets were sold? Solution Step 1. Read the problem. Step 2. Identify what we are looking for. Step 3. Name. Represent the number of each type of ticket using variables. We know the number of adult tickets sold was five less than three times the number of student tickets sold. Multiply the number times the value to get the total value of each type of ticket. Step 4. Translate. Write the equation by adding the total values of each type of ticket. Step 5. Solve the equation. Step 6. Check the answer. There were 47 student tickets at $6 each and 136 adult tickets at $9 each. Is the total value $1,506? We find the total value of each type of ticket by multiplying the number of tickets times its value then add to get the total value of all the tickets sold. Step 7. Answer the question. They sold 47 student tickets and 136 adult tickets. Try It 3.57 The first day of a water polo tournament the total value of tickets sold was $17,610. One-day passes sold for $20 and tournament passes sold for $30. The number of tournament passes sold was 37 more than the number of day passes sold. How many day passes and how many tournament passes were sold? Try It 3.58 At the movie theater, the total value of tickets sold was $2,612.50. Adult tickets sold for $10 each and senior/child tickets sold for $7.50 each. The number of senior/child tickets sold was 25 less than twice the number of adult tickets sold. How many senior/child tickets and how many adult tickets were sold? We have learned how to find the total number of tickets when the number of one type of ticket is based on the number of the other type. Next, we’ll look at an example where we know the total number of tickets and have to figure out how the two types of tickets relate. Suppose Bianca sold a total of 100 tickets. Each ticket was either an adult ticket or a child ticket. If she sold 20 child tickets, how many adult tickets did she sell? If she sold 45 child tickets, how many adult tickets did she sell? What if she sold 75 child tickets? How many adult tickets did she sell? Now, suppose Bianca sold x child tickets. Then how many adult tickets did she sell? To find out, we would follow the same logic we used above. In each case, we subtracted the number of child tickets from 100 to get the number of adult tickets. We now do the same with x. We have summarized this below. We can apply these techniques to other examples Example 3.30 Galen sold 810 tickets for his church’s carnival for a total of $2,820. Children’s tickets cost $3 each and adult tickets cost $5 each. How many children’s tickets and how many adult tickets did he sell? Solution Step 1. Read the problem. Step 2. Identify what we are looking for. Step 3. Name. Represent the number of each type of ticket using variables. Step 4. Translate. Step 5. Solve the equation. How many adults? Step 6. Check the answer. There were 615 children’s tickets at $3 each and 195 adult tickets at $5 each. Is the total value $2,820? Step 7. Answer the question. Galen sold 615 children’s tickets and 195 adult tickets. Try It 3.59 During her shift at the museum ticket booth, Leah sold 115 tickets for a total of $1,163. Adult tickets cost $12 and student tickets cost $5. How many adult tickets and how many student tickets did Leah sell? Try It 3.60 A whale-watching ship had 40 paying passengers on board. The total collected from tickets was $1,196. Full-fare passengers paid $32 each and reduced-fare passengers paid $26 each. How many full-fare passengers and how many reduced-fare passengers were on the ship? Now, we’ll do one where we fill in the table all at once. Example 3.31 Monica paid $8.36 for stamps. The number of 41-cent stamps was four more than twice the number of two-cent stamps. How many 41-cent stamps and how many two-cent stamps did Monica buy? Solution The types of stamps are 41-cent stamps and two-cent stamps. Their names also give the value! “The number of 41-cent stamps was four more than twice the number of two-cent stamps.” Table 3.9 Try It 3.61 Eric paid $13.36 for stamps. The number of 41-cent stamps was eight more than twice the number of two-cent stamps. How many 41-cent stamps and how many two-cent stamps did Eric buy? Try It 3.62 Kailee paid $12.66 for stamps. The number of 41-cent stamps was four less than three times the number of 20-cent stamps. How many 41-cent stamps and how many 20-cent stamps did Kailee buy?"
Page 31,"Now we’ll solve some more general applications of the mixture model. Grocers and bartenders use the mixture model to set a fair price for a product made from mixing two or more ingredients. Financial planners use the mixture model when they invest money in a variety of accounts and want to find the overall interest rate. Landscape designers use the mixture model when they have an assortment of plants and a fixed budget, and event coordinators do the same when choosing appetizers and entrees for a banquet. Our first mixture word problem will be making trail mix from raisins and nuts. Example 3.32 Henning is mixing raisins and nuts to make 10 pounds of trail mix. Raisins cost $2 a pound and nuts cost $6 a pound. If Henning wants his cost for the trail mix to be $5.20 a pound, how many pounds of raisins and how many pounds of nuts should he use? Solution As before, we fill in a chart to organize our information. The 10 pounds of trail mix will come from mixing raisins and nuts. We enter the price per pound for each item. We multiply the number times the value to get the total value. Notice that the last line in the table gives the information for the total amount of the mixture. We know the value of the raisins plus the value of the nuts will be the value of the trail mix. Try It 3.63 Orlando is mixing nuts and cereal squares to make a party mix. Nuts sell for $7 a pound and cereal squares sell for $4 a pound. Orlando wants to make 30 pounds of party mix at a cost of $6.50 a pound, how many pounds of nuts and how many pounds of cereal squares should he use? Try It 3.64 Becca wants to mix fruit juice and soda to make a punch. She can buy fruit juice for $3 a gallon and soda for $4 a gallon. If she wants to make 28 gallons of punch at a cost of $3.25 a gallon, how many gallons of fruit juice and how many gallons of soda should she buy? We can also use the mixture model to solve investment problems using simple interest. We have used the simple interest formula, I=Prt,I=Prt, where tt represented the number of years. When we just need to find the interest for one year, t=1,t=1, so then I=Pr.I=Pr. simple interest I=Prt,I=Prt, tt t=1,t=1, I=Pr.I=Pr. Example 3.33 Stacey has $20,000 to invest in two different bank accounts. One account pays interest at 3% per year and the other account pays interest at 5% per year. How much should she invest in each account if she wants to earn 4.5% interest per year on the total amount? Solution We will fill in a chart to organize our information. We will use the simple interest formula to find the interest earned in the different accounts. The interest on the mixed investment will come from adding the interest from the account earning 3% and the interest from the account earning 5% to get the total interest on the $20,000. The amount invested is the principal for each account. We enter the interest rate for each account. We multiply the amount invested times the rate to get the interest. Notice that the total amount invested, 20,000, is the sum of the amount invested at 3% and the amount invested at 5%. And the total interest, 0.045(20,000),0.045(20,000), is the sum of the interest earned in the 3% account and the interest earned in the 5% account. 0.045(20,000),0.045(20,000), As with the other mixture applications, the last column in the table gives us the equation to solve. Try It 3.65 Remy has $14,000 to invest in two mutual funds. One fund pays interest at 4% per year and the other fund pays interest at 7% per year. How much should she invest in each fund if she wants to earn 6.1% interest on the total amount? Try It 3.66 Marco has $8,000 to save for his daughter’s college education. He wants to divide it between one account that pays 3.2% interest per year and another account that pays 8% interest per year. How much should he invest in each account if he wants the interest on the total investment to be 6.5%?"

Page 32,"In this section we will use some common geometry formulas. We will adapt our problem-solving strategy so that we can solve geometry applications. The geometry formula will name the variables and give us the equation to solve. In addition, since these applications will all involve shapes of some sort, most people find it helpful to draw a figure and label it with the given information. We will include this in the first step of the problem solving strategy for geometry applications. How To Solve Geometry Applications. Step 1. Read the problem and make sure all the words and ideas are understood. Draw the figure and label it with the given information. Step 2. Identify what we are looking for. Step 3. Label what we are looking for by choosing a variable to represent it. Step 4. Translate into an equation by writing the appropriate formula or model for the situation. Substitute in the given information. Step 5. Solve the equation using good algebra techniques. Step 6. Check the answer by substituting it back into the equation solved in step 5 and by making sure it makes sense in the context of the problem. Step 7. Answer the question with a complete sentence. We will start geometry applications by looking at the properties of triangles. Let’s review some basic facts about triangles. Triangles have three sides and three interior angles. Usually each side is labeled with a lowercase letter to match the uppercase letter of the opposite vertex. The plural of the word vertex is vertices. All triangles have three vertices. Triangles are named by their vertices: The triangle in Figure 3.4 is called △ABC.△ABC. vertices △ABC.△ABC. Figure 3.4 Triangle ABC has vertices A, B, and C. The lengths of the sides are a, b, and c. The three angles of a triangle are related in a special way. The sum of their measures is 180°.180°. Note that we read m∠Am∠A as “the measure of angle A.” So in △ABC△ABC in Figure 3.4, 180°.180°. m∠Am∠A △ABC△ABC Because the perimeter of a figure is the length of its boundary, the perimeter of △ABC△ABC is the sum of the lengths of its three sides. perimeter △ABC△ABC To find the area of a triangle, we need to know its base and height. The height is a line that connects the base to the opposite vertex and makes a 90°90° angle with the base. We will draw △ABC△ABC again, and now show the height, h. See Figure 3.5. area 90°90° △ABC△ABC Figure 3.5 The formula for the area of △ABC△ABC is A=12bh,A=12bh, where b is the base and h is the height. Triangle Properties For △ABC△ABC △ABC△ABC Angle measures: Perimeter: Area: Example 3.34 The measures of two angles of a triangle are 55 and 82 degrees. Find the measure of the third angle. Solution Try It 3.67 The measures of two angles of a triangle are 31 and 128 degrees. Find the measure of the third angle. Try It 3.68 The measures of two angles of a triangle are 49 and 75 degrees. Find the measure of the third angle. Example 3.35 The perimeter of a triangular garden is 24 feet. The lengths of two sides are four feet and nine feet. How long is the third side? Solution Try It 3.69 The perimeter of a triangular garden is 48 feet. The lengths of two sides are 18 feet and 22 feet. How long is the third side? Try It 3.70 The lengths of two sides of a triangular window are seven feet and five feet. The perimeter is 18 feet. How long is the third side? Example 3.36 The area of a triangular church window is 90 square meters. The base of the window is 15 meters. What is the window’s height? Solution Try It 3.71 The area of a triangular painting is 126 square inches. The base is 18 inches. What is the height? Try It 3.72 A triangular tent door has an area of 15 square feet. The height is five feet. What is the base? The triangle properties we used so far apply to all triangles. Now we will look at one specific type of triangle—a right triangle. A right triangle has one 90°90° angle, which we usually mark with a small square in the corner. right triangle 90°90° Right Triangle A right triangle has one 90°90° angle, which is often marked with a square at the vertex. 90°90° Example 3.37 One angle of a right triangle measures 28°.28°. What is the measure of the third angle? 28°.28°. Solution Try It 3.73 One angle of a right triangle measures 56°.56°. What is the measure of the other small angle? 56°.56°. Try It 3.74 One angle of a right triangle measures 45°.45°. What is the measure of the other small angle? 45°.45°. In the examples we have seen so far, we could draw a figure and label it directly after reading the problem. In the next example, we will have to define one angle in terms of another. We will wait to draw the figure until we write expressions for all the angles we are looking for. Example 3.38 The measure of one angle of a right triangle is 20 degrees more than the measure of the smallest angle. Find the measures of all three angles. Solution Try It 3.75 The measure of one angle of a right triangle is 50° more than the measure of the smallest angle. Find the measures of all three angles. Try It 3.76 The measure of one angle of a right triangle is 30° more than the measure of the smallest angle. Find the measures of all three angles."
Page 32,Solution
Page 32,"We have learned how the measures of the angles of a triangle relate to each other. Now, we will learn how the lengths of the sides relate to each other. An important property that describes the relationship among the lengths of the three sides of a right triangle is called the Pythagorean Theorem. This theorem has been used around the world since ancient times. It is named after the Greek philosopher and mathematician, Pythagoras, who lived around 500 BC. Pythagorean Theorem Before we state the Pythagorean Theorem, we need to introduce some terms for the sides of a triangle. Remember that a right triangle has a 90°90° angle, marked with a small square in the corner. The side of the triangle opposite the 90°90° angle is called the hypotenuse and each of the other sides are called legs. 90°90° 90°90° The Pythagorean Theorem tells how the lengths of the three sides of a right triangle relate to each other. It states that in any right triangle, the sum of the squares of the lengths of the two legs equals the square of the length of the hypotenuse. In symbols we say: in any right triangle, a2+b2=c2,a2+b2=c2, where aandbaandb are the lengths of the legs and cc is the length of the hypotenuse. a2+b2=c2,a2+b2=c2, aandbaandb cc Writing the formula in every exercise and saying it aloud as you write it, may help you remember the Pythagorean Theorem. The Pythagorean Theorem In any right triangle, a2+b2=c2.a2+b2=c2. a2+b2=c2.a2+b2=c2. where a and b are the lengths of the legs, c is the length of the hypotenuse. To solve exercises that use the Pythagorean Theorem, we will need to find square roots. We have used the notation mm and the definition: mm If m=n2,m=n2, then m=n,m=n, for n≥0.n≥0. m=n2,m=n2, m=n,m=n, n≥0.n≥0. For example, we found that 2525 is 5 because 25=52.25=52. 2525 25=52.25=52. Because the Pythagorean Theorem contains variables that are squared, to solve for the length of a side in a right triangle, we will have to use square roots. Example 3.39 Use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of the hypotenuse shown below. Solution Try It 3.77 Use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of the hypotenuse in the triangle shown below. Try It 3.78 Use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of the hypotenuse in the triangle shown below. Example 3.40 Use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of the leg shown below. Solution Try It 3.79 Use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of the leg in the triangle shown below.

Page 32,"You may already be familiar with the properties of rectangles. Rectangles have four sides and four right (90°)(90°) angles. The opposite sides of a rectangle are the same length. We refer to one side of the rectangle as the length, L, and its adjacent side as the width, W. (90°)(90°) rectangle The distance around this rectangle is L+W+L+W,L+W+L+W, or 2L+2W.2L+2W. This is the perimeter, P, of the rectangle. L+W+L+W,L+W+L+W, 2L+2W.2L+2W. perimeter What about the area of a rectangle? Imagine a rectangular rug that is 2-feet long by 3-feet wide. Its area is 6 square feet. There are six squares in the figure. area The area is the length times the width. The formula for the area of a rectangle is A=LW.A=LW. A=LW.A=LW. Properties of Rectangles Rectangles have four sides and four right (90°)(90°) angles. (90°)(90°) The lengths of opposite sides are equal. The perimeter of a rectangle is the sum of twice the length and twice the width. The area of a rectangle is the product of the length and the width. Example 3.42 The length of a rectangle is 32 meters and the width is 20 meters. What is the perimeter? Solution Try It 3.83 The length of a rectangle is 120 yards and the width is 50 yards. What is the perimeter? Try It 3.84 The length of a rectangle is 62 feet and the width is 48 feet. What is the perimeter? Example 3.43 The area of a rectangular room is 168 square feet. The length is 14 feet. What is the width? Solution Try It 3.85 The area of a rectangle is 598 square feet. The length is 23 feet. What is the width? Try It 3.86 The width of a rectangle is 21 meters. The area is 609 square meters. What is the length? Example 3.44 Find the length of a rectangle with perimeter 50 inches and width 10 inches. Solution Try It 3.87 Find the length of a rectangle with: perimeter 80 and width 25. Try It 3.88 Find the length of a rectangle with: perimeter 30 and width 6. We have solved problems where either the length or width was given, along with the perimeter or area; now we will learn how to solve problems in which the width is defined in terms of the length. We will wait to draw the figure until we write an expression for the width so that we can label one side with that expression. Example 3.45 The width of a rectangle is two feet less than the length. The perimeter is 52 feet. Find the length and width. Solution Try It 3.89 The width of a rectangle is seven meters less than the length. The perimeter is 58 meters. Find the length and width.

Page 33,"When planning a road trip, it often helps to know how long it will take to reach the destination or how far to travel each day. We would use the distance, rate, and time formula, D=rt,D=rt, which we have already seen. D=rt,D=rt, In this section, we will use this formula in situations that require a little more algebra to solve than the ones we saw earlier. Generally, we will be looking at comparing two scenarios, such as two vehicles travelling at different rates or in opposite directions. When the speed of each vehicle is constant, we call applications like this uniform motion problems. Our problem-solving strategies will still apply here, but we will add to the first step. The first step will include drawing a diagram that shows what is happening in the example. Drawing the diagram helps us understand what is happening so that we will write an appropriate equation. Then we will make a table to organize the information, like we did for the money applications. The steps are listed here for easy reference: How To Use a Problem-Solving Strategy in Distance, Rate, and Time Applications. Step 1. Step 2. Identify what we are looking for. Step 3. Step 4. Step 5. Solve the equation using good algebra techniques. Step 6. Check the answer in the problem and make sure it makes sense. Step 7. Answer the question with a complete sentence. Example 3.48 An express train and a local train leave Pittsburgh to travel to Washington, D.C. The express train can make the trip in 4 hours and the local train takes 5 hours for the trip. The speed of the express train is 12 miles per hour faster than the speed of the local train. Find the speed of both trains. Solution Step 1. Read the problem. Make sure all the words and ideas are understood. Step 2. Identify what we are looking for. Step 3. Name what we are looking for. Choose a variable to represent that quantity. r

Solve the equation using good algebra techniques. Step 6. Check the answer in the problem and make sure it makes sense. Table 3.11 Step 7. Answer the question with a complete sentence. Try It 3.95 Wayne and Dennis like to ride the bike path from Riverside Park to the beach. Dennis’s speed is seven miles per hour faster than Wayne’s speed, so it takes Wayne 2 hours to ride to the beach while it takes Dennis 1.5 hours for the ride. Find the speed of both bikers. Try It 3.96 Jeromy can drive from his house in Cleveland to his college in Chicago in 4.5 hours. It takes his mother 6 hours to make the same drive. Jeromy drives 20 miles per hour faster than his mother. Find Jeromy’s speed and his mother’s speed. In Example 3.48, the last example, we had two trains traveling the same distance. The diagram and the chart helped us write the equation we solved. Let’s see how this works in another case. Example 3.49 Christopher and his parents live 115 miles apart. They met at a restaurant between their homes to celebrate his mother’s birthday. Christopher drove 1.5 hours while his parents drove 1 hour to get to the restaurant. Christopher’s average speed was 10 miles per hour faster than his parents’ average speed. What were the average speeds of Christopher and of his parents as they drove to the restaurant? Solution Step 1. Read the problem. Make sure all the words and ideas are understood. Step 2. Identify what we are looking for. Step 3. Name what we are looking for. Choose a variable to represent that quantity. Fill in the speeds into the chart. Multiply the rate times the time to get the distance. Step 4. Translate into an equation. The distance Christopher travelled plus the distance his parents travel must add up to 115 miles. So we write: Step 5. Solve the equation using good algebra techniques. Table 3.12 Step 6. Check the answer in the problem and make sure it makes sense. Table 3.13 Table 3.14 Try It 3.97 Carina is driving from her home in Anaheim to Berkeley on the same day her brother is driving from Berkeley to Anaheim, so they decide to meet for lunch along the way in Buttonwillow. The distance from Anaheim to Berkeley is 410 miles. It takes Carina 3 hours to get to Buttonwillow, while her brother drives 4 hours to get there. The average speed Carina’s brother drove was 15 miles per hour faster than Carina’s average speed. Find Carina’s and her brother’s average speeds. Try It 3.98 Ashley goes to college in Minneapolis, 234 miles from her home in Sioux Falls. She wants her parents to bring her more winter clothes, so they decide to meet at a restaurant on the road between Minneapolis and Sioux Falls. Ashley and her parents both drove 2 hours to the restaurant. Ashley’s average speed was seven miles per hour faster than her parents’ average speed. Find Ashley’s and her parents’ average speed. As you read the next example, think about the relationship of the distances traveled. Which of the previous two examples is more similar to this situation? Example 3.50 Two truck drivers leave a rest area on the interstate at the same time. One truck travels east and the other one travels west. The truck traveling west travels at 70 mph and the truck traveling east has an average speed of 60 mph. How long will they travel before they are 325 miles apart? Solution Step 1. Read the problem. Make sure all the words and ideas are understood. Step 2. Identify what we are looking for. Step 3. Name what we are looking for. Choose a variable to represent that quantity. Step 4. Translate into an equation. Step 5. Solve the equation using good algebra techniques. Table 3.15 So it will take the trucks 2.5 hours to be 325 miles apart. Step 6. Check the answer in the problem and make sure it makes sense. Table 3.16 Table 3.17 Try It 3.99 Pierre and Monique leave their home in Portland at the same time.

Try It 3.100 Thanh and Nhat leave their office in Sacramento at the same time. Thanh drives north on I-5 at a speed of 72 miles per hour. Nhat drives south on I-5 at a speed of 76 miles per hour. How long will it take them to be 330 miles apart? Matching Units in Problems It is important to make sure the units match when we use the distance rate and time formula. For instance, if the rate is in miles per hour, then the time must be in hours. Example 3.51 When Katie Mae walks to school, it takes her 30 minutes. If she rides her bike, it takes her 15 minutes. Her speed is three miles per hour faster when she rides her bike than when she walks. What are her walking speed and her speed riding her bike? Solution First, we draw a diagram that represents the situation to help us see what is happening. We are asked to find her speed walking and riding her bike. Let’s call her walking speed r. Since her biking speed is three miles per hour faster, we will call that speed r+3.r+3. We write the speeds in the chart. r+3.r+3. The speed is in miles per hour, so we need to express the times in hours, too, in order for the units to be the same. Remember, one hour is 60 minutes. So: Next, we multiply rate times time to fill in the distance column. The equation will come from the fact that the distance from Katie Mae’s home to her school is the same whether she is walking or riding her bike. So we say: Try It 3.101 Suzy takes 50 minutes to hike uphill from the parking lot to the lookout tower. It takes her 30 minutes to hike back down to the parking lot. Her speed going downhill is 1.2 miles per hour faster than her speed going uphill. Find Suzy’s uphill and downhill speeds. Try It 3.102 Llewyn takes 45 minutes to drive his boat upstream from the dock to his favorite fishing spot. It takes him 30 minutes to drive the boat back downstream to the dock. The boat’s speed going downstream is four miles per hour faster than its speed going upstream. Find the boat’s upstream and downstream speeds. In the distance, rate, and time formula, time represents the actual amount of elapsed time (in hours, minutes, etc.). If a problem gives us starting and ending times as clock times, we must find the elapsed time in order to use the formula. elapsed time Example 3.52 Hamilton loves to travel to Las Vegas, 255 miles from his home in Orange County. On his last trip, he left his house at 2:00 pm. The first part of his trip was on congested city freeways. At 4:00 pm, the traffic cleared and he was able to drive through the desert at a speed 1.75 times as fast as when he drove in the congested area. He arrived in Las Vegas at 6:30 pm. How fast was he driving during each part of his trip? Solution A diagram will help us model this trip. Next, we create a table to organize the information. We know the total distance is 255 miles. We are looking for the rate of speed for each part of the trip. The rate in the desert is 1.75 times the rate in the city. If we let r=r= the rate in the city, then the rate in the desert is 1.75r.1.75r. r=r= 1.75r.1.75r. The times here are given as clock times. Hamilton started from home at 2:00 pm and entered the desert at 4:30 pm. So he spent two hours driving the congested freeways in the city. Then he drove faster from 4:00 pm until 6:30 pm in the desert. So he drove 2.5 hours in the desert. Now, we multiply the rates by the times. By looking at the diagram below, we can see that the sum of the distance driven in the city and the distance driven in the desert is 255 miles. Try It 3.103 Cruz is training to compete in a triathlon. He left his house at 6:00 and ran until 7:30. Then he rode his bike until 9:45. He covered a total distance of 51 miles. His speed when biking was 1.6 times his speed when running. Find Cruz’s biking and running speeds. Try It 3.104 Phuong left home on his bicycle at 10:00. He rode on the flat street until 11:15, then rode uphill until 11:45. He rode a total of 31 miles. His speed riding uphill was 0.6 times his speed on the flat street. Find his speed biking uphill and on the flat street."

Page 34,"Many real-life situations require us to solve inequalities. In fact, inequality applications are so common that we often do not even realize we are doing algebra. For example, how many gallons of gas can be put in the car for $20? Is the rent on an apartment affordable? Is there enough time before class to go get lunch, eat it, and return? How much money should each family member’s holiday gift cost without going over budget? The method we will use to solve applications with linear inequalities is very much like the one we used when we solved applications with equations. We will read the problem and make sure all the words are understood. Next, we will identify what we are looking for and assign a variable to represent it. We will restate the problem in one sentence to make it easy to translate into an inequality. Then, we will solve the inequality. Example 3.53 Emma got a new job and will have to move. Her monthly income will be $5,625. To qualify to rent an apartment, Emma’s monthly income must be at least three times as much as the rent. What is the highest rent Emma will qualify for? Solution Table 3.18 Try It 3.105 Alan is loading a pallet with boxes that each weighs 45 pounds. The pallet can safely support no more than 900 pounds. How many boxes can he safely load onto the pallet? Try It 3.106 The elevator in Yehire’s apartment building has a sign that says the maximum weight is 2,100 pounds. If the average weight of one person is 150 pounds, how many people can safely ride the elevator? Sometimes an application requires the solution to be a whole number, but the algebraic solution to the inequality is not a whole number. In that case, we must round the algebraic solution to a whole number. The context of the application will determine whether we round up or down. To check applications like this, we will round our answer to a number that is easy to compute with and make sure that number makes the inequality true. Example 3.54 Dawn won a mini-grant of $4,000 to buy tablet computers for her classroom. The tablets she would like to buy cost $254.12 each, including tax and delivery. What is the maximum number of tablets Dawn can buy? Solution Table 3.19 Try It 3.107 Angie has $20 to spend on juice boxes for her son’s preschool picnic. Each pack of juice boxes costs $2.63.

A common goal of most businesses is to make a profit. Profit is the money that remains when the expenses have been subtracted from the money earned. In the next example, we will find the number of jobs a small businessman needs to do every month in order to make a certain amount of profit. profit Example 3.57 Elliot has a landscape maintenance business. His monthly expenses are $1,100. If he charges $60 per job, how many jobs must he do to earn a profit of at least $4,000 a month? Solution Try It 3.113 Caleb has a pet sitting business.

Page 40,"Just like maps use a grid system to identify locations, a grid system is used in algebra to show a relationship between two variables in a rectangular coordinate system. The rectangular coordinate system is also called the xy-plane or the ‘coordinate plane’. rectangular coordinate system The horizontal number line is called the x-axis. The vertical number line is called the y-axis. The x-axis and the y-axis together form the rectangular coordinate system. These axes divide a plane into four regions, called quadrants. The quadrants are identified by Roman numerals, beginning on the upper right and proceeding counterclockwise. See Figure 4.2. Figure 4.2 ‘Quadrant’ has the root ‘quad,’ which means ‘four.’ In the rectangular coordinate system, every point is represented by an ordered pair. The first number in the ordered pair is the x-coordinate of the point, and the second number is the y-coordinate of the point. rectangular coordinate system x-coordinate y-coordinate Ordered Pair An ordered pair, (x,y)(x,y), gives the coordinates of a point in a rectangular coordinate system. ordered pair (x,y)(x,y) The first number is the x-coordinate. The second number is the y-coordinate. The phrase ‘ordered pair’ means the order is important. What is the ordered pair of the point where the axes cross? At that point both coordinates are zero, so its ordered pair is (0,0)(0,0). The point (0,0)(0,0) has a special name. It is called the origin. (0,0)(0,0) (0,0)(0,0) origin The Origin The point (0,0)(0,0) is called the origin. It is the point where the x-axis and y-axis intersect. (0,0)(0,0) origin We use the coordinates to locate a point on the xy-plane. Let’s plot the point (1,3)(1,3) as an example. First, locate 1 on the x-axis and lightly sketch a vertical line through x=1x=1. Then, locate 3 on the y-axis and sketch a horizontal line through y=3y=3. Now, find the point where these two lines meet—that is the point with coordinates (1,3)(1,3). (1,3)(1,3) x=1x=1 y=3y=3 (1,3)(1,3) Notice that the vertical line through x=1x=1 and the horizontal line through y=3y=3 are not part of the graph. We just used them to help us locate the point (1,3)(1,3). x=1x=1 y=3y=3 (1,3)(1,3) Example 4.1 Plot each point in the rectangular coordinate system and identify the quadrant in which the point is located: quadrant ⓐ (−5,4)(−5,4) ⓑ (−3,−4)(−3,−4) ⓒ (2,−3)(2,−3) ⓓ (−2,3)(−2,3) ⓔ (3,52)(3,52). ⓐ (−5,4)(−5,4) ⓑ (−3,−4)(−3,−4) ⓒ (2,−3)(2,−3) ⓓ (−2,3)(−2,3) ⓔ (3,52)(3,52) Solution The first number of the coordinate pair is the x-coordinate, and the second number is the y-coordinate. ⓐ ⓑ ⓒ ⓓ ⓔ Figure 4.3 Try It 4.1 Plot each point in a rectangular coordinate system and identify the quadrant in which the point is located: ⓐ (−2,1)(−2,1) ⓑ (−3,−1)(−3,−1) ⓒ (4,−4)(4,−4) ⓓ (−4,4)(−4,4) ⓔ (−4,32)(−4,32). ⓐ (−2,1)(−2,1) ⓑ (−3,−1)(−3,−1) ⓒ (4,−4)(4,−4) ⓓ (−4,4)(−4,4) ⓔ (−4,32)(−4,32) Try It 4.2 Plot each point in a rectangular coordinate system and identify the quadrant in which the point is located: ⓐ (−4,1)(−4,1) ⓑ (−2,3)(−2,3) ⓒ (2,−5)(2,−5) ⓓ (−2,5)(−2,5) ⓔ (−3,52)(−3,52). ⓐ (−4,1)(−4,1) ⓑ (−2,3)(−2,3) ⓒ (2,−5)(2,−5) ⓓ (−2,5)(−2,5) ⓔ (−3,52)(−3,52) How do the signs affect the location of the points? You may have noticed some patterns as you graphed the points in the previous example. For the point in Figure 4.3 in Quadrant IV, what do you notice about the signs of the coordinates? What about the signs of the coordinates of points in the third quadrant? The second quadrant? The first quadrant? Can you tell just by looking at the coordinates in which quadrant the point (−2,5)(−2,5) is located? In which quadrant is (2,−5)(2,−5) located? (−2,5)(−2,5) (2,−5)(2,−5) Quadrants We can summarize sign patterns of the quadrants in this way. What if one coordinate is zero as shown in Figure 4.4? Where is the point (0,4)(0,4) located? Where is the point (−2,0)(−2,0) located? (0,4)(0,4) (−2,0)(−2,0) Figure 4.4 The point (0,4)(0,4) is on the y-axis and the point (−2,0)(−2,0) is on the x-axis. (0,4)(0,4) (−2,0)(−2,0) Points on the Axes Points with a y-coordinate equal to 0 are on the x-axis, and have coordinates (a,0)(a,0). y-coordinate (a,0)(a,0) Points with an x-coordinate equal to 0 are on the y-axis, and have coordinates (0,b)(0,b). x-coordinate (0,b)(0,b) Example 4.2 Plot each point: ⓐ (0,5)(0,5) ⓑ (4,0)(4,0) ⓒ (−3,0)(−3,0) ⓓ (0,0)(0,0) ⓔ (0,−1)(0,−1). ⓐ (0,5)(0,5) ⓑ (4,0)(4,0) ⓒ (−3,0)(−3,0) ⓓ (0,0)(0,0) ⓔ (0,−1)(0,−1) Solution ⓐ ⓑ ⓒ ⓓ ⓔ Try It 4.3 Plot each point: ⓐ (4,0)(4,0) ⓑ (−2,0)(−2,0) ⓒ (0,0)(0,0) ⓓ (0,2)(0,2) ⓔ (0,−3)(0,−3). ⓐ (4,0)(4,0) ⓑ (−2,0)(−2,0) ⓒ (0,0)(0,0) ⓓ (0,2)(0,2) ⓔ (0,−3)(0,−3) Try It 4.4 Plot each point: ⓐ (−5,0)(−5,0) ⓑ (3,0)(3,0) ⓒ (0,0)(0,0) ⓓ (0,−1)(0,−1) ⓔ (0,4)(0,4). ⓐ (−5,0)(−5,0) ⓑ (3,0)(3,0) ⓒ (0,0)(0,0) ⓓ (0,−1)(0,−1) ⓔ (0,4)(0,4) In algebra, being able to identify the coordinates of a point shown on a graph is just as important as being able to plot points. To identify the x-coordinate of a point on a graph, read the number on the x-axis directly above or below the point. To identify the y-coordinate of a point, read the number on the y-axis directly to the left or right of the point. Remember, when you write the ordered pair use the correct order, (x,y)(x,y). ordered pair (x,y)(x,y) Example 4.3 Name the ordered pair of each point shown in the rectangular coordinate system. Solution Point A is above −3−3 on the x-axis, so the x-coordinate of the point is −3−3. −3−3 −3−3 Point B is below −1−1 on the x-axis, so the x-coordinate of the point is −1−1. −1−1 −1−1 Point C is above 2 on the x-axis, so the x-coordinate of the point is 2. Point D is below 4 on the x-axis, so the x-coordinate of the point is 4. Point E is on the y-axis at y=−2y=−2. The coordinates of point E are (0,−2).(0,−2). y=−2y=−2 (0,−2).(0,−2).

Page 40,"Up to now, all the equations you have solved were equations with just one variable. In almost every case, when you solved the equation you got exactly one solution. The process of solving an equation ended with a statement like x=4x=4. (Then, you checked the solution by substituting back into the equation.) x=4x=4 Here’s an example of an equation in one variable, and its one solution. But equations can have more than one variable. Equations with two variables may be of the form Ax+By=CAx+By=C. Equations of this form are called linear equations in two variables. Ax+By=CAx+By=C Linear Equation An equation of the form Ax+By=CAx+By=C, where AA and BB are not both zero, is called a linear equation in two variables. Ax+By=CAx+By=C AA BB linear equation Notice the word line in linear. Here is an example of a linear equation in two variables, xx and yy. xx yy The equation y=−3x+5y=−3x+5 is also a linear equation. But it does not appear to be in the form Ax+By=CAx+By=C. We can use the Addition Property of Equality and rewrite it in Ax+By=CAx+By=C form. y=−3x+5y=−3x+5 linear equation Ax+By=CAx+By=C Ax+By=CAx+By=C Table 4.1 By rewriting y=−3x+5y=−3x+5 as 3x+y=53x+y=5, we can easily see that it is a linear equation in two variables because it is of the form Ax+By=CAx+By=C. When an equation is in the form Ax+By=CAx+By=C, we say it is in standard form. y=−3x+5y=−3x+5 3x+y=53x+y=5 Ax+By=CAx+By=C Ax+By=CAx+By=C Standard Form of Linear Equation A linear equation is in standard form when it is written Ax+By=CAx+By=C. Ax+By=CAx+By=C Most people prefer to have AA, BB, and CC be integers and A≥0A≥0 when writing a linear equation in standard form, although it is not strictly necessary. AA BB CC A≥0A≥0 Linear equations have infinitely many solutions. For every number that is substituted for xx there is a corresponding yy value. This pair of values is a solution to the linear equation and is represented by the ordered pair (x,y)(x,y). When we substitute these values of xx and yy into the equation, the result is a true statement, because the value on the left side is equal to the value on the right side. xx yy (x,y)(x,y) xx yy Solution of a Linear Equation in Two Variables An ordered pair (x,y)(x,y) is a solution of the linear equation Ax+By=CAx+By=C, if the equation is a true statement when the x- and y-values of the ordered pair are substituted into the equation. ordered pair (x,y)(x,y) Ax+By=CAx+By=C Example 4.4 Determine which ordered pairs are solutions to the equation x+4y=8x+4y=8. x+4y=8x+4y=8 ⓐ (0,2)(0,2) ⓑ (2,−4)(2,−4) ⓒ (−4,3)(−4,3) ⓐ (0,2)(0,2) ⓑ (2,−4)(2,−4) ⓒ (−4,3)(−4,3) Solution Substitute the x- and y-values from each ordered pair into the equation and determine if the result is a true statement.

Page 40,"In the examples above, we substituted the x- and y-values of a given ordered pair to determine whether or not it was a solution to a linear equation. But how do you find the ordered pairs if they are not given? It’s easier than you might think—you can just pick a value for xx and then solve the equation for yy. Or, pick a value for yy and then solve for xx. xx yy yy xx We’ll start by looking at the solutions to the equation y=5x−1y=5x−1 that we found in Example 4.5. We can summarize this information in a table of solutions, as shown in Table 4.2. y=5x−1y=5x−1 Table 4.2 To find a third solution, we’ll let x=2x=2 and solve for yy. x=2x=2 yy The ordered pair (2,9)(2,9) is a solution to y=5x−1y=5x−1. We will add it to Table 4.3. (2,9)(2,9) y=5x−1y=5x−1 Table 4.3 We can find more solutions to the equation by substituting in any value of xx or any value of yy and solving the resulting equation to get another ordered pair that is a solution. There are infinitely many solutions of this equation. xx yy Example 4.6 Complete Table 4.4 to find three solutions to the equation y=4x−2y=4x−2. y=4x−2y=4x−2 Table 4.4 Solution Substitute x=0x=0, x=−1x=−1, and x=2x=2 into y=4x−2y=4x−2. x=0x=0 x=−1x=−1 x=2x=2 y=4x−2y=4x−2 The results are summarized in Table 4.5.

Page 40,"To find a solution to a linear equation, you really can pick any number you want to substitute into the equation for xx or y.y. But since you’ll need to use that number to solve for the other variable it’s a good idea to choose a number that’s easy to work with. xx y.y. When the equation is in y-form, with the y by itself on one side of the equation, it is usually easier to choose values of xx and then solve for yy. xx yy Example 4.8 Find three solutions to the equation y=−3x+2y=−3x+2. y=−3x+2y=−3x+2 Solution We can substitute any value we want for xx or any value for yy. Since the equation is in y-form, it will be easier to substitute in values of xx. Let’s pick x=0x=0, x=1x=1, and x=−1x=−1. xx yy xx x=0x=0 x=1x=1 x=−1x=−1 So, (0,2)(0,2), (1,−1)(1,−1) and (−1,5)(−1,5) are all solutions to y=−3x+2y=−3x+2. We show them in Table 4.8. (0,2)(0,2) (1,−1)(1,−1) (−1,5)(−1,5) y=−3x+2y=−3x+2 Table 4.8 Try It 4.15 Find three solutions to this equation: y=−2x+3y=−2x+3. y=−2x+3y=−2x+3 Try It 4.16 Find three solutions to this equation: y=−4x+1y=−4x+1. y=−4x+1y=−4x+1 We have seen how using zero as one value of xx makes finding the value of yy easy. When an equation is in standard form, with both the xx and yy on the same side of the equation, it is usually easier to first find one solution when x=0x=0 find a second solution when y=0y=0, and then find a third solution. xx yy xx yy x=0x=0 y=0y=0 Example 4.9 Find three solutions to the equation 3x+2y=63x+2y=6. 3x+2y=63x+2y=6 Solution We can substitute any value we want for xx or any value for yy. Since the equation is in standard form, let’s pick first x=0x=0, then y=0y=0, and then find a third point. xx yy x=0x=0 y=0y=0 So (0,3)(0,3), (2,0)(2,0), and (1,32)(1,32) are all solutions to the equation 3x+2y=63x+2y=6. We can list these three solutions in Table 4.9.

Page 41,"In the previous section, we found several solutions to the equation 3x+2y=63x+2y=6. They are listed in Table 4.10. So, the ordered pairs (0,3)(0,3), (2,0)(2,0), and (1,32)(1,32) are some solutions to the equation 3x+2y=63x+2y=6. We can plot these solutions in the rectangular coordinate system as shown in Figure 4.5. 3x+2y=63x+2y=6 (0,3)(0,3) (2,0)(2,0) (1,32)(1,32) 3x+2y=63x+2y=6 Table 4.10 Figure 4.5 Notice how the points line up perfectly? We connect the points with a line to get the graph of the equation 3x+2y=63x+2y=6. See Figure 4.6. Notice the arrows on the ends of each side of the line. These arrows indicate the line continues. 3x+2y=63x+2y=6 Figure 4.6 Every point on the line is a solution of the equation. Also, every solution of this equation is a point on this line. Points not on the line are not solutions. Notice that the point whose coordinates are (−2,6)(−2,6) is on the line shown in Figure 4.7. If you substitute x=−2x=−2 and y=6y=6 into the equation, you find that it is a solution to the equation. (−2,6)(−2,6) x=−2x=−2 y=6y=6 Figure 4.7 So the point (−2,6)(−2,6) is a solution to the equation 3x+2y=63x+2y=6. (The phrase “the point whose coordinates are (−2,6)(−2,6)” is often shortened to “the point (−2,6)(−2,6).”) (−2,6)(−2,6) 3x+2y=63x+2y=6 (−2,6)(−2,6) (−2,6)(−2,6) So (4,1)(4,1) is not a solution to the equation 3x+2y=63x+2y=6. Therefore, the point (4,1)(4,1) is not on the line. See Figure 4.6. This is an example of the saying, “A picture is worth a thousand words.” The line shows you all the solutions to the equation. Every point on the line is a solution of the equation. And, every solution of this equation is on this line. This line is called the graph of the equation 3x+2y=63x+2y=6.

Page 41,"There are several methods that can be used to graph a linear equation. The method we used to graph 3x+2y=63x+2y=6 is called plotting points, or the Point–Plotting Method. 3x+2y=63x+2y=6 Example 4.11 Graph the equation y=2x+1y=2x+1 by plotting points. y=2x+1y=2x+1 Solution Try It 4.21 Graph the equation by plotting points: y=2x−3y=2x−3. y=2x−3y=2x−3 Try It 4.22 Graph the equation by plotting points: y=−2x+4y=−2x+4. y=−2x+4y=−2x+4 The steps to take when graphing a linear equation by plotting points are summarized below. How To Graph a linear equation by plotting points. Step 1. Find three points whose coordinates are solutions to the equation. Organize them in a table. Step 2. Plot the points in a rectangular coordinate system. Check that the points line up. If they do not, carefully check your work. Step 3. Draw the line through the three points. Extend the line to fill the grid and put arrows on both ends of the line. It is true that it only takes two points to determine a line, but it is a good habit to use three points. If you only plot two points and one of them is incorrect, you can still draw a line but it will not represent the solutions to the equation. It will be the wrong line. If you use three points, and one is incorrect, the points will not line up. This tells you something is wrong and you need to check your work. Look at the difference between part (a) and part (b) in Figure 4.8. Figure 4.8 Let’s do another example. This time, we’ll show the last two steps all on one grid. Example 4.12 Graph the equation y=−3xy=−3x. y=−3xy=−3x Solution Find three points that are solutions to the equation. Here, again, it’s easier to choose values for xx. Do you see why? xx We list the points in Table 4.11. Table 4.11 Plot the points, check that they line up, and draw the line. Try It 4.23 Graph the equation by plotting points: y=−4xy=−4x. y=−4xy=−4x Try It 4.24 Graph the equation by plotting points: y=xy=x. y=xy=x When an equation includes a fraction as the coefficient of xx, we can still substitute any numbers for xx. But the math is easier if we make ‘good’ choices for the values of xx. This way we will avoid fraction answers, which are hard to graph precisely. xx xx xx Example 4.13 Graph the equation y=12x+3y=12x+3. y=12x+3y=12x+3 Solution Find three points that are solutions to the equation. Since this equation has the fraction 1212 as a coefficient of x,x, we will choose values of xx carefully. We will use zero as one choice and multiples of 2 for the other choices. Why are multiples of 2 a good choice for values of xx? 1212 x,x, xx xx The points are shown in Table 4.12. Table 4.12 Plot the points, check that they line up, and draw the line. Try It 4.25 Graph the equation y=13x−1y=13x−1. y=13x−1y=13x−1 Try It 4.26 Graph the equation y=14x+2y=14x+2. y=14x+2y=14x+2 So far, all the equations we graphed had yy given in terms of xx. Now we’ll graph an equation with xx and yy on the same side. Let’s see what happens in the equation 2x+y=32x+y=3. If y=0y=0 what is the value of xx? yy xx xx yy 2x+y=32x+y=3 y=0y=0 xx This point has a fraction for the x- coordinate and, while we could graph this point, it is hard to be precise graphing fractions. Remember in the example y=12x+3y=12x+3, we carefully chose values for xx so as not to graph fractions at all. If we solve the equation 2x+y=32x+y=3 for yy, it will be easier to find three solutions to the equation. y=12x+3y=12x+3 xx 2x+y=32x+y=3 yy The solutions for x=0x=0, x=1x=1, and x=−1x=−1 are shown in the Table 4.13. The graph is shown in Figure 4.9. x=0x=0 x=1x=1 x=−1x=−1 Table 4.13 Figure 4.9 Can you locate the point (32,0)(32,0), which we found by letting y=0y=0, on the line? (32,0)(32,0) y=0y=0 Example 4.14 Graph the equation 3x+y=−13x+y=−1. 3x+y=−13x+y=−1 Solution Table 4.14 We’ll let xx be 0, 1, and −1−1 to find 3 points. The ordered pairs are shown in Table 4.15. Plot the points, check that they line up, and draw the line. See Figure 4.10. xx −1−1 Table 4.15 Figure 4.10 Try It 4.27 Graph the equation 2x+y=22x+y=2. 2x+y=22x+y=2 Try It 4.28 Graph the equation 4x+y=−34x+y=−3. 4x+y=−34x+y=−3 If you can choose any three points to graph a line, how will you know if your graph matches the one shown in the answers in the book? If the points where the graphs cross the x- and y-axis are the same, the graphs match! The equation in Example 4.14 was written in standard form, with both xx and yy on the same side. We solved that equation for yy in just one step. But for other equations in standard form it is not that easy to solve for yy, so we will leave them in standard form. We can still find a first point to plot by letting x=0x=0 and solving for yy. We can plot a second point by letting y=0y=0 and then solving for xx. Then we will plot a third point by using some other value for xx or yy. xx yy yy yy x=0x=0 yy y=0y=0 xx xx yy Example 4.15 Graph the equation 2x−3y=62x−3y=6. 2x−3y=62x−3y=6 Solution Table 4.16 We list the ordered pairs in Table 4.17. Plot the points, check that they line up, and draw the line. See Figure 4.11. Table 4.17 Figure 4.11 Try It 4.29 Graph the equation 4x+2y=84x+2y=8. 4x+2y=84x+2y=8 Try It 4.30 Graph the equation 2x−4y=82x−4y=8. 2x−4y=82x−4y=8"
Page 41,"Can we graph an equation with only one variable? Just xx and no yy, or just yy without an xx? How will we make a table of values to get the points to plot? xx yy yy xx Let’s consider the equation x=−3x=−3. This equation has only one variable, xx. The equation says that xx is always equal to −3−3, so its value does not depend on yy. No matter what yy is, the value of xx is always −3−3. x=−3x=−3 xx xx −3−3 yy yy xx −3−3 So to make a table of values, write −3−3 in for all the xx values. Then choose any values for yy. Since xx does not depend on yy, you can choose any numbers you like. But to fit the points on our coordinate graph, we’ll use 1, 2, and 3 for the y-coordinates. See Table 4.18. −3−3 xx yy xx yy Table 4.18 Plot the points from Table 4.18 and connect them with a straight line. Notice in Figure 4.12 that we have graphed a vertical line. Figure 4.12 Vertical Line A vertical line is the graph of an equation of the form x=ax=a. vertical line x=ax=a The line passes through the x-axis at (a,0)(a,0). (a,0)(a,0) Example 4.16 Graph the equation x=2x=2. x=2x=2 Solution The equation has only one variable, xx, and xx is always equal to 2. We create Table 4.19 where xx is always 2 and then put in any values for yy. The graph is a vertical line passing through the x-axis at 2. See Figure 4.13. xx xx xx yy Table 4.19 Figure 4.13 Try It 4.31 Graph the equation x=5x=5. x=5x=5 Try It 4.32 Graph the equation x=−2x=−2. x=−2x=−2 What if the equation has yy but no xx? Let’s graph the equation y=4y=4. This time the y- value is a constant, so in this equation, yy does not depend on xx. Fill in 4 for all the yy’s in Table 4.20 and then choose any values for xx. We’ll use 0, 2, and 4 for the x-coordinates. yy xx y=4y=4 yy xx yy xx Table 4.20 The graph is a horizontal line passing through the y-axis at 4. See Figure 4.14. Figure 4.14 Horizontal Line A horizontal line is the graph of an equation of the form y=by=b. horizontal line y=by=b The line passes through the y-axis at (0,b)(0,b). (0,b)(0,b) Example 4.17 Graph the equation y=−1.y=−1. y=−1.y=−1. Solution The equation y=−1y=−1 has only one variable, yy. The value of yy is constant. All the ordered pairs in Table 4.21 have the same y-coordinate. The graph is a horizontal line passing through the y-axis at −1−1, as shown in Figure 4.15. y=−1y=−1 yy yy −1−1 Table 4.21 Figure 4.15 Try It 4.33 Graph the equation y=−4y=−4. y=−4y=−4 Try It 4.34 Graph the equation y=3y=3. y=3y=3 The equations for vertical and horizontal lines look very similar to equations like y=4x.y=4x. What is the difference between the equations y=4xy=4x and y=4y=4? y=4x.y=4x. y=4xy=4x y=4y=4 The equation y=4xy=4x has both xx and yy. The value of yy depends on the value of xx. The y-coordinate changes according to the value of xx. The equation y=4y=4 has only one variable. The value of yy is constant. The y-coordinate is always 4. It does not depend on the value of xx. See Table 4.22. y=4xy=4x xx yy yy xx xx y=4y=4 yy xx Table 4.22 Figure 4.16 Notice, in Figure 4.16, the equation y=4xy=4x gives a slanted line, while y=4y=4 gives a horizontal line. y=4xy=4x y=4y=4 Example 4.18 Graph y=−3xy=−3x and y=−3y=−3 in the same rectangular coordinate system. y=−3xy=−3x y=−3y=−3 Solution Notice that the first equation has the variable xx, while the second does not.

−4 . Motor home cost. The Robinsons rented a motor home for one week to go on vacation. It cost them $594 plus $0.32 per mile to rent the motor home, so the linear equation y=594+0.32xy=594+0.32x gives the cost, yy, for driving xx miles. Calculate the rental cost for driving 400, 800, and 1200 miles, and then graph the line. y=594+0.32xy=594+0.32x yy xx 136 . Weekly earnings. At the art gallery where he works, Salvador gets paid $200 per week plus 15% of the sales he makes, so the equation y=200+0.15xy=200+0.15x gives the amount, yy, he earns for selling xx dollars of artwork. Calculate the amount Salvador earns for selling $900, $1600, and $2000, and then graph the line. y=200+0.15xy=200+0.15x yy xx . Explain how you would choose three x- values to make a table to graph the line y=15x−2y=15x−2. y=15x−2y=15x−2 138 .

Page 41,". Motor home cost. The Robinsons rented a motor home for one week to go on vacation. It cost them $594 plus $0.32 per mile to rent the motor home, so the linear equation y=594+0.32xy=594+0.32x gives the cost, yy, for driving xx miles. Calculate the rental cost for driving 400, 800, and 1200 miles, and then graph the line. y=594+0.32xy=594+0.32x yy xx 136 . Weekly earnings.

Page 42,"Every linear equation can be represented by a unique line that shows all the solutions of the equation. We have seen that when graphing a line by plotting points, you can use any three solutions to graph. This means that two people graphing the line might use different sets of three points. At first glance, their two lines might not appear to be the same, since they would have different points labeled. But if all the work was done correctly, the lines should be exactly the same. One way to recognize that they are indeed the same line is to look at where the line crosses the x- axis and the y- axis. These points are called the intercepts of the line. Intercepts of a Line The points where a line crosses the x- axis and the y- axis are called the intercepts of a line. intercepts of a line Let’s look at the graphs of the lines in Figure 4.18. Figure 4.18 Examples of graphs crossing the x-negative axis. First, notice where each of these lines crosses the xx negative axis. See Figure 4.18. xx Table 4.24 Do you see a pattern? For each row, the y- coordinate of the point where the line crosses the x- axis is zero. The point where the line crosses the x- axis has the form (a,0)(a,0) and is called the x- intercept of a line. The x- intercept occurs when yy is zero. (a,0)(a,0) x- intercept of a line yy Now, let’s look at the points where these lines cross the y- axis. See Table 4.25. Table 4.25 What is the pattern here? In each row, the x- coordinate of the point where the line crosses the y- axis is zero. The point where the line crosses the y- axis has the form (0,b)(0,b) and is called the y- intercept of the line. The y- intercept occurs when xx is zero. (0,b)(0,b) xx x- intercept and y- intercept of a line y- intercept of a line The x- intercept is the point (a,0)(a,0) where the line crosses the x- axis. (a,0)(a,0) The y- intercept is the point (0,b)(0,b) where the line crosses the y- axis. (0,b)(0,b) Example 4.19 Find the x- and y- intercepts on each graph.

Page 42,"Recognizing that the x- intercept occurs when y is zero and that the y- intercept occurs when x is zero, gives us a method to find the intercepts of a line from its equation. To find the x- intercept, let y=0y=0 and solve for x. To find the y- intercept, let x=0x=0 and solve for y. x- intercept y=0y=0 y- intercept x=0x=0 Find the x- and y- Intercepts from the Equation of a Line Use the equation of the line. To find: Example 4.20 Find the intercepts of 2x+y=62x+y=6. 2x+y=62x+y=6 Solution We will let y=0y=0 to find the x- intercept, and let x=0x=0 to find the y- intercept. We will fill in the table, which reminds us of what we need to find. y=0y=0 x=0x=0 To find the x- intercept, let y=0y=0. y=0y=0 The intercepts are the points (3,0)(3,0) and (0,6)(0,6) as shown in Table 4.26.

Example 4.21 Find the intercepts of 4x–3y=124x–3y=12. 4x–3y=124x–3y=12 Solution The intercepts are the points (3, 0) and (0, −4) as shown in the following table.

Page 42,"To graph a linear equation by plotting points, you need to find three points whose coordinates are solutions to the equation. You can use the x- and y- intercepts as two of your three points. Find the intercepts, and then find a third point to ensure accuracy. Make sure the points line up—then draw the line. This method is often the quickest way to graph a line.

How To Graph a linear equation using the intercepts. Step 1. Step 2. Find a third solution to the equation. Step 3. Plot the three points and check that they line up. Step 4. Draw the line. Example 4.23 Graph 4x–3y=124x–3y=12 using the intercepts. 4x–3y=124x–3y=12 Solution Find the intercepts and a third point. We list the points in Table 4.27 and show the graph below.

It is the point (0,0)(0,0). (0,0)(0,0) To ensure accuracy we need to plot three points. Since the x- and y- intercepts are the same point, we need two more points to graph the line. See Table 4.28.

Page 43,"A geoboard is a board with a grid of pegs on it. Using rubber bands on a geoboard gives us a concrete way to model lines on a coordinate grid. By stretching a rubber band between two pegs on a geoboard, we can discover how to find the slope of a line. geoboard Manipulative Mathematics We’ll start by stretching a rubber band between two pegs as shown in Figure 4.19. Figure 4.19 Doesn’t it look like a line? Now we stretch one part of the rubber band straight up from the left peg and around a third peg to make the sides of a right triangle, as shown in Figure 4.20 Figure 4.20 We carefully make a 90º angle around the third peg, so one of the newly formed lines is vertical and the other is horizontal. To find the slope of the line, we measure the distance along the vertical and horizontal sides of the triangle. The vertical distance is called the rise and the horizontal distance is called the run, as shown in Figure 4.21. rise run Figure 4.21 If our geoboard and rubber band look just like the one shown in Figure 4.22, the rise is 2. The rubber band goes up 2 units. (Each space is one unit.) geoboard Figure 4.22 The rise on this geoboard is 2, as the rubber band goes up two units. What is the run? The rubber band goes across 3 units. The run is 3 (see Figure 4.22). The slope of a line is the ratio of the rise to the run. In mathematics, it is always referred to with the letter mm. mm Slope of a Line The slope of a line of a line is m=riserunm=riserun. slope of a line m=riserunm=riserun The rise measures the vertical change and the run measures the horizontal change between two points on the line. rise run What is the slope of the line on the geoboard in Figure 4.22? The line has slope 2323. This means that the line rises 2 units for every 3 units of run. 2323 When we work with geoboards, it is a good idea to get in the habit of starting at a peg on the left and connecting to a peg to the right. If the rise goes up it is positive and if it goes down it is negative. The run will go from left to right and be positive. Example 4.25 What is the slope of the line on the geoboard shown? Solution Use the definition of slope: m=riserun.m=riserun. m=riserun.m=riserun. Start at the left peg and count the spaces up and to the right to reach the second peg. Table 4.29 This means that the line rises 3 units for every 4 units of run. Try It 4.49 What is the slope of the line on the geoboard shown? Try It 4.50 What is the slope of the line on the geoboard shown? Example 4.26 What is the slope of the line on the geoboard shown? Solution Use the definition of slope: m=riserun.m=riserun. m=riserun.m=riserun. Start at the left peg and count the units down and to the right to reach the second peg. Table 4.30 This means that the line drops 1 unit for every 3 units of run. Try It 4.51 What is the slope of the line on the geoboard? Try It 4.52 What is the slope of the line on the geoboard? Notice that in Example 4.25 the slope is positive and in Example 4.26 the slope is negative. Do you notice any difference in the two lines shown in Figure 4.23(a) and Figure 4.23(b)? Figure 4.23 We ‘read’ a line from left to right just like we read words in English. As you read from left to right, the line in Figure 4.23(a) is going up; it has positive slope. The line in Figure 4.23(b) is going down; it has negative slope. positive slope negative slope Positive and Negative Slopes Example 4.27 Use a geoboard to model a line with slope 1212. 1212 Solution To model a line on a geoboard, we need the rise and the run. Table 4.31 So, the rise is 1 and the run is 2. Start at a peg in the lower left of the geoboard. Stretch the rubber band up 1 unit, and then right 2 units. The hypotenuse of the right triangle formed by the rubber band represents a line whose slope is 1212. 1212 Try It 4.53 Model the slope m=13m=13. Draw a picture to show your results. m=13m=13 Try It 4.54 Model the slope m=32m=32. Draw a picture to show your results. m=32m=32 Example 4.28 Use a geoboard to model a line with slope −14.−14. −14.−14. Solution Table 4.32 So, the rise is −1−1 and the run is 4. −1−1 Since the rise is negative, we choose a starting peg on the upper left that will give us room to count down. We stretch the rubber band down 1 unit, then go to the right 4 units, as shown. The hypotenuse of the right triangle formed by the rubber band represents a line whose slope is −14−14. −14−14 Try It 4.55 Model the slope m=−23m=−23. Draw a picture to show your results. m=−23m=−23 Try It 4.56 Model the slope m=−13m=−13. Draw a picture to show your results. m=−13m=−13"
Page 43,Solution Use the definition of slope: m=riserun.m=riserun. m=riserun.m=riserun. Start at the left peg and count the spaces up and to the right to reach the second peg. Table 4.29 This means that the line rises 3 units for every 4 units of run.
Page 43,"Now, we’ll look at some graphs on the xyxy-coordinate plane and see how to find their slopes. The method will be very similar to what we just modeled on our geoboards. xyxy To find the slope, we must count out the rise and the run. But where do we start? We locate two points on the line whose coordinates are integers. We then start with the point on the left and sketch a right triangle, so we can count the rise and run. Example 4.29 Find the slope of the line shown. Solution Try It 4.57 Find the slope of the line shown. Try It 4.58 Find the slope of the line shown. How To Find the slope of a line from its graph using m=riserun.m=riserun. Step 1. Locate two points on the line whose coordinates are integers. Step 2. Starting with the point on the left, sketch a right triangle, going from the first point to the second point. Step 3. Count the rise and the run on the legs of the triangle. Step 4. Take the ratio of rise to run to find the slope, m=riserunm=riserun. Example 4.30 Find the slope of the line shown. Solution So yy increases by 3 units as xx decreases by 2 units. yy xx What if we used the points (−3,7)(−3,7) and (6,1)(6,1) to find the slope of the line? (−3,7)(−3,7) (6,1)(6,1) The rise would be −6−6 and the run would be 9. Then m=−69m=−69, and that simplifies to m=−23m=−23. Remember, it does not matter which points you use—the slope of the line is always the same. −6−6 m=−69m=−69 m=−23m=−23 Try It 4.59 Find the slope of the line shown. Try It 4.60 Find the slope of the line shown. In the last two examples, the lines had y-intercepts with integer values, so it was convenient to use the y-intercept as one of the points to find the slope. In the next example, the y-intercept is a fraction. Instead of using that point, we’ll look for two other points whose coordinates are integers. This will make the slope calculations easier. Example 4.31 Find the slope of the line shown. Solution This means that yy increases 5 units as xx increases 3 units. yy xx When we used geoboards to introduce the concept of slope, we said that we would always start with the point on the left and count the rise and the run to get to the point on the right. That way the run was always positive and the rise determined whether the slope was positive or negative. What would happen if we started with the point on the right? Let’s use the points (2,3)(2,3) and (7,6)(7,6) again, but now we’ll start at (7,6)(7,6). (2,3)(2,3) (7,6)(7,6) (7,6)(7,6) Table 4.33 It does not matter where you start—the slope of the line is always the same. Try It 4.61 Find the slope of the line shown. Try It 4.62 Find the slope of the line shown."
Page 43,"Do you remember what was special about horizontal and vertical lines? Their equations had just one variable. So how do we find the slope of the horizontal line y=4y=4? One approach would be to graph the horizontal line, find two points on it, and count the rise and the run. Let’s see what happens when we do this. y=4y=4 Table 4.34 All horizontal lines have slope 0. When the y-coordinates are the same, the rise is 0. Slope of a Horizontal Line The slope of a horizontal line, y=by=b, is 0. y=by=b The floor of your room is horizontal. Its slope is 0. If you carefully placed a ball on the floor, it would not roll away. Now, we’ll consider a vertical line, the line. Table 4.35 But we can’t divide by 0. Division by 0 is not defined. So we say that the slope of the vertical line x=3x=3 is undefined. x=3x=3 The slope of any vertical line is undefined. When the x-coordinates of a line are all the same, the run is 0. Slope of a Vertical Line The slope of a vertical line, x=ax=a, is undefined. x=ax=a Example 4.32 Find the slope of each line: ⓐ x=8x=8 ⓑ y=−5y=−5. ⓐ x=8x=8 ⓑ y=−5y=−5 Solution ⓐ ⓑ Try It 4.63 Find the slope of the line: x=−4.x=−4. x=−4.x=−4. Try It 4.64 Find the slope of the line: y=7.y=7. y=7.y=7. Quick Guide to the Slopes of Lines Remember, we ‘read’ a line from left to right, just like we read written words in English."
Page 43,"Manipulative Mathematics Sometimes we’ll need to find the slope of a line between two points when we don’t have a graph to count out the rise and the run. We could plot the points on grid paper, then count out the rise and the run, but as we’ll see, there is a way to find the slope without graphing. Before we get to it, we need to introduce some algebraic notation. We have seen that an ordered pair (x,y)(x,y) gives the coordinates of a point. But when we work with slopes, we use two points. How can the same symbol (x,y)(x,y) be used to represent two different points? Mathematicians use subscripts to distinguish the points. (x,y)(x,y) (x,y)(x,y) The use of subscripts in math is very much like the use of last name initials in elementary school. Maybe you remember Laura C. and Laura M. in your third grade class? We will use (x1,y1)(x1,y1) to identify the first point and (x2,y2)(x2,y2) to identify the second point. (x1,y1)(x1,y1) (x2,y2)(x2,y2) If we had more than two points, we could use (x3,y3)(x3,y3), (x4,y4)(x4,y4), and so on. (x3,y3)(x3,y3) (x4,y4)(x4,y4) Let’s see how the rise and run relate to the coordinates of the two points by taking another look at the slope of the line between the points (2,3)(2,3) and (7,6)(7,6). (2,3)(2,3) (7,6)(7,6) Since we have two points, we will use subscript notation, (2,x1,3y1)(2,x1,3y1)(7,6x2,y2)(7,6x2,y2). (2,x1,3y1)(2,x1,3y1) (7,6x2,y2)(7,6x2,y2) On the graph, we counted the rise of 3 and the run of 5. Notice that the rise of 3 can be found by subtracting the y-coordinates 6 and 3. And the run of 5 can be found by subtracting the x-coordinates 7 and 2. We know m=riserunm=riserun. So m=35m=35. m=riserunm=riserun m=35m=35 We rewrite the rise and run by putting in the coordinates m=6−37−2m=6−37−2. m=6−37−2m=6−37−2 But 6 is y2y2, the y-coordinate of the second point and 3 is y1y1, the y-coordinate of the first point. y2y2 y1y1 So we can rewrite the slope using subscript notation. m=y2−y17−2m=y2−y17−2 m=y2−y17−2m=y2−y17−2 Also, 7 is x2x2, the x-coordinate of the second point and 2 is x1x1, the x-coordinate of the first point. x2x2 x1x1 So, again, we rewrite the slope using subscript notation.	m=y2−y1x2−x1m=y2−y1x2−x1 m=y2−y1x2−x1m=y2−y1x2−x1 We’ve shown that m=y2−y1x2−x1m=y2−y1x2−x1 is really another version of m=riserunm=riserun. We can use this formula to find the slope of a line when we have two points on the line. m=y2−y1x2−x1m=y2−y1x2−x1 m=riserunm=riserun Slope Formula The slope of the line between two points (x1,y1)(x1,y1) and (x2,y2)(x2,y2) is (x1,y1)(x1,y1) (x2,y2)(x2,y2) This is the slope formula. slope formula The slope is: Example 4.33 Use the slope formula to find the slope of the line between the points (1,2)(1,2) and (4,5)(4,5). slope formula (1,2)(1,2) (4,5)(4,5) Solution Table 4.36 Let’s confirm this by counting out the slope on a graph using m=riserunm=riserun. m=riserunm=riserun It doesn’t matter which point you call point #1 and which one you call point #2. The slope will be the same. Try the calculation yourself. Try It 4.65 Use the slope formula to find the slope of the line through the points: (8,5)(8,5) and (6,3)(6,3). (8,5)(8,5) (6,3)(6,3) Try It 4.66 Use the slope formula to find the slope of the line through the points: (1,5)(1,5) and (5,9)(5,9). (1,5)(1,5) (5,9)(5,9) Example 4.34 Use the slope formula to find the slope of the line through the points (−2,−3)(−2,−3) and (−7,4)(−7,4). (−2,−3)(−2,−3) (−7,4)(−7,4) Solution Table 4.37 Let’s verify this slope on the graph shown. Try It 4.67 Use the slope formula to find the slope of the line through the points: (−3,4)(−3,4) and (2,−1).(2,−1). (−3,4)(−3,4) (2,−1).(2,−1).

Page 43,"Up to now, in this chapter, we have graphed lines by plotting points, by using intercepts, and by recognizing horizontal and vertical lines. One other method we can use to graph lines is called the point–slope method. We will use this method when we know one point and the slope of the line. We will start by plotting the point and then use the definition of slope to draw the graph of the line. point–slope method Example 4.35 Graph the line passing through the point (1,−1)(1,−1) whose slope is m=34m=34. (1,−1)(1,−1) m=34m=34 Solution Try It 4.69 Graph the line passing through the point (2,−2)(2,−2) with the slope m=43m=43.

Plot the given point. Step 2. Use the slope formula m=riserunm=riserun to identify the rise and the run. Step 3. Starting at the given point, count out the rise and run to mark the second point. Step 4. Connect the points with a line. Example 4.36 Graph the line with y-intercept 2 whose slope is m=−23m=−23. m=−23m=−23 Solution Plot the given point, the y-intercept, (0,2)(0,2). (0,2)(0,2) Table 4.38 Count the rise and the run. Mark the second point. Connect the two points with a line. You can check your work by finding a third point. Since the slope is m=−23m=−23, it can be written as m=2−3m=2−3. Go back to (0,2)(0,2) and count out the rise, 2, and the run, −3−3. m=−23m=−23 m=2−3m=2−3 (0,2)(0,2) −3−3 Try It 4.71 Graph the line with the y-intercept 4 and slope m=−52.m=−52. m=−52.m=−52.

(−1,−3)(−1,−3) m=4.m=4. Solution Plot the given point. Table 4.39 Count the rise and run and mark the second point. Connect the two points with a line. You can check your work by finding a third point. Since the slope is m=4m=4, it can be written as m=−4−1m=−4−1. Go back to (−1,−3)(−1,−3) and count out the rise, −4−4, and the run, −1−1. m=4m=4 m=−4−1m=−4−1 (−1,−3)(−1,−3) −4−4 −1−1 Try It 4.73 Graph the line with the point (−2,1)(−2,1) and slope m=3m=3.

Page 43,"At the beginning of this section, we said there are many applications of slope in the real world. Let’s look at a few now. Example 4.38 The ‘pitch’ of a building’s roof is the slope of the roof. Knowing the pitch is important in climates where there is heavy snowfall. If the roof is too flat, the weight of the snow may cause it to collapse. What is the slope of the roof shown? Solution Table 4.40 Try It 4.75 Use Example 4.38, substituting the rise = 14 and run = 24. Try It 4.76 Use Example 4.38, substituting rise = 15 and run = 36. Example 4.39 Have you ever thought about the sewage pipes going from your house to the street? They must slope down 1414 inch per foot in order to drain properly. What is the required slope? 1414 Solution The pipe drops 1 inch for every 48 inches of horizontal run. Try It 4.77 Find the slope of a pipe that slopes down 1313 inch per foot. 1313 Try It 4.78 Find the slope of a pipe that slopes down 3434 inch per yard. 3434 Media Access these online resources for additional instruction and practice with understanding slope of a line."

An easy way to determine the slope of a roof is to set one end of a 12 inch level on the roof surface and hold it level. Then take a tape measure or ruler and measure from the other end of the level down to the roof surface. This will give you the slope of the roof. Builders, sometimes, refer to this as pitch and state it as an “xx 12 pitch” meaning x12x12, where xx is the measurement from the roof to the level—the rise. It is also sometimes stated as an “xx-in-12 pitch”. xx x12x12 xx xx ⓐ ⓑ 280 . The slope of the roof shown here is measured with a 12” level and a ruler. What is the slope of this roof? . Road grade. A local road has a grade of 6%. The grade of a road is its slope expressed as a percent. Find the slope of the road as a fraction and then simplify. What rise and run would reflect this slope or grade? 282 . Highway grade. A local road rises 2 feet for every 50 feet of highway. ⓐ ⓑ . Wheelchair ramp. The rules for wheelchair ramps require a maximum 1-inch rise for a 12-inch run. ⓐ ⓑ 284 . Wheelchair ramp. A 1-inch rise for a 16-inch run makes it easier for the wheelchair rider to ascend a ramp. ⓐ ⓑ . What does the sign of the slope tell you about a line? 286 . How does the graph of a line with slope m=12m=12 differ from the graph of a line with slope m=2m=2? m=12m=12 m=2m=2 . Why is the slope of a vertical line “undefined”? ⓐ After completing the exercises, use this checklist to evaluate your mastery of the objectives of this section. ⓐ ⓑ On a scale of 1–10, how would you rate your mastery of this section in light of your responses on the checklist? How can you improve this? ⓑ"

Page 43,". Slope of a roof. An easy way to determine the slope of a roof is to set one end of a 12 inch level on the roof surface and hold it level. Then take a tape measure or ruler and measure from the other end of the level down to the roof surface. This will give you the slope of the roof. Builders, sometimes, refer to this as pitch and state it as an “xx 12 pitch” meaning x12x12, where xx is the measurement from the roof to the level—the rise. It is also sometimes stated as an “xx-in-12 pitch”. xx x12x12 xx xx ⓐ ⓑ 280 . The slope of the roof shown here is measured with a 12” level and a ruler. What is the slope of this roof? . Road grade.

Page 44,"We have graphed linear equations by plotting points, using intercepts, recognizing horizontal and vertical lines, and using the point–slope method. Once we see how an equation in slope–intercept form and its graph are related, we’ll have one more method we can use to graph lines. In Graph Linear Equations in Two Variables, we graphed the line of the equation y=12x+3y=12x+3 by plotting points. See Figure 4.24. Let’s find the slope of this line. y=12x+3y=12x+3 Figure 4.24 The red lines show us the rise is 1 and the run is 2. Substituting into the slope formula: What is the y-intercept of the line? The y-intercept is where the line crosses the y-axis, so y-intercept is (0,3)(0,3). The equation of this line is: (0,3)(0,3) Notice, the line has: When a linear equation is solved for yy, the coefficient of the xx term is the slope and the constant term is the y-coordinate of the y-intercept. We say that the equation y=12x+3y=12x+3 is in slope–intercept form. yy xx y=12x+3y=12x+3 Slope-Intercept Form of an Equation of a Line The slope–intercept form of an equation of a line with slope mm and y-intercept, (0,b)(0,b) is, slope–intercept form mm (0,b)(0,b) Sometimes the slope–intercept form is called the “y-form.” Example 4.40 Use the graph to find the slope and y-intercept of the line, y=2x+1y=2x+1. y=2x+1y=2x+1 Compare these values to the equationy=mx+by=mx+b. y=mx+by=mx+b Solution To find the slope of the line, we need to choose two points on the line. We’ll use the points (0,1)(0,1) and (1,3)(1,3). (0,1)(0,1) (1,3)(1,3) The slope is the same as the coefficient of xx and the y-coordinate of the y-intercept is the same as the constant term. xx Try It 4.79 Use the graph to find the slope and y-intercept of the line y=23x−1y=23x−1.

Page 44,"In Understand Slope of a Line, we graphed a line using the slope and a point. When we are given an equation in slope–intercept form, we can use the y-intercept as the point, and then count out the slope from there. Let’s practice finding the values of the slope and y-intercept from the equation of a line.

See Figure 4.25. Figure 4.25"
Page 44,"Now that we have seen several methods we can use to graph lines, how do we know which method to use for a given equation? While we could plot points, use the slope–intercept form, or find the intercepts for any equation, if we recognize the most convenient way to graph a certain type of equation, our work will be easier. Generally, plotting points is not the most efficient way to graph a line. We saw better methods in sections 4.3, 4.4, and earlier in this section. Let’s look for some patterns to help determine the most convenient method to graph a line. Here are six equations we graphed in this chapter, and the method we used to graph each of them. Equations #1 and #2 each have just one variable. Remember, in equations of this form the value of that one variable is constant; it does not depend on the value of the other variable. Equations of this form have graphs that are vertical or horizontal lines. In equations #3 and #4, both xx and yy are on the same side of the equation. These two equations are of the form Ax+By=CAx+By=C. We substituted y=0y=0 to find the x-intercept and x=0x=0 to find the y-intercept, and then found a third point by choosing another value for xx or yy. xx yy Ax+By=CAx+By=C y=0y=0 x=0x=0 xx yy Equations #5 and #6 are written in slope–intercept form. After identifying the slope and y-intercept from the equation we used them to graph the line. This leads to the following strategy. Strategy for Choosing the Most Convenient Method to Graph a Line Consider the form of the equation.

Page 44,"Many real-world applications are modeled by linear equations. We will take a look at a few applications here so you can see how equations written in slope–intercept form relate to real-world situations. Usually when a linear equation models a real-world situation, different letters are used for the variables, instead of x and y. The variable names remind us of what quantities are being measured. Example 4.49 The equation F=95C+32F=95C+32 is used to convert temperatures, CC, on the Celsius scale to temperatures, FF, on the Fahrenheit scale.

It is for the material and labor needed to produce each item. Example 4.50 Stella has a home business selling gourmet pizzas.

Page 44,"The slope of a line indicates how steep the line is and whether it rises or falls as we read it from left to right. Two lines that have the same slope are called parallel lines. Parallel lines never intersect. We say this more formally in terms of the rectangular coordinate system. Two lines that have the same slope and different y-intercepts are called parallel lines. See Figure 4.27. parallel lines Figure 4.27 Verify that both lines have the same slope, m=25m=25, and different y-intercepts. What about vertical lines? The slope of a vertical line is undefined, so vertical lines don’t fit in the definition above. We say that vertical lines that have different x-intercepts are parallel. See Figure 4.28. Figure 4.28 Vertical lines with diferent x-intercepts are parallel. Parallel Lines Parallel lines are lines in the same plane that do not intersect. Let’s graph the equations y=−2x+3y=−2x+3 and 2x+y=−12x+y=−1 on the same grid. The first equation is already in slope–intercept form: y=−2x+3y=−2x+3. We solve the second equation for yy: y=−2x+3y=−2x+3 2x+y=−12x+y=−1 y=−2x+3y=−2x+3 yy Graph the lines. Notice the lines look parallel. What is the slope of each line? What is the y-intercept of each line? The slopes of the lines are the same and the y-intercept of each line is different. So we know these lines are parallel. Since parallel lines have the same slope and different y-intercepts, we can now just look at the slope–intercept form of the equations of lines and decide if the lines are parallel. Example 4.51 Use slopes and y-intercepts to determine if the lines 3x−2y=63x−2y=6 and y=32x+1y=32x+1 are parallel. 3x−2y=63x−2y=6 y=32x+1y=32x+1 Solution Table 4.42 The lines have the same slope and different y-intercepts and so they are parallel. You may want to graph the lines to confirm whether they are parallel. Try It 4.101 Use slopes and y-intercepts to determine if the lines 2x+5y=5andy=−25x−42x+5y=5andy=−25x−4 are parallel. 2x+5y=5andy=−25x−42x+5y=5andy=−25x−4 Try It 4.102 Use slopes and y-intercepts to determine if the lines 4x−3y=6andy=43x−14x−3y=6andy=43x−1 are parallel. 4x−3y=6andy=43x−14x−3y=6andy=43x−1 Example 4.52 Use slopes and y-intercepts to determine if the lines y=−4y=−4 and y=3y=3 are parallel. y=−4y=−4 y=3y=3 Solution Table 4.43 The lines have the same slope and different y-intercepts and so they are parallel. There is another way you can look at this example. If you recognize right away from the equations that these are horizontal lines, you know their slopes are both 0. Since the horizontal lines cross the y-axis at y=−4y=−4 and at y=3y=3, we know the y-intercepts are (0,−4)(0,−4) and (0,3)(0,3). The lines have the same slope and different y-intercepts and so they are parallel. y=−4y=−4 y=3y=3 (0,−4)(0,−4) (0,3)(0,3) Try It 4.103 Use slopes and y-intercepts to determine if the lines y=8andy=−6y=8andy=−6 are parallel. y=8andy=−6y=8andy=−6 Try It 4.104 Use slopes and y-intercepts to determine if the lines y=1andy=−5y=1andy=−5 are parallel. y=1andy=−5y=1andy=−5 Example 4.53 Use slopes and y-intercepts to determine if the lines x=−2x=−2 and x=−5x=−5 are parallel. x=−2x=−2 x=−5x=−5 Solution Since there is noyy, the equations cannot be put in slope–intercept form. But we recognize them as equations of vertical lines. Their x-intercepts are −2−2 and −5−5. Since their x-intercepts are different, the vertical lines are parallel. yy −2−2 −5−5 Try It 4.105 Use slopes and y-intercepts to determine if the lines x=1x=1 and x=−5x=−5 are parallel. x=1x=1 x=−5x=−5 Try It 4.106 Use slopes and y-intercepts to determine if the lines x=8x=8 and x=−6x=−6 are parallel. x=8x=8 x=−6x=−6 Example 4.54 Use slopes and y-intercepts to determine if the lines y=2x−3y=2x−3 and −6x+3y=−9−6x+3y=−9 are parallel. You may want to graph these lines, too, to see what they look like. y=2x−3y=2x−3 −6x+3y=−9−6x+3y=−9 Solution Table 4.44 The lines have the same slope, but they also have the same y-intercepts.

Page 44,"Let’s look at the lines whose equations are y=14x−1y=14x−1 and y=−4x+2y=−4x+2, shown in Figure 4.29. y=14x−1y=14x−1 y=−4x+2y=−4x+2 Figure 4.29 These lines lie in the same plane and intersect in right angles. We call these lines perpendicular. perpendicular What do you notice about the slopes of these two lines? As we read from left to right, the line y=14x−1y=14x−1 rises, so its slope is positive. The liney=−4x+2y=−4x+2 drops from left to right, so it has a negative slope. Does it make sense to you that the slopes of two perpendicular lines will have opposite signs? y=14x−1y=14x−1 y=−4x+2y=−4x+2 If we look at the slope of the first line, m1=14m1=14, and the slope of the second line, m2=−4m2=−4, we can see that they are negative reciprocals of each other. If we multiply them, their product is −1.−1. m1=14m1=14 m2=−4m2=−4 −1.−1. This is always true for perpendicular lines and leads us to this definition. perpendicular lines Perpendicular Lines Perpendicular lines are lines in the same plane that form a right angle. If m1andm2m1andm2 are the slopes of two perpendicular lines, then: m1andm2m1andm2 Vertical lines and horizontal lines are always perpendicular to each other. We were able to look at the slope–intercept form of linear equations and determine whether or not the lines were parallel. We can do the same thing for perpendicular lines. We find the slope–intercept form of the equation, and then see if the slopes are negative reciprocals. If the product of the slopes is −1−1, the lines are perpendicular. Perpendicular lines may have the same y-intercepts. −1−1 Example 4.55 Use slopes to determine if the lines, y=−5x−4y=−5x−4 and x−5y=5x−5y=5 are perpendicular. y=−5x−4y=−5x−4 x−5y=5x−5y=5 Solution The slopes are negative reciprocals of each other, so the lines are perpendicular. We check by multiplying the slopes, Try It 4.109 Use slopes to determine if the lines y=−3x+2y=−3x+2 and x−3y=4x−3y=4 are perpendicular. y=−3x+2y=−3x+2 x−3y=4x−3y=4 Try It 4.110 Use slopes to determine if the lines y=2x−5y=2x−5 and x+2y=−6x+2y=−6 are perpendicular. y=2x−5y=2x−5 x+2y=−6x+2y=−6 Example 4.56 Use slopes to determine if the lines, 7x+2y=37x+2y=3 and 2x+7y=52x+7y=5 are perpendicular. 7x+2y=37x+2y=3 2x+7y=52x+7y=5 Solution Table 4.45 The slopes are reciprocals of each other, but they have the same sign. Since they are not negative reciprocals, the lines are not perpendicular. Try It 4.111 Use slopes to determine if the lines 5x+4y=15x+4y=1 and 4x+5y=34x+5y=3 are perpendicular. 5x+4y=15x+4y=1 4x+5y=34x+5y=3 Try It 4.112 Use slopes to determine if the lines 2x−9y=32x−9y=3 and 9x−2y=19x−2y=1 are perpendicular. 2x−9y=32x−9y=3 9x−2y=19x−2y=1 Media Access this online resource for additional instruction and practice with graphs."

Example 4.57 Find an equation of a line with slope −7−7 and y-intercept (0,−1)(0,−1). −7−7 (0,−1)(0,−1) Solution Since we are given the slope and y-intercept of the line, we can substitute the needed values into the slope–intercept form, y=mx+by=mx+b. y=mx+by=mx+b Try It 4.113 Find an equation of a line with slope 2525 and y-intercept (0,4)(0,4). 2525 (0,4)(0,4) Try It 4.114 Find an equation of a line with slope −1−1 and y-intercept (0,−3)(0,−3). −1−1 (0,−3)(0,−3) Sometimes, the slope and intercept need to be determined from the graph.

Page 45,"Finding an equation of a line using the slope–intercept form of the equation works well when you are given the slope and y-intercept or when you read them off a graph. But what happens when you have another point instead of the y-intercept? We are going to use the slope formula to derive another form of an equation of the line. Suppose we have a line that has slope mm and that contains some specific point (x1,y1)(x1,y1) and some other point, which we will just call (x,y)(x,y). We can write the slope of this line and then change it to a different form. mm (x1,y1)(x1,y1) (x,y)(x,y) Table 4.46 This format is called the point–slope form of an equation of a line. Point–slope Form of an Equation of a Line The point–slope form of an equation of a line with slope mm and containing the point (x1,y1)(x1,y1) is point–slope form mm (x1,y1)(x1,y1) We can use the point–slope form of an equation to find an equation of a line when we are given the slope and one point. Then we will rewrite the equation in slope–intercept form. Most applications of linear equations use the the slope–intercept form. Example 4.59 Find an equation of a line with slope m=25m=25 that contains the point (10,3)(10,3). Write the equation in slope–intercept form. m=25m=25 (10,3)(10,3) Solution Try It 4.117 Find an equation of a line with slope m=56m=56 and containing the point (6,3)(6,3). m=56m=56 (6,3)(6,3) Try It 4.118 Find an equation of a line with slope m=23m=23 and containing thepoint (9,2)(9,2). m=23m=23 (9,2)(9,2) How To Find an equation of a line given the slope and a point.

Write the equation in slope–intercept form. m=−13m=−13 (6,−4)(6,−4) Solution Since we are given a point and the slope of the line, we can substitute the needed values into the point–slope form, y−y1=m(x−x1)y−y1=m(x−x1). y−y1=m(x−x1)y−y1=m(x−x1) Try It 4.119 Find an equation of a line with slope m=−25m=−25 and containing the point (10,−5)(10,−5). m=−25m=−25 (10,−5)(10,−5) Try It 4.120 Find an equation of a line with slope m=−34m=−34, and containing the point (4,−7)(4,−7). m=−34m=−34 (4,−7)(4,−7) Example 4.61 Find an equation of a horizontal line that contains the point (−1,2)(−1,2). Write the equation in slope–intercept form. (−1,2)(−1,2) Solution Every horizontal line has slope 0.

Page 45,"When real-world data is collected, a linear model can be created from two data points. In the next example we’ll see how to find an equation of a line when just two points are given. We have two options so far for finding an equation of a line: slope–intercept or point–slope. Since we will know two points, it will make more sense to use the point–slope form. But then we need the slope. Can we find the slope with just two points? Yes. Then, once we have the slope, we can use it and one of the given points to find the equation. Example 4.62 Find an equation of a line that contains the points (5,4)(5,4) and (3,6)(3,6). Write the equation in slope–intercept form. (5,4)(5,4) (3,6)(3,6) Solution Use the point (3,6)(3,6) and see that you get the same equation. (3,6)(3,6) Try It 4.123 Find an equation of a line containing the points (3,1)(3,1) and (5,6)(5,6).

Find the slope using the given points. Step 2. Choose one point. Step 3. Substitute the values into the point-slope form, y−y1=m(x−x1)y−y1=m(x−x1). Step 4. Write the equation in slope–intercept form. Example 4.63 Find an equation of a line that contains the points (−3,−1)(−3,−1) and (2,−2)(2,−2). Write the equation in slope–intercept form. (−3,−1)(−3,−1) (2,−2)(2,−2) Solution Since we have two points, we will find an equation of the line using the point–slope form. The first step will be to find the slope. Try It 4.125 Find an equation of a line containing the points (−2,−4)(−2,−4) and (1,−3)(1,−3). (−2,−4)(−2,−4) (1,−3)(1,−3) Try It 4.126 Find an equation of a line containing the points (−4,−3)(−4,−3) and (1,−5)(1,−5). (−4,−3)(−4,−3) (1,−5)(1,−5) Example 4.64 Find an equation of a line that contains the points (−2,4)(−2,4) and (−2,−3)(−2,−3). Write the equation in slope–intercept form. (−2,4)(−2,4) (−2,−3)(−2,−3) Solution Again, the first step will be to find the slope. This tells us it is a vertical line. Both of our points have an x-coordinate of −2−2. So our equation of the line is x=−2x=−2. Since there is no yy, we cannot write it in slope–intercept form. −2−2 x=−2x=−2 yy You may want to sketch a graph using the two given points. Does the graph agree with our conclusion that this is a vertical line? Try It 4.127 Find an equation of a line containing the points (5,1)(5,1) and (5,−4)(5,−4).

(−4,4)(−4,4) (−4,3)(−4,3) We have seen that we can use either the slope–intercept form or the point–slope form to find an equation of a line. Which form we use will depend on the information we are given. This is summarized in Table 4.47. Table 4.47"
Page 45,"Suppose we need to find an equation of a line that passes through a specific point and is parallel to a given line. We can use the fact that parallel lines have the same slope. So we will have a point and the slope—just what we need to use the point–slope equation. First let’s look at this graphically. The graph shows the graph of y=2x−3y=2x−3. We want to graph a line parallel to this line and passing through the point (−2,1)(−2,1). y=2x−3y=2x−3 (−2,1)(−2,1) We know that parallel lines have the same slope. So the second line will have the same slope asy=2x−3y=2x−3. That slope ism∥=2m∥=2. We’ll use the notation m∥m∥ to represent the slope of a line parallel to a line with slope mm. (Notice that the subscript ∥∥ looks like two parallel lines.) y=2x−3y=2x−3 m∥=2m∥=2 m∥m∥ mm ∥∥ The second line will pass through (−2,1)(−2,1) and have m=2m=2. To graph the line, we start at(−2,1)(−2,1) and count out the rise and run. With m=2m=2 (or m=21m=21), we count out the rise 2 and the run 1. We draw the line. (−2,1)(−2,1) m=2m=2 (−2,1)(−2,1) m=2m=2 m=21m=21 Do the lines appear parallel? Does the second line pass through (−2,1)(−2,1)? (−2,1)(−2,1) Now, let’s see how to do this algebraically. We can use either the slope–intercept form or the point–slope form to find an equation of a line. Here we know one point and can find the slope. So we will use the point–slope form. Example 4.65 Find an equation of a line parallel to y=2x−3y=2x−3 that contains the point (−2,1)(−2,1). Write the equation in slope–intercept form. y=2x−3y=2x−3 (−2,1)(−2,1) Solution Does this equation make sense? What is the y-intercept of the line? What is the slope? Try It 4.129 Find an equation of a line parallel to the line y=3x+1y=3x+1 that contains the point (4,2)(4,2). Write the equation in slope–intercept form. y=3x+1y=3x+1 (4,2)(4,2) Try It 4.130 Find an equation of a line parallel to the line y=12x−3y=12x−3 that contains the point (6,4)(6,4). y=12x−3y=12x−3 (6,4)(6,4) How To Find an equation of a line parallel to a given line. Step 1. Find the slope of the given line. Step 2. Find the slope of the parallel line. Step 3. Identify the point. Step 4. Substitute the values into the point–slope form, y−y1=m(x−x1)y−y1=m(x−x1). Step 5. Write the equation in slope–intercept form."
Page 45,"Now, let’s consider perpendicular lines. Suppose we need to find a line passing through a specific point and which is perpendicular to a given line. We can use the fact that perpendicular lines have slopes that are negative reciprocals. We will again use the point–slope equation, like we did with parallel lines. The graph shows the graph of y=2x−3y=2x−3. Now, we want to graph a line perpendicular to this line and passing through (−2,1)(−2,1). y=2x−3y=2x−3 (−2,1)(−2,1) We know that perpendicular lines have slopes that are negative reciprocals. We’ll use the notation m⊥m⊥ to represent the slope of a line perpendicular to a line with slope mm. (Notice that the subscript ⊥ looks like the right angles made by two perpendicular lines.) m⊥m⊥ mm We now know the perpendicular line will pass through (−2,1)(−2,1) with m⊥=−12m⊥=−12. (−2,1)(−2,1) m⊥=−12m⊥=−12 To graph the line, we will start at (−2,1)(−2,1) and count out the rise −1−1 and the run 2. Then we draw the line. (−2,1)(−2,1) −1−1 Do the lines appear perpendicular? Does the second line pass through (−2,1)(−2,1)? (−2,1)(−2,1) Now, let’s see how to do this algebraically. We can use either the slope–intercept form or the point–slope form to find an equation of a line. In this example we know one point, and can find the slope, so we will use the point–slope form. Example 4.66 Find an equation of a line perpendicular to y=2x−3y=2x−3 that contains the point (−2,1)(−2,1). Write the equation in slope–intercept form. y=2x−3y=2x−3 (−2,1)(−2,1) Solution Try It 4.131 Find an equation of a line perpendicular to the line y=3x+1y=3x+1 that contains the point (4,2)(4,2). Write the equation in slope–intercept form. y=3x+1y=3x+1 (4,2)(4,2) Try It 4.132 Find an equation of a line perpendicular to the line y=12x−3y=12x−3 that contains the point (6,4)(6,4). y=12x−3y=12x−3 (6,4)(6,4) How To Find an equation of a line perpendicular to a given line. Step 1. Find the slope of the given line. Step 2. Find the slope of the perpendicular line. Step 3. Identify the point. Step 4. Substitute the values into the point–slope form, y−y1=m(x−x1)y−y1=m(x−x1). Step 5. Write the equation in slope–intercept form. Example 4.67 Find an equation of a line perpendicular to x=5x=5 that contains the point (3,−2)(3,−2). Write the equation in slope–intercept form. x=5x=5 (3,−2)(3,−2) Solution Again, since we know one point, the point–slope option seems more promising than the slope–intercept option. We need the slope to use this form, and we know the new line will be perpendicular to x=5x=5. This line is vertical, so its perpendicular will be horizontal. This tells us the m⊥=0m⊥=0. x=5x=5 m⊥=0m⊥=0 Sketch the graph of both lines. Do they appear to be perpendicular? Try It 4.133 Find an equation of a line that is perpendicular to the line x=4x=4 that contains the point (4,−5)(4,−5). Write the equation in slope–intercept form. x=4x=4 (4,−5)(4,−5) Try It 4.134 Find an equation of a line that is perpendicular to the line x=2x=2 that contains the point (2,−1)(2,−1). Write the equation in slope–intercept form. x=2x=2 (2,−1)(2,−1) In Example 4.67, we used the point–slope form to find the equation. We could have looked at this in a different way. We want to find a line that is perpendicular to x=5x=5 that contains the point (3,−2)(3,−2). The graph shows us the linex=5x=5 and the point (3,−2)(3,−2). x=5x=5 (3,−2)(3,−2) x=5x=5 (3,−2)(3,−2) We know every line perpendicular to a vetical line is horizontal, so we will sketch the horizontal line through (3,−2)(3,−2). (3,−2)(3,−2) Do the lines appear perpendicular? If we look at a few points on this horizontal line, we notice they all have y-coordinates of −2−2. So, the equation of the line perpendicular to the vertical line x=5x=5 is y=−2y=−2. −2−2 x=5x=5 y=−2y=−2 Example 4.68 Find an equation of a line that is perpendicular to y=−4y=−4 that contains the point (−4,2)(−4,2). Write the equation in slope–intercept form. y=−4y=−4 (−4,2)(−4,2) Solution The line y=−4y=−4 is a horizontal line. Any line perpendicular to it must be vertical, in the form x=ax=a. Since the perpendicular line is vertical and passes through (−4,2)(−4,2), every point on it has an x-coordinate of −4−4. The equation of the perpendicular line is x=−4x=−4. You may want to sketch the lines. Do they appear perpendicular? y=−4y=−4 x=ax=a (−4,2)(−4,2) −4−4 x=−4x=−4 Try It 4.135 Find an equation of a line that is perpendicular to the line y=1y=1 that contains the point (−5,1)(−5,1).

Page 46,"We have learned how to solve inequalities in one variable. Now, we will look at inequalities in two variables. Inequalities in two variables have many applications. If you ran a business, for example, you would want your revenue to be greater than your costs—so that your business would make a profit. Linear Inequality A linear inequality is an inequality that can be written in one of the following forms: linear inequality where AandBAandB are not both zero. AandBAandB Do you remember that an inequality with one variable had many solutions? The solution to the inequality x>3x>3 is any number greater than 3. We showed this on the number line by shading in the number line to the right of 3, and putting an open parenthesis at 3. See Figure 4.30. x>3x>3 Figure 4.30 Similarly, inequalities in two variables have many solutions. Any ordered pair (x,y)(x,y) that makes the inequality true when we substitute in the values is a solution of the inequality. (x,y)(x,y) Solution of a Linear Inequality An ordered pair (x,y)(x,y) is a solution of a linear inequality if the inequality is true when we substitute the values of x and y.

Page 46,"Now, we will look at how the solutions of an inequality relate to its graph. Let’s think about the number line in Figure 4.30 again. The point x=3x=3 separated that number line into two parts. On one side of 3 are all the numbers less than 3. On the other side of 3 all the numbers are greater than 3. See Figure 4.31. x=3x=3 Figure 4.31 The solution to x>3x>3 is the shaded part of the number line to the right of x=3x=3. x>3x>3 x=3x=3 Similarly, the line y=x+4y=x+4 separates the plane into two regions. On one side of the line are points with y<x+4y<x+4. On the other side of the line are the points with y>x+4y>x+4. We call the line y=x+4y=x+4 a boundary line. y=x+4y=x+4 y<x+4y<x+4 y>x+4y>x+4 y=x+4y=x+4 Boundary Line The line with equation Ax+By=CAx+By=C is the boundary line that separates the region where Ax+By>CAx+By>C from the region where Ax+By<CAx+By<C. Ax+By=CAx+By=C boundary line Ax+By>CAx+By>C Ax+By<CAx+By<C For an inequality in one variable, the endpoint is shown with a parenthesis or a bracket depending on whether or not aa is included in the solution: aa Similarly, for an inequality in two variables, the boundary line is shown with a solid or dashed line to indicate whether or not it the line is included in the solution. This is summarized in Table 4.48 Table 4.48 Now, let’s take a look at what we found in Example 4.69. We’ll start by graphing the line y=x+4y=x+4, and then we’ll plot the five points we tested. See Figure 4.32. y=x+4y=x+4 Figure 4.32 In Example 4.69 we found that some of the points were solutions to the inequality y>x+4y>x+4 and some were not. y>x+4y>x+4 Which of the points we plotted are solutions to the inequality y>x+4y>x+4? The points (1,6)(1,6) and (−8,12)(−8,12) are solutions to the inequality y>x+4y>x+4. Notice that they are both on the same side of the boundary line y=x+4y=x+4. y>x+4y>x+4 (1,6)(1,6) (−8,12)(−8,12) y>x+4y>x+4 y=x+4y=x+4 The two points (0,0)(0,0) and (−5,−15)(−5,−15) are on the other side of the boundary line y=x+4y=x+4, and they are not solutions to the inequality y>x+4y>x+4. For those two points, y<x+4y<x+4. (0,0)(0,0) (−5,−15)(−5,−15) boundary line y=x+4y=x+4 y>x+4y>x+4 y<x+4y<x+4 What about the point (2,6)(2,6)? Because 6=2+46=2+4, the point is a solution to the equation y=x+4y=x+4. So the point (2,6)(2,6) is on the boundary line. (2,6)(2,6) 6=2+46=2+4 y=x+4y=x+4 (2,6)(2,6) Let’s take another point on the left side of the boundary line and test whether or not it is a solution to the inequality y>x+4y>x+4. The point (0,10)(0,10) clearly looks to be to the left of the boundary line, doesn’t it? Is it a solution to the inequality? y>x+4y>x+4 (0,10)(0,10) Any point you choose on the left side of the boundary line is a solution to the inequality y>x+4y>x+4. All points on the left are solutions. y>x+4y>x+4 Similarly, all points on the right side of the boundary line, the side with (0,0)(0,0) and (−5,−15)(−5,−15), are not solutions to y>x+4y>x+4. See Figure 4.33. (0,0)(0,0) (−5,−15)(−5,−15) y>x+4y>x+4 Figure 4.33 The graph of the inequality y>x+4y>x+4 is shown in Figure 4.34 below. The line y=x+4y=x+4 divides the plane into two regions. The shaded side shows the solutions to the inequality y>x+4y>x+4. y>x+4y>x+4 y=x+4y=x+4 y>x+4y>x+4 The points on the boundary line, those where y=x+4y=x+4, are not solutions to the inequality y>x+4y>x+4, so the line itself is not part of the solution. We show that by making the line dashed, not solid. y=x+4y=x+4 y>x+4y>x+4 Figure 4.34 The graph of the inequality y>x+4y>x+4. Example 4.70 The boundary line shown is y=2x−1y=2x−1. Write the inequality shown by the graph. y=2x−1y=2x−1 Solution The line y=2x−1y=2x−1 is the boundary line. On one side of the line are the points with y>2x−1y>2x−1 and on the other side of the line are the points with y<2x−1y<2x−1. y=2x−1y=2x−1 y>2x−1y>2x−1 y<2x−1y<2x−1 Let’s test the point (0,0)(0,0) and see which inequality describes its side of the boundary line. (0,0)(0,0) At (0,0)(0,0), which inequality is true: (0,0)(0,0) Since, y>2x−1y>2x−1 is true, the side of the line with (0,0)(0,0), is the solution. The shaded region shows the solution of the inequality y>2x−1y>2x−1. y>2x−1y>2x−1 (0,0)(0,0) y>2x−1y>2x−1 Since the boundary line is graphed with a solid line, the inequality includes the equal sign. The graph shows the inequality y≥2x−1y≥2x−1. y≥2x−1y≥2x−1 We could use any point as a test point, provided it is not on the line. Why did we choose (0,0)(0,0)? Because it’s the easiest to evaluate. You may want to pick a point on the other side of the boundary line and check that y<2x−1y<2x−1. (0,0)(0,0) y<2x−1y<2x−1 Try It 4.139 Write the inequality shown by the graph with the boundary line y=−2x+3y=−2x+3. y=−2x+3y=−2x+3 Try It 4.140 Write the inequality shown by the graph with the boundary line y=12x−4y=12x−4. y=12x−4y=12x−4 Example 4.71 The boundary line shown is 2x+3y=62x+3y=6. Write the inequality shown by the graph. 2x+3y=62x+3y=6 Solution The line 2x+3y=62x+3y=6 is the boundary line. On one side of the line are the points with 2x+3y>62x+3y>6 and on the other side of the line are the points with 2x+3y<62x+3y<6. 2x+3y=62x+3y=6 2x+3y>62x+3y>6 2x+3y<62x+3y<6 Let’s test the point (0,0)(0,0) and see which inequality describes its side of the boundary line. (0,0)(0,0) At (0,0)(0,0), which inequality is true: (0,0)(0,0) So the side with (0,0)(0,0) is the side where 2x+3y<62x+3y<6. (0,0)(0,0) 2x+3y<62x+3y<6 (You may want to pick a point on the other side of the boundary line and check that 2x+3y>62x+3y>6.) 2x+3y>62x+3y>6 Since the boundary line is graphed as a dashed line, the inequality does not include an equal sign.

Example 4.73 Graph the linear inequality x−2y<5x−2y<5. x−2y<5x−2y<5 Solution First we graph the boundary line x−2y=5x−2y=5. The inequality is << so we draw a dashed line. x−2y=5x−2y=5 << Then we test a point. We’ll use (0,0)(0,0) again because it is easy to evaluate and it is not on the boundary line. (0,0)(0,0) Is (0,0)(0,0) a solution of x−2y<5x−2y<5? (0,0)(0,0) x−2y<5x−2y<5 The point (0,0)(0,0) is a solution of x−2y<5x−2y<5, so we shade in that side of the boundary line.

Then we won’t be able to use (0,0)(0,0) as a test point. No problem—we’ll just choose some other point that is not on the boundary line. (0,0)(0,0) Example 4.74 Graph the linear inequality y≤−4xy≤−4x. y≤−4xy≤−4x Solution First we graph the boundary line y=−4xy=−4x. It is in slope–intercept form, with m=−4andb=0m=−4andb=0. The inequality is ≤≤ so we draw a solid line. y=−4xy=−4x m=−4andb=0m=−4andb=0 ≤≤ Now, we need a test point. We can see that the point (1,0)(1,0) is not on the boundary line. (1,0)(1,0) Is (1,0)(1,0) a solution of y≤−4xy≤−4x? (1,0)(1,0) y≤−4xy≤−4x The point (1,0)(1,0) is not a solution to y≤−4xy≤−4x, so we shade in the opposite side of the boundary line. See Figure 4.35.

Page 52,"In Solving Linear Equations and Inequalities we learned how to solve linear equations with one variable. Remember that the solution of an equation is a value of the variable that makes a true statement when substituted into the equation. Now we will work with systems of linear equations, two or more linear equations grouped together. systems of linear equations System of Linear Equations When two or more linear equations are grouped together, they form a system of linear equations. We will focus our work here on systems of two linear equations in two unknowns. Later, you may solve larger systems of equations. An example of a system of two linear equations is shown below. We use a brace to show the two equations are grouped together to form a system of equations. A linear equation in two variables, like 2x + y = 7, has an infinite number of solutions. Its graph is a line. Remember, every point on the line is a solution to the equation and every solution to the equation is a point on the line. To solve a system of two linear equations, we want to find the values of the variables that are solutions to both equations. In other words, we are looking for the ordered pairs (x, y) that make both equations true. These are called the solutions to a system of equations. solutions to a system of equations Solutions of a System of Equations Solutions of a system of equations are the values of the variables that make all the equations true. A solution of a system of two linear equations is represented by an ordered pair (x, y). To determine if an ordered pair is a solution to a system of two equations, we substitute the values of the variables into each equation. If the ordered pair makes both equations true, it is a solution to the system. Let’s consider the system below: Is the ordered pair (2,−1)(2,−1) a solution? (2,−1)(2,−1) The ordered pair (2, −1) made both equations true. Therefore (2, −1) is a solution to this system. Let’s try another ordered pair. Is the ordered pair (3, 2) a solution? The ordered pair (3, 2) made one equation true, but it made the other equation false. Since it is not a solution to both equations, it is not a solution to this system. Example 5.1 Determine whether the ordered pair is a solution to the system: {x−y=−12x−y=−5{x−y=−12x−y=−5 {x−y=−12x−y=−5{x−y=−12x−y=−5 ⓐ (−2,−1)(−2,−1) ⓑ (−4,−3)(−4,−3) ⓐ (−2,−1)(−2,−1) ⓑ (−4,−3)(−4,−3) Solution ⓐ ⓑ Try It 5.1 Determine whether the ordered pair is a solution to the system: {3x+y=0x+2y=−5.{3x+y=0x+2y=−5. {3x+y=0x+2y=−5.{3x+y=0x+2y=−5. ⓐ (1,−3)(1,−3) ⓑ (0,0)(0,0) ⓐ (1,−3)(1,−3) ⓑ (0,0)(0,0) Try It 5.2 Determine whether the ordered pair is a solution to the system: {x−3y=−8−3x−y=4.{x−3y=−8−3x−y=4. {x−3y=−8−3x−y=4.{x−3y=−8−3x−y=4. ⓐ (2,−2)(2,−2) ⓑ (−2,2)(−2,2) ⓐ (2,−2)(2,−2) ⓑ (−2,2)(−2,2)"

Page 52,"In this chapter we will use three methods to solve a system of linear equations. The first method we’ll use is graphing. The graph of a linear equation is a line. Each point on the line is a solution to the equation. For a system of two equations, we will graph two lines. Then we can see all the points that are solutions to each equation. And, by finding what the lines have in common, we’ll find the solution to the system. Most linear equations in one variable have one solution, but we saw that some equations, called contradictions, have no solutions and for other equations, called identities, all numbers are solutions. Similarly, when we solve a system of two linear equations represented by a graph of two lines in the same plane, there are three possible cases, as shown in Figure 5.2: Figure 5.2 For the first example of solving a system of linear equations in this section and in the next two sections, we will solve the same system of two linear equations. But we’ll use a different method in each section. After seeing the third method, you’ll decide which method was the most convenient way to solve this system. Example 5.2 Solve the system by graphing: {2x+y=7x−2y=6.{2x+y=7x−2y=6. {2x+y=7x−2y=6.{2x+y=7x−2y=6. Solution Try It 5.3 Solve the system by graphing: {x−3y=−3x+y=5.{x−3y=−3x+y=5. {x−3y=−3x+y=5.{x−3y=−3x+y=5. Try It 5.4 Solve the system by graphing: {−x+y=13x+2y=12.{−x+y=13x+2y=12. {−x+y=13x+2y=12.{−x+y=13x+2y=12. The steps to use to solve a system of linear equations by graphing are shown below. How To To solve a system of linear equations by graphing. Step 1. Graph the first equation. Step 2. Graph the second equation on the same rectangular coordinate system. Step 3. Determine whether the lines intersect, are parallel, or are the same line. Step 4. Example 5.3 Solve the system by graphing: {y=2x+1y=4x−1.{y=2x+1y=4x−1. {y=2x+1y=4x−1.{y=2x+1y=4x−1. Solution Both of the equations in this system are in slope-intercept form, so we will use their slopes and y-intercepts to graph them. {y=2x+1y=4x−1{y=2x+1y=4x−1 {y=2x+1y=4x−1{y=2x+1y=4x−1 Try It 5.5 Solve each system by graphing: {y=2x+2y=−x−4.{y=2x+2y=−x−4. {y=2x+2y=−x−4.{y=2x+2y=−x−4. Try It 5.6 Solve each system by graphing: {y=3x+3y=−x+7.{y=3x+3y=−x+7. {y=3x+3y=−x+7.{y=3x+3y=−x+7. Both equations in Example 5.3 were given in slope–intercept form. This made it easy for us to quickly graph the lines. In the next example, we’ll first re-write the equations into slope–intercept form. Example 5.4 Solve the system by graphing: {3x+y=−12x+y=0.{3x+y=−12x+y=0. {3x+y=−12x+y=0.{3x+y=−12x+y=0. Solution We’ll solve both of these equations for yy so that we can easily graph them using their slopes and y-intercepts. {3x+y=−12x+y=0{3x+y=−12x+y=0 yy {3x+y=−12x+y=0{3x+y=−12x+y=0 Try It 5.7 Solve each system by graphing: {−x+y=12x+y=10.{−x+y=12x+y=10. {−x+y=12x+y=10.{−x+y=12x+y=10.

Usually when equations are given in standard form, the most convenient way to graph them is by using the intercepts. We’ll do this in Example 5.5. Example 5.5 Solve the system by graphing: {x+y=2x−y=4.{x+y=2x−y=4. {x+y=2x−y=4.{x+y=2x−y=4. Solution We will find the x- and y-intercepts of both equations and use them to graph the lines. Try It 5.9 Solve each system by graphing: {x+y=6x−y=2.{x+y=6x−y=2. {x+y=6x−y=2.{x+y=6x−y=2. Try It 5.10 Solve each system by graphing: {x+y=2x−y=−8.{x+y=2x−y=−8. {x+y=2x−y=−8.{x+y=2x−y=−8. Do you remember how to graph a linear equation with just one variable? It will be either a vertical or a horizontal line. Example 5.6 Solve the system by graphing: {y=62x+3y=12.{y=62x+3y=12. {y=62x+3y=12.{y=62x+3y=12. Solution Try It 5.11 Solve each system by graphing: {y=−1x+3y=6.{y=−1x+3y=6. {y=−1x+3y=6.{y=−1x+3y=6. Try It 5.12 Solve each system by graphing: {x=43x−2y=24.{x=43x−2y=24. {x=43x−2y=24.{x=43x−2y=24. In all the systems of linear equations so far, the lines intersected and the solution was one point. In the next two examples, we’ll look at a system of equations that has no solution and at a system of equations that has an infinite number of solutions. Example 5.7 Solve the system by graphing: {y=12x−3x−2y=4.{y=12x−3x−2y=4. {y=12x−3x−2y=4.{y=12x−3x−2y=4.

Try It 5.14 Solve each system by graphing: {y=3x−16x−2y=6.{y=3x−16x−2y=6. {y=3x−16x−2y=6.{y=3x−16x−2y=6. Example 5.8 Solve the system by graphing: {y=2x−3−6x+3y=−9.{y=2x−3−6x+3y=−9. {y=2x−3−6x+3y=−9.{y=2x−3−6x+3y=−9.

Try It 5.16 Solve each system by graphing: {y=12x−42x−4y=16.{y=12x−42x−4y=16. {y=12x−42x−4y=16.{y=12x−42x−4y=16. If you write the second equation in Example 5.8 in slope-intercept form, you may recognize that the equations have the same slope and same y-intercept. When we graphed the second line in the last example, we drew it right over the first line. We say the two lines are coincident. Coincident lines have the same slope and same y-intercept. Coincident Lines Coincident lines have the same slope and same y-intercept."
Page 52,"There will be times when we will want to know how many solutions there will be to a system of linear equations, but we might not actually have to find the solution. It will be helpful to determine this without graphing. We have seen that two lines in the same plane must either intersect or are parallel. The systems of equations in Example 5.2 through Example 5.6 all had two intersecting lines. Each system had one solution. A system with parallel lines, like Example 5.7, has no solution. What happened in Example 5.8? The equations have coincident lines, and so the system had infinitely many solutions. coincident lines We’ll organize these results in Figure 5.3 below: Figure 5.3 Parallel lines have the same slope but different y-intercepts. So, if we write both equations in a system of linear equations in slope–intercept form, we can see how many solutions there will be without graphing! Look at the system we solved in Example 5.7. The two lines have the same slope but different y-intercepts. They are parallel lines. Figure 5.4 shows how to determine the number of solutions of a linear system by looking at the slopes and intercepts. Figure 5.4 Let’s take one more look at our equations in Example 5.7 that gave us parallel lines. When both lines were in slope-intercept form we had: Do you recognize that it is impossible to have a single ordered pair (x,y)(x,y) that is a solution to both of those equations? (x,y)(x,y) We call a system of equations like this an inconsistent system. It has no solution. an inconsistent system A system of equations that has at least one solution is called a consistent system. consistent system Consistent and Inconsistent Systems A consistent system of equations is a system of equations with at least one solution. consistent system An inconsistent system of equations is a system of equations with no solution. inconsistent system We also categorize the equations in a system of equations by calling the equations independent or dependent. If two equations are independent equations, they each have their own set of solutions. Intersecting lines and parallel lines are independent. independent equations If two equations are dependent, all the solutions of one equation are also solutions of the other equation. When we graph two dependent equations, we get coincident lines. dependent equations Independent and Dependent Equations Two equations are independent if they have different solutions. independent Two equations are dependent if all the solutions of one equation are also solutions of the other equation. dependent Let’s sum this up by looking at the graphs of the three types of systems. See Figure 5.5 and Figure 5.6. Figure 5.5 Figure 5.6 Example 5.9 Without graphing, determine the number of solutions and then classify the system of equations: {y=3x−16x−2y=12.{y=3x−16x−2y=12. {y=3x−16x−2y=12.{y=3x−16x−2y=12.

Page 52,"We will use the same problem solving strategy we used in Math Models to set up and solve applications of systems of linear equations. We’ll modify the strategy slightly here to make it appropriate for systems of equations. How To Use a problem solving strategy for systems of linear equations. Step 1. Read the problem. Make sure all the words and ideas are understood. Step 2. Identify what we are looking for. Step 3. Name what we are looking for. Choose variables to represent those quantities. Step 4. Translate into a system of equations. Step 5. Solve the system of equations using good algebra techniques. Step 6. Check the answer in the problem and make sure it makes sense. Step 7. Answer the question with a complete sentence. Step 5 is where we will use the method introduced in this section. We will graph the equations and find the solution. Example 5.12 Sondra is making 10 quarts of punch from fruit juice and club soda. The number of quarts of fruit juice is 4 times the number of quarts of club soda. How many quarts of fruit juice and how many quarts of club soda does Sondra need? Solution Step 1. Read the problem. Step 2. Identify what we are looking for. We are looking for the number of quarts of fruit juice and the number of quarts of club soda that Sondra will need. Step 3. Name what we are looking for. Choose variables to represent those quantities. Let f=f= number of quarts of fruit juice.
    c=c= number of quarts of club soda f=f= c=c= Step 4. Translate into a system of equations. We now have the system. {f+c=10f=4c{f+c=10f=4c {f+c=10f=4c{f+c=10f=4c Step 5. Solve the system of equations using good algebra techniques. The point of intersection (2, 8) is the solution. This means Sondra needs 2 quarts of club soda and 8 quarts of fruit juice. Step 6. Check the answer in the problem and make sure it makes sense. Does this make sense in the problem? Yes, the number of quarts of fruit juice, 8 is 4 times the number of quarts of club soda, 2. Yes, 10 quarts of punch is 8 quarts of fruit juice plus 2 quarts of club soda. Step 7. Answer the question with a complete sentence. Sondra needs 8 quarts of fruit juice and 2 quarts of soda. Try It 5.23 Manny is making 12 quarts of orange juice from concentrate and water. The number of quarts of water is 3 times the number of quarts of concentrate. How many quarts of concentrate and how many quarts of water does Manny need? Try It 5.24 Alisha is making an 18 ounce coffee beverage that is made from brewed coffee and milk. The number of ounces of brewed coffee is 5 times greater than the number of ounces of milk. How many ounces of coffee and how many ounces of milk does Alisha need?

5 Solve Applications of Systems of Equations by Graphing In the following exercises, solve. . Molly is making strawberry infused water. For each ounce of strawberry juice, she uses three times as many ounces of water. How many ounces of strawberry juice and how many ounces of water does she need to make 64 ounces of strawberry infused water? 64 . Jamal is making a snack mix that contains only pretzels and nuts. For every ounce of nuts, he will use 2 ounces of pretzels. How many ounces of pretzels and how many ounces of nuts does he need to make 45 ounces of snack mix? . Enrique is making a party mix that contains raisins and nuts. For each ounce of nuts, he uses twice the amount of raisins. How many ounces of nuts and how many ounces of raisins does he need to make 24 ounces of party mix? 66 . Owen is making lemonade from concentrate. The number of quarts of water he needs is 4 times the number of quarts of concentrate. How many quarts of water and how many quarts of concentrate does Owen need to make 100 quarts of lemonade? . Leo is planning his spring flower garden. He wants to plant tulip and daffodil bulbs. He will plant 6 times as many daffodil bulbs as tulip bulbs. If he wants to plant 350 bulbs, how many tulip bulbs and how many daffodil bulbs should he plant? 68 . A marketing company surveys 1,200 people. They surveyed twice as many females as males. How many males and females did they survey? . In a system of linear equations, the two equations have the same slope. Describe the possible solutions to the system. 70 . In a system of linear equations, the two equations have the same intercepts. Describe the possible solutions to the system. After completing the exercises, use this checklist to evaluate your mastery of the objectives of this section. If most of your checks were: …confidently. Congratulations! You have achieved the objectives in this section. Reflect on the study skills you used so that you can continue to use them. What did you do to become confident of your ability to do these things? Be specific. …with some help. This must be addressed quickly because topics you do not master become potholes in your road to success. In math every topic builds upon previous work. It is important to make sure you have a strong foundation before you move on. Whom can you ask for help? Your fellow classmates and instructor are good resources. Is there a place on campus where math tutors are available? Can your study skills be improved? …no - I don’t get it! This is a warning sign and you must not ignore it. You should get help right away or you will quickly be overwhelmed. See your instructor as soon as you can to discuss your situation. Together you can come up with a plan to get you the help you need."

Page 52,"After completing the exercises, use this checklist to evaluate your mastery of the objectives of this section. If most of your checks were: …confidently. Congratulations! You have achieved the objectives in this section. Reflect on the study skills you used so that you can continue to use them. What did you do to become confident of your ability to do these things? Be specific. …with some help. This must be addressed quickly because topics you do not master become potholes in your road to success. In math every topic builds upon previous work. It is important to make sure you have a strong foundation before you move on. Whom can you ask for help? Your fellow classmates and instructor are good resources. Is there a place on campus where math tutors are available? Can your study skills be improved? …no - I don’t get it! This is a warning sign and you must not ignore it. You should get help right away or you will quickly be overwhelmed. See your instructor as soon as you can to discuss your situation. Together you can come up with a plan to get you the help you need."
Page 53,"By the end of this section, you will be able to:"
Page 53,"We will use the same system we used first for graphing. We will first solve one of the equations for either x or y. We can choose either equation and solve for either variable—but we’ll try to make a choice that will keep the work easy. Then we substitute that expression into the other equation. The result is an equation with just one variable—and we know how to solve those! After we find the value of one variable, we will substitute that value into one of the original equations and solve for the other variable. Finally, we check our solution and make sure it makes both equations true. We’ll fill in all these steps now in Example 5.13. Example 5.13 Solve the system by substitution. {2x+y=7x−2y=6{2x+y=7x−2y=6 {2x+y=7x−2y=6{2x+y=7x−2y=6 Solution Try It 5.25 Solve the system by substitution. {−2x+y=−11x+3y=9{−2x+y=−11x+3y=9 {−2x+y=−11x+3y=9{−2x+y=−11x+3y=9 Try It 5.26 Solve the system by substitution. {x+3y=104x+y=18{x+3y=104x+y=18 {x+3y=104x+y=18{x+3y=104x+y=18 How To Solve a system of equations by substitution. Step 1. Solve one of the equations for either variable. Step 2. Substitute the expression from Step 1 into the other equation. Step 3. Solve the resulting equation. Step 4. Substitute the solution in Step 3 into one of the original equations to find the other variable. Step 5. Write the solution as an ordered pair. Step 6. Check that the ordered pair is a solution to both original equations. If one of the equations in the system is given in slope–intercept form, Step 1 is already done! We’ll see this in Example 5.14. Example 5.14 Solve the system by substitution. {x+y=−1y=x+5{x+y=−1y=x+5 {x+y=−1y=x+5{x+y=−1y=x+5 Solution The second equation is already solved for y. We will substitute the expression in place of y in the first equation.

In this next example, we’ll solve the first equation for y. Example 5.15 Solve the system by substitution. {3x+y=52x+4y=−10{3x+y=52x+4y=−10 {3x+y=52x+4y=−10{3x+y=52x+4y=−10 Solution We need to solve one equation for one variable. Then we will substitute that expression into the other equation.

In Example 5.16 it will be easier to solve for x. Example 5.16 Solve the system by substitution. {x−2y=−23x+2y=34{x−2y=−23x+2y=34 {x−2y=−23x+2y=34{x−2y=−23x+2y=34 Solution We will solve the first equation for xx and then substitute the expression into the second equation. xx Try It 5.31 Solve the system by substitution. {x−5y=134x−3y=1{x−5y=134x−3y=1 {x−5y=134x−3y=1{x−5y=134x−3y=1 Try It 5.32 Solve the system by substitution. {x−6y=−62x−4y=4{x−6y=−62x−4y=4 {x−6y=−62x−4y=4{x−6y=−62x−4y=4 When both equations are already solved for the same variable, it is easy to substitute! Example 5.17 Solve the system by substitution. {y=−2x+5y=12x{y=−2x+5y=12x {y=−2x+5y=12x{y=−2x+5y=12x Solution Since both equations are solved for y, we can substitute one into the other. Try It 5.33 Solve the system by substitution. {y=3x−16y=13x{y=3x−16y=13x {y=3x−16y=13x{y=3x−16y=13x Try It 5.34 Solve the system by substitution. {y=−x+10y=14x{y=−x+10y=14x {y=−x+10y=14x{y=−x+10y=14x Be very careful with the signs in the next example. Example 5.18 Solve the system by substitution. {4x+2y=46x−y=8{4x+2y=46x−y=8 {4x+2y=46x−y=8{4x+2y=46x−y=8 Solution We need to solve one equation for one variable. We will solve the first equation for y. Try It 5.35 Solve the system by substitution. {x−4y=−4−3x+4y=0{x−4y=−4−3x+4y=0 {x−4y=−4−3x+4y=0{x−4y=−4−3x+4y=0 Try It 5.36 Solve the system by substitution. {4x−y=02x−3y=5{4x−y=02x−3y=5 {4x−y=02x−3y=5{4x−y=02x−3y=5 In Example 5.19, it will take a little more work to solve one equation for x or y. Example 5.19 Solve the system by substitution. {4x−3y=615y−20x=−30{4x−3y=615y−20x=−30 {4x−3y=615y−20x=−30{4x−3y=615y−20x=−30 Solution We need to solve one equation for one variable. We will solve the first equation for x. Since 0 = 0 is a true statement, the system is consistent. The equations are dependent. The graphs of these two equations would give the same line. The system has infinitely many solutions. Try It 5.37 Solve the system by substitution. {2x−3y=12−12y+8x=48{2x−3y=12−12y+8x=48 {2x−3y=12−12y+8x=48{2x−3y=12−12y+8x=48 Try It 5.38 Solve the system by substitution. {5x+2y=12−4y−10x=−24{5x+2y=12−4y−10x=−24 {5x+2y=12−4y−10x=−24{5x+2y=12−4y−10x=−24 Look back at the equations in Example 5.19. Is there any way to recognize that they are the same line? Let’s see what happens in the next example. Example 5.20 Solve the system by substitution. {5x−2y=−10y=52x{5x−2y=−10y=52x {5x−2y=−10y=52x{5x−2y=−10y=52x Solution The second equation is already solved for y, so we can substitute for y in the first equation. Since 0 = −10 is a false statement the equations are inconsistent. The graphs of the two equation would be parallel lines. The system has no solutions. Try It 5.39 Solve the system by substitution. {3x+2y=9y=−32x+1{3x+2y=9y=−32x+1 {3x+2y=9y=−32x+1{3x+2y=9y=−32x+1 Try It 5.40 Solve the system by substitution. {5x−3y=2y=53x−4{5x−3y=2y=53x−4 {5x−3y=2y=53x−4{5x−3y=2y=53x−4"

Page 53,"We’ll copy here the problem solving strategy we used in the Solving Systems of Equations by Graphing section for solving systems of equations. Now that we know how to solve systems by substitution, that’s what we’ll do in Step 5. How To How to use a problem solving strategy for systems of linear equations. Step 1. Read the problem. Make sure all the words and ideas are understood. Step 2. Identify what we are looking for. Step 3. Name what we are looking for. Choose variables to represent those quantities. Step 4. Translate into a system of equations. Step 5. Solve the system of equations using good algebra techniques. Step 6. Check the answer in the problem and make sure it makes sense. Step 7. Answer the question with a complete sentence. Some people find setting up word problems with two variables easier than setting them up with just one variable. Choosing the variable names is easier when all you need to do is write down two letters. Think about this in the next example—how would you have done it with just one variable? Example 5.21 The sum of two numbers is zero. One number is nine less than the other. Find the numbers. Solution Try It 5.41 The sum of two numbers is 10. One number is 4 less than the other. Find the numbers. Try It 5.42 The sum of two number is −6. One number is 10 less than the other. Find the numbers. In the Example 5.22, we’ll use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, P = 2L + 2W. Example 5.22 The perimeter of a rectangle is 88. The length is five more than twice the width. Find the length and the width. Solution Try It 5.43 The perimeter of a rectangle is 40. The length is 4 more than the width. Find the length and width of the rectangle. Try It 5.44 The perimeter of a rectangle is 58. The length is 5 more than three times the width. Find the length and width of the rectangle. For Example 5.23 we need to remember that the sum of the measures of the angles of a triangle is 180 degrees and that a right triangle has one 90 degree angle. Example 5.23 The measure of one of the small angles of a right triangle is ten more than three times the measure of the other small angle. Find the measures of both angles. Solution We will draw and label a figure. Try It 5.45 The measure of one of the small angles of a right triangle is 2 more than 3 times the measure of the other small angle. Find the measure of both angles. Try It 5.46 The measure of one of the small angles of a right triangle is 18 less than twice the measure of the other small angle. Find the measure of both angles. Example 5.24 Heather has been offered two options for her salary as a trainer at the gym. Option A would pay her $25,000 plus $15 for each training session. Option B would pay her $10,000 + $40 for each training session. How many training sessions would make the salary options equal? Solution Try It 5.47 Geraldine has been offered positions by two insurance companies. The first company pays a salary of $12,000 plus a commission of $100 for each policy sold. The second pays a salary of $20,000 plus a commission of $50 for each policy sold. How many policies would need to be sold to make the total pay the same? Try It 5.48 Kenneth currently sells suits for company A at a salary of $22,000 plus a $10 commission for each suit sold. Company B offers him a position with a salary of $28,000 plus a $4 commission for each suit sold. How many suits would Kenneth need to sell for the options to be equal?

Page 54,"The Elimination Method is based on the Addition Property of Equality. The Addition Property of Equality says that when you add the same quantity to both sides of an equation, you still have equality. We will extend the Addition Property of Equality to say that when you add equal quantities to both sides of an equation, the results are equal. Elimination Method For any expressions a, b, c, and d, To solve a system of equations by elimination, we start with both equations in standard form. Then we decide which variable will be easiest to eliminate. How do we decide? We want to have the coefficients of one variable be opposites, so that we can add the equations together and eliminate that variable. Notice how that works when we add these two equations together: The y’s add to zero and we have one equation with one variable. Let’s try another one: This time we don’t see a variable that can be immediately eliminated if we add the equations. But if we multiply the first equation by −2, we will make the coefficients of x opposites. We must multiply every term on both sides of the equation by −2. Now we see that the coefficients of the x terms are opposites, so x will be eliminated when we add these two equations. Add the equations yourself—the result should be −3y = −6. And that looks easy to solve, doesn’t it? Here is what it would look like. We’ll do one more: It doesn’t appear that we can get the coefficients of one variable to be opposites by multiplying one of the equations by a constant, unless we use fractions. So instead, we’ll have to multiply both equations by a constant. We can make the coefficients of x be opposites if we multiply the first equation by 3 and the second by −4, so we get 12x and −12x. This gives us these two new equations: When we add these equations, the x’s are eliminated and we just have −29y = 58. Once we get an equation with just one variable, we solve it. Then we substitute that value into one of the original equations to solve for the remaining variable. And, as always, we check our answer to make sure it is a solution to both of the original equations. Now we’ll see how to use elimination to solve the same system of equations we solved by graphing and by substitution. Example 5.25 Solve the system by elimination. {2x+y=7x−2y=6{2x+y=7x−2y=6 {2x+y=7x−2y=6{2x+y=7x−2y=6 Solution Try It 5.49 Solve the system by elimination. {3x+y=52x−3y=7{3x+y=52x−3y=7 {3x+y=52x−3y=7{3x+y=52x−3y=7 Try It 5.50 Solve the system by elimination. {4x+y=−5−2x−2y=−2{4x+y=−5−2x−2y=−2 {4x+y=−5−2x−2y=−2{4x+y=−5−2x−2y=−2 The steps are listed below for easy reference. How To How to solve a system of equations by elimination. Step 1. Write both equations in standard form. If any coefficients are fractions, clear them. Step 2. Step 3. Add the equations resulting from Step 2 to eliminate one variable. Step 4. Solve for the remaining variable. Step 5. Substitute the solution from Step 4 into one of the original equations. Then solve for the other variable. Step 6. Write the solution as an ordered pair. Step 7. Check that the ordered pair is a solution to both original equations. First we’ll do an example where we can eliminate one variable right away. Example 5.26 Solve the system by elimination. {x+y=10x−y=12{x+y=10x−y=12 {x+y=10x−y=12{x+y=10x−y=12 Solution Try It 5.51 Solve the system by elimination. {2x+y=5x−y=4{2x+y=5x−y=4 {2x+y=5x−y=4{2x+y=5x−y=4 Try It 5.52 Solve the system by elimination. {x+y=3−2x−y=−1{x+y=3−2x−y=−1 {x+y=3−2x−y=−1{x+y=3−2x−y=−1 In Example 5.27, we will be able to make the coefficients of one variable opposites by multiplying one equation by a constant. Example 5.27 Solve the system by elimination. {3x−2y=−25x−6y=10{3x−2y=−25x−6y=10 {3x−2y=−25x−6y=10{3x−2y=−25x−6y=10 Solution Try It 5.53 Solve the system by elimination. {4x−3y=15x−9y=−4{4x−3y=15x−9y=−4 {4x−3y=15x−9y=−4{4x−3y=15x−9y=−4 Try It 5.54 Solve the system by elimination. {3x+2y=26x+5y=8{3x+2y=26x+5y=8 {3x+2y=26x+5y=8{3x+2y=26x+5y=8 Now we’ll do an example where we need to multiply both equations by constants in order to make the coefficients of one variable opposites. Example 5.28 Solve the system by elimination. {4x−3y=97x+2y=−6{4x−3y=97x+2y=−6 {4x−3y=97x+2y=−6{4x−3y=97x+2y=−6 Solution In this example, we cannot multiply just one equation by any constant to get opposite coefficients. So we will strategically multiply both equations by a constant to get the opposites. What other constants could we have chosen to eliminate one of the variables? Would the solution be the same? Try It 5.55 Solve the system by elimination. {3x−4y=−95x+3y=14{3x−4y=−95x+3y=14 {3x−4y=−95x+3y=14{3x−4y=−95x+3y=14 Try It 5.56 Solve the system by elimination. {7x+8y=43x−5y=27{7x+8y=43x−5y=27 {7x+8y=43x−5y=27{7x+8y=43x−5y=27 When the system of equations contains fractions, we will first clear the fractions by multiplying each equation by its LCD. Example 5.29 Solve the system by elimination. {x+12y=632x+23y=172{x+12y=632x+23y=172 {x+12y=632x+23y=172{x+12y=632x+23y=172 Solution In this example, both equations have fractions. Our first step will be to multiply each equation by its LCD to clear the fractions. Try It 5.57 Solve the system by elimination. {13x−12y=134x−y=52{13x−12y=134x−y=52 {13x−12y=134x−y=52{13x−12y=134x−y=52 Try It 5.58 Solve the system by elimination. {x+35y=−15−12x−23y=56{x+35y=−15−12x−23y=56 {x+35y=−15−12x−23y=56{x+35y=−15−12x−23y=56 In the Solving Systems of Equations by Graphing we saw that not all systems of linear equations have a single ordered pair as a solution. When the two equations were really the same line, there were infinitely many solutions. We called that a consistent system. When the two equations described parallel lines, there was no solution. We called that an inconsistent system. Example 5.30 Solve the system by elimination. {3x+4y=12y=3−34x{3x+4y=12y=3−34x {3x+4y=12y=3−34x{3x+4y=12y=3−34x Solution This is a true statement. The equations are consistent but dependent. Their graphs would be the same line. The system has infinitely many solutions. After we cleared the fractions in the second equation, did you notice that the two equations were the same? That means we have coincident lines. Try It 5.59 Solve the system by elimination. {5x−3y=15y=−5+53x{5x−3y=15y=−5+53x {5x−3y=15y=−5+53x{5x−3y=15y=−5+53x Try It 5.60 Solve the system by elimination. {x+2y=6y=−12x+3{x+2y=6y=−12x+3 {x+2y=6y=−12x+3{x+2y=6y=−12x+3 Example 5.31 Solve the system by elimination. {−6x+15y=102x−5y=−5{−6x+15y=102x−5y=−5 {−6x+15y=102x−5y=−5{−6x+15y=102x−5y=−5 Solution This statement is false. The equations are inconsistent and so their graphs would be parallel lines. The system does not have a solution. Try It 5.61 Solve the system by elimination. {−3x+2y=89x−6y=13{−3x+2y=89x−6y=13 {−3x+2y=89x−6y=13{−3x+2y=89x−6y=13 Try It 5.62 Solve the system by elimination. {7x−3y=−2−14x+6y=8{7x−3y=−2−14x+6y=8 {7x−3y=−2−14x+6y=8{7x−3y=−2−14x+6y=8"

Page 54,"Some applications problems translate directly into equations in standard form, so we will use the elimination method to solve them. As before, we use our Problem Solving Strategy to help us stay focused and organized. Example 5.32 The sum of two numbers is 39. Their difference is 9. Find the numbers. Solution Try It 5.63 The sum of two numbers is 42. Their difference is 8. Find the numbers. Try It 5.64 The sum of two numbers is −15. Their difference is −35. Find the numbers. Example 5.33 Joe stops at a burger restaurant every day on his way to work. Monday he had one order of medium fries and two small sodas, which had a total of 620 calories. Tuesday he had two orders of medium fries and one small soda, for a total of 820 calories. How many calories are there in one order of medium fries? How many calories in one small soda? Solution Try It 5.65 Malik stops at the grocery store to buy a bag of diapers and 2 cans of formula. He spends a total of $37. The next week he stops and buys 2 bags of diapers and 5 cans of formula for a total of $87. How much does a bag of diapers cost? How much is one can of formula? Try It 5.66 To get her daily intake of fruit for the day, Sasha eats a banana and 8 strawberries on Wednesday for a calorie count of 145. On the following Wednesday, she eats two bananas and 5 strawberries for a total of 235 calories for the fruit. How many calories are there in a banana? How many calories are in a strawberry?"
Page 54,"When you will have to solve a system of linear equations in a later math class, you will usually not be told which method to use. You will need to make that decision yourself. So you’ll want to choose the method that is easiest to do and minimizes your chance of making mistakes. Example 5.34 For each system of linear equations decide whether it would be more convenient to solve it by substitution or elimination. Explain your answer. ⓐ {3x+8y=407x−4y=−32{3x+8y=407x−4y=−32 ⓑ {5x+6y=12y=23x−1{5x+6y=12y=23x−1 ⓐ {3x+8y=407x−4y=−32{3x+8y=407x−4y=−32 ⓑ {5x+6y=12y=23x−1{5x+6y=12y=23x−1 Solution ⓐ ⓑ >Since one equation is already solved for y, using substitution will be most convenient.

Page 55,"Many of the problems we solved in earlier applications related two quantities. Here are two of the examples from the chapter on Math Models. In that chapter we translated each situation into one equation using only one variable. Sometimes it was a bit of a challenge figuring out how to name the two quantities, wasn’t it? Let’s see how we can translate these two problems into a system of equations with two variables. We’ll focus on Steps 1 through 4 of our Problem Solving Strategy. Example 5.35 Translate to a system of equations: The sum of two numbers is negative fourteen. One number is four less than the other. Find the numbers. Solution Try It 5.69 Translate to a system of equations: The sum of two numbers is negative twenty-three. One number is 7 less than the other. Find the numbers. Try It 5.70 Translate to a system of equations: The sum of two numbers is negative eighteen. One number is 40 more than the other. Find the numbers. We’ll do another example where we stop after we write the system of equations. Example 5.36 Translate to a system of equations: A married couple together earns $110,000 a year. The wife earns $16,000 less than twice what her husband earns. What does the husband earn? Solution Try It 5.71 Translate to a system of equations: A couple has a total household income of $84,000. The husband earns $18,000 less than twice what the wife earns. How much does the wife earn? Try It 5.72 Translate to a system of equations: A senior employee makes $5 less than twice what a new employee makes per hour. Together they make $43 per hour. How much does each employee make per hour?"

How many calories did she burn for each minutes on the rowing machine? How many calories did she burn for each minute of weight lifting?"
Page 55,"When we learned about Math Models, we solved geometry applications using properties of triangles and rectangles. Now we’ll add to our list some properties of angles. The measures of two complementary angles add to 90 degrees. The measures of two supplementary angles add to 180 degrees. complementary angles supplementary angles Complementary and Supplementary Angles Two angles are complementary if the sum of the measures of their angles is 90 degrees. Two angles are supplementary if the sum of the measures of their angles is 180 degrees. If two angles are complementary, we say that one angle is the complement of the other. If two angles are supplementary, we say that one angle is the supplement of the other. Example 5.39 Translate to a system of equations and then solve: The difference of two complementary angles is 26 degrees. Find the measures of the angles. Solution Try It 5.77 Translate to a system of equations and then solve: The difference of two complementary angles is 20 degrees. Find the measures of the angles. Try It 5.78 Translate to a system of equations and then solve: The difference of two complementary angles is 80 degrees. Find the measures of the angles.

He will only need to fence around three sides, because the fourth side will be the wall of the house. He wants the length of the fenced yard (parallel to the house wall) to be 5 feet more than four times as long as the width. Find the length and the width. Solution Try It 5.81 Translate to a system of equations and then solve: Mario wants to put a rectangular fence around the pool in his backyard. Since one side is adjacent to the house, he will only need to fence three sides. There are two long sides and the one shorter side is parallel to the house. He needs 155 feet of fencing to enclose the pool. The length of the long side is 10 feet less than twice the width. Find the length and width of the pool area to be enclosed. Try It 5.82 Translate to a system of equations and then solve: Alexis wants to build a rectangular dog run in her yard adjacent to her neighbor’s fence. She will use 136 feet of fencing to completely enclose the rectangular dog run. The length of the dog run along the neighbor’s fence will be 16 feet less than twice the width. Find the length and width of the dog run."
Page 55,"We used a table to organize the information in uniform motion problems when we introduced them earlier. We’ll continue using the table here. The basic equation was D = rt where D is the distance travelled, r is the rate, and t is the time. Our first example of a uniform motion application will be for a situation similar to some we have already seen, but now we can use two variables and two equations. Example 5.42 Translate to a system of equations and then solve: Joni left St. Louis on the interstate, driving west towards Denver at a speed of 65 miles per hour. Half an hour later, Kelly left St. Louis on the same route as Joni, driving 78 miles per hour. How long will it take Kelly to catch up to Joni? Solution A diagram is useful in helping us visualize the situation. Try It 5.83 Translate to a system of equations and then solve: Mitchell left Detroit on the interstate driving south towards Orlando at a speed of 60 miles per hour. Clark left Detroit 1 hour later traveling at a speed of 75 miles per hour, following the same route as Mitchell. How long will it take Clark to catch Mitchell? Try It 5.84 Translate to a system of equations and then solve: Charlie left his mother’s house traveling at an average speed of 36 miles per hour. His sister Sally left 15 minutes (1/4 hour) later traveling the same route at an average speed of 42 miles per hour. How long before Sally catches up to Charlie? Many real-world applications of uniform motion arise because of the effects of currents—of water or air—on the actual speed of a vehicle. Cross-country airplane flights in the United States generally take longer going west than going east because of the prevailing wind currents. Let’s take a look at a boat travelling on a river. Depending on which way the boat is going, the current of the water is either slowing it down or speeding it up. Figure 5.7 and Figure 5.8 show how a river current affects the speed at which a boat is actually travelling. We’ll call the speed of the boat in still water b and the speed of the river current c. In Figure 5.7 the boat is going downstream, in the same direction as the river current. The current helps push the boat, so the boat’s actual speed is faster than its speed in still water. The actual speed at which the boat is moving is b + c. Figure 5.7 In Figure 5.8 the boat is going upstream, opposite to the river current. The current is going against the boat, so the boat’s actual speed is slower than its speed in still water. The actual speed of the boat is b−cb−c. b−cb−c Figure 5.8 We’ll put some numbers to this situation in Example 5.43. Example 5.43 Translate to a system of equations and then solve: A river cruise ship sailed 60 miles downstream for 4 hours and then took 5 hours sailing upstream to return to the dock. Find the speed of the ship in still water and the speed of the river current. Solution Read the problem. This is a uniform motion problem and a picture will help us visualize the situation. Try It 5.85 Translate to a system of equations and then solve: A Mississippi river boat cruise sailed 120 miles upstream for 12 hours and then took 10 hours to return to the dock. Find the speed of the river boat in still water and the speed of the river current. Try It 5.86 Translate to a system of equations and then solve: Jason paddled his canoe 24 miles upstream for 4 hours. It took him 3 hours to paddle back. Find the speed of the canoe in still water and the speed of the river current. Wind currents affect airplane speeds in the same way as water currents affect boat speeds. We’ll see this in Example 5.44. A wind current in the same direction as the plane is flying is called a tailwind. A wind current blowing against the direction of the plane is called a headwind. Example 5.44 Translate to a system of equations and then solve: A private jet can fly 1095 miles in three hours with a tailwind but only 987 miles in three hours into a headwind. Find the speed of the jet in still air and the speed of the wind. Solution Read the problem. This is a uniform motion problem and a picture will help us visualize. Try It 5.87 Translate to a system of equations and then solve: A small jet can fly 1,325 miles in 5 hours with a tailwind but only 1035 miles in 5 hours into a headwind. Find the speed of the jet in still air and the speed of the wind. Try It 5.88 Translate to a system of equations and then solve: A commercial jet can fly 1728 miles in 4 hours with a tailwind but only 1536 miles in 4 hours into a headwind. Find the speed of the jet in still air and the speed of the wind."

Page 56,"When we solved mixture applications with coins and tickets earlier, we started by creating a table so we could organize the information. For a coin example with nickels and dimes, the table looked like this: Using one variable meant that we had to relate the number of nickels and the number of dimes. We had to decide if we were going to let n be the number of nickels and then write the number of dimes in terms of n, or if we would let d be the number of dimes and write the number of nickels in terms of d. Now that we know how to solve systems of equations with two variables, we’ll just let n be the number of nickels and d be the number of dimes. We’ll write one equation based on the total value column, like we did before, and the other equation will come from the number column. For the first example, we’ll do a ticket problem where the ticket prices are in whole dollars, so we won’t need to use decimals just yet. Example 5.45 Translate to a system of equations and solve: The box office at a movie theater sold 147 tickets for the evening show, and receipts totaled $1,302. How many $11 adult and how many $8 child tickets were sold? Solution Try It 5.89 Translate to a system of equations and solve: The ticket office at the zoo sold 553 tickets one day. The receipts totaled $3,936. How many $9 adult tickets and how many $6 child tickets were sold? Try It 5.90 Translate to a system of equations and solve: A science center sold 1,363 tickets on a busy weekend. The receipts totaled $12,146. How many $12 adult tickets and how many $7 child tickets were sold? In Example 5.46 we’ll solve a coin problem. Now that we know how to work with systems of two variables, naming the variables in the ‘number’ column will be easy. Example 5.46 Translate to a system of equations and solve: Priam has a collection of nickels and quarters, with a total value of $7.30. The number of nickels is six less than three times the number of quarters. How many nickels and how many quarters does he have? Solution Try It 5.91 Translate to a system of equations and solve: Matilda has a handful of quarters and dimes, with a total value of $8.55. The number of quarters is 3 more than twice the number of dimes. How many dimes and how many quarters does she have? Try It 5.92 Translate to a system of equations and solve: Juan has a pocketful of nickels and dimes. The total value of the coins is $8.10. The number of dimes is 9 less than twice the number of nickels. How many nickels and how many dimes does Juan have? Some mixture applications involve combining foods or drinks. Example situations might include combining raisins and nuts to make a trail mix or using two types of coffee beans to make a blend. Example 5.47 Translate to a system of equations and solve: Carson wants to make 20 pounds of trail mix using nuts and chocolate chips. His budget requires that the trail mix costs him $7.60 per pound. Nuts cost $9.00 per pound and chocolate chips cost $2.00 per pound. How many pounds of nuts and how many pounds of chocolate chips should he use? Solution Try It 5.93 Translate to a system of equations and solve: Greta wants to make 5 pounds of a nut mix using peanuts and cashews. Her budget requires the mixture to cost her $6 per pound. Peanuts are $4 per pound and cashews are $9 per pound. How many pounds of peanuts and how many pounds of cashews should she use? Try It 5.94 Translate to a system of equations and solve: Sammy has most of the ingredients he needs to make a large batch of chili. The only items he lacks are beans and ground beef. He needs a total of 20 pounds combined of beans and ground beef and has a budget of $3 per pound. The price of beans is $1 per pound and the price of ground beef is $5 per pound. How many pounds of beans and how many pounds of ground beef should he purchase? Another application of mixture problems relates to concentrated cleaning supplies, other chemicals, and mixed drinks. The concentration is given as a percent. For example, a 20% concentrated household cleanser means that 20% of the total amount is cleanser, and the rest is water. To make 35 ounces of a 20% concentration, you mix 7 ounces (20% of 35) of the cleanser with 28 ounces of water. For these kinds of mixture problems, we’ll use percent instead of value for one of the columns in our table. Example 5.48 Translate to a system of equations and solve: Sasheena is a lab assistant at her community college. She needs to make 200 milliliters of a 40% solution of sulfuric acid for a lab experiment. The lab has only 25% and 50% solutions in the storeroom. How much should she mix of the 25% and the 50% solutions to make the 40% solution? Solution Try It 5.95 Translate to a system of equations and solve: LeBron needs 150 milliliters of a 30% solution of sulfuric acid for a lab experiment but only has access to a 25% and a 50% solution. How much of the 25% and how much of the 50% solution should he mix to make the 30% solution? Try It 5.96 Translate to a system of equations and solve: Anatole needs to make 250 milliliters of a 25% solution of hydrochloric acid for a lab experiment. The lab only has a 10% solution and a 40% solution in the storeroom. How much of the 10% and how much of the 40% solutions should he mix to make the 25% solution?"

Page 56,"The formula to model interest applications is I = Prt. Interest, I, is the product of the principal, P, the rate, r, and the time, t. In our work here, we will calculate the interest earned in one year, so t will be 1. We modify the column titles in the mixture table to show the formula for interest, as you’ll see in Example 5.49. Example 5.49 Translate to a system of equations and solve: Adnan has $40,000 to invest and hopes to earn 7.1% interest per year. He will put some of the money into a stock fund that earns 8% per year and the rest into bonds that earns 3% per year. How much money should he put into each fund? Solution Did you notice that the Principal column represents the total amount of money invested while the Interest column represents only the interest earned? Likewise, the first equation in our system, s + b = 40,000, represents the total amount of money invested and the second equation, 0.08s + 0.03b = 0.071(40,000), represents the interest earned.

Page 57,"The definition of a system of linear inequalities is very similar to the definition of a system of linear equations. System of Linear Inequalities Two or more linear inequalities grouped together form a system of linear inequalities. system of linear inequalities A system of linear inequalities looks like a system of linear equations, but it has inequalities instead of equations. A system of two linear inequalities is shown below. To solve a system of linear inequalities, we will find values of the variables that are solutions to both inequalities. We solve the system by using the graphs of each inequality and show the solution as a graph. We will find the region on the plane that contains all ordered pairs (x,y)(x,y) that make both inequalities true. (x,y)(x,y) Solutions of a System of Linear Inequalities Solutions of a system of linear inequalities are the values of the variables that make all the inequalities true. The solution of a system of linear inequalities is shown as a shaded region in the x-y coordinate system that includes all the points whose ordered pairs make the inequalities true. To determine if an ordered pair is a solution to a system of two inequalities, we substitute the values of the variables into each inequality. If the ordered pair makes both inequalities true, it is a solution to the system. Example 5.51 Determine whether the ordered pair is a solution to the system. {x+4y≥103x−2y<12{x+4y≥103x−2y<12 {x+4y≥103x−2y<12{x+4y≥103x−2y<12 ⓐ (−2, 4) ⓑ (3,1) ⓐ ⓑ Solution ⓐ The ordered pair (−2, 4) made both inequalities true.

She wants to sell at least 60 drawings and has portraits and landscapes. She sells the portraits for $15 and the landscapes for $10. She needs to sell at least $800 worth of drawings in order to earn a profit. ⓐ ⓑ ⓒ ⓓ 316 . Jake does not want to spend more than $50 on bags of fertilizer and peat moss for his garden. Fertilizer costs $2 a bag and peat moss costs $5 a bag. Jake’s van can hold at most 20 bags. ⓐ ⓑ ⓒ ⓓ . Reiko needs to mail her Christmas cards and packages and wants to keep her mailing costs to no more than $500. The number of cards is at least 4 more than twice the number of packages. The cost of mailing a card (with pictures enclosed) is $3 and for a package the cost is $7. ⓐ ⓑ ⓒ ⓓ 318 . Juan is studying for his final exams in Chemistry and Algebra. He knows he only has 24 hours to study, and it will take him at least three times as long to study for Algebra than Chemistry. ⓐ ⓑ ⓒ ⓓ . Jocelyn is pregnant and needs to eat at least 500 more calories a day than usual. When buying groceries one day with a budget of $15 for the extra food, she buys bananas that have 90 calories each and chocolate granola bars that have 150 calories each. The bananas cost $0.35 each and the granola bars cost $2.50 each. ⓐ ⓑ ⓒ ⓓ 320 . Mark is attempting to build muscle mass and so he needs to eat at least an additional 80 grams of protein a day. A bottle of protein water costs $3.20 and a protein bar costs $1.75. The protein water supplies 27 grams of protein and the bar supplies 16 gram. If he has $ 10 dollars to spend ⓐ ⓑ ⓒ ⓓ . Jocelyn desires to increase both her protein consumption and caloric intake. She desires to have at least 35 more grams of protein each day and no more than an additional 200 calories daily. An ounce of cheddar cheese has 7 grams of protein and 110 calories. An ounce of parmesan cheese has 11 grams of protein and 22 calories. ⓐ ⓑ ⓒ ⓓ 322 . Mark is increasing his exercise routine by running and walking at least 4 miles each day. His goal is to burn a minimum of 1,500 calories from this exercise. Walking burns 270 calories/mile and running burns 650 calories. ⓐ Write a system of inequalities to model this situation.
ⓑ Graph the system.
ⓒ Could he meet his goal by walking 3 miles and running 1 mile?
ⓓ Could he meet his goal by walking 2 miles and running 2 mile? ⓐ ⓑ ⓒ ⓓ . Tickets for an American Baseball League game for 3 adults and 3 children cost less than $75, while tickets for 2 adults and 4 children cost less than $62. ⓐ ⓑ ⓒ ⓓ 324 . Grandpa and Grandma are treating their family to the movies. Matinee tickets cost $4 per child and $4 per adult. Evening tickets cost $6 per child and $8 per adult. They plan on spending no more than $80 on the matinee tickets and no more than $100 on the evening tickets. ⓐ ⓑ ⓒ ⓓ . Graph the inequality x−y≥3x−y≥3. How do you know which side of the line x−y=3x−y=3 should be shaded? x−y≥3x−y≥3 x−y=3x−y=3 326 . Graph the system {x+2y≤6y≥−12x−4{x+2y≤6y≥−12x−4.

Page 63,"You have learned how to simplify expressions by combining like terms. Remember, like terms must have the same variables with the same exponent. Since monomials are terms, adding and subtracting monomials is the same as combining like terms. If the monomials are like terms, we just combine them by adding or subtracting the coefficient.

Congratulations! You have achieved the objectives in this section. Reflect on the study skills you used so that you can continue to use them. What did you do to become confident of your ability to do these things? Be specific. …with some help. This must be addressed quickly because topics you do not master become potholes in your road to success. In math every topic builds upon previous work. It is important to make sure you have a strong foundation before you move on. Whom can you ask for help? Your fellow classmates and instructor are good resources. Is there a place on campus where math tutors are available? Can your study skills be improved? …no - I don’t get it! This is a warning sign and you must not ignore it. You should get help right away or you will quickly be overwhelmed. See your instructor as soon as you can to discuss your situation. Together you can come up with a plan to get you the help you need."

Page 64,"Remember that an exponent indicates repeated multiplication of the same quantity. For example, 2424 means to multiply 2 by itself 4 times, so 2424 means 2·2·2·22·2·2·2. 2424 2424 2·2·2·22·2·2·2 Let’s review the vocabulary for expressions with exponents. Exponential Notation This is read aa to the mthmth power. aa mthmth In the expression amam, the exponent mm tells us how many times we use the base aa as a factor. amam mm aa Before we begin working with variable expressions containing exponents, let’s simplify a few expressions involving only numbers. Example 6.16 Simplify: ⓐ 4343 ⓑ 7171 ⓒ (56)2(56)2 ⓓ (0.63)2.(0.63)2. ⓐ 4343 ⓑ 7171 ⓒ (56)2(56)2 ⓓ (0.63)2.(0.63)2.

Notice the similarities and differences in Example 6.17ⓐ and Example 6.17ⓑ ! Why are the answers different? As we follow the order of operations in part ⓐ the parentheses tell us to raise the (−5)(−5) to the 4th power. In part ⓑ we raise just the 5 to the 4th power and then take the opposite. ⓐ ⓑ ⓐ (−5)(−5) ⓑ"

Page 64,"You have seen that when you combine like terms by adding and subtracting, you need to have the same base with the same exponent. But when you multiply and divide, the exponents may be different, and sometimes the bases may be different, too. We’ll derive the properties of exponents by looking for patterns in several examples. First, we will look at an example that leads to the Product Property. We write: The base stayed the same and we added the exponents. This leads to the Product Property for Exponents. Product Property for Exponents If aa is a real number, and mandnmandn are counting numbers, then aa mandnmandn To multiply with like bases, add the exponents. An example with numbers helps to verify this property. Example 6.18 Simplify: y5·y6.y5·y6. y5·y6.y5·y6. Solution Try It 6.35 Simplify: b9·b8.b9·b8. b9·b8.b9·b8.

Page 64,"Now let’s look at an exponential expression that contains a power raised to a power. See if you can discover a general property. We write: We multiplied the exponents. This leads to the Power Property for Exponents. Power Property for Exponents If aa is a real number, and mandnmandn are whole numbers, then aa mandnmandn To raise a power to a power, multiply the exponents. An example with numbers helps to verify this property. Example 6.22 Simplify: ⓐ (y5)9(y5)9 ⓑ (44)7.(44)7. ⓐ (y5)9(y5)9 ⓑ (44)7.(44)7.

Page 64,"We will now look at an expression containing a product that is raised to a power. Can you find this pattern? Notice that each factor was raised to the power and (2x)3(2x)3 is 23·x323·x3. (2x)3(2x)3 23·x323·x3 The exponent applies to each of the factors! This leads to the Product to a Power Property for Exponents. Product to a Power Property for Exponents If aa and bb are real numbers and mm is a whole number, then aa bb mm To raise a product to a power, raise each factor to that power. An example with numbers helps to verify this property: Example 6.23 Simplify: ⓐ (−9d)2(−9d)2 ⓑ (3mn)3.(3mn)3. ⓐ (−9d)2(−9d)2 ⓑ (3mn)3.(3mn)3.

2 . Email Kate emails a flyer to ten of her friends and tells them to forward it to ten of their friends, who forward it to ten of their friends, and so on. The number of people who receive the email on the second round is 102102, on the third round is 103103, as shown in the table below. How many people will receive the email on the sixth round? Simplify the expression to show the number of people who receive the email. 102102 103103 166 . Salary Jamal’s boss gives him a 3% raise every year on his birthday. This means that each year, Jamal’s salary is 1.03 times his last year’s salary. If his original salary was $35,000, his salary after 1 year was $35,000(1.03)$35,000(1.03), after 2 years was $35,000(1.03)2$35,000(1.03)2, after 3 years was $35,000(1.03)3$35,000(1.03)3, as shown in the table below. What will Jamal’s salary be after 10 years? Simplify the expression, to show Jamal’s salary in dollars. $35,000(1.03)$35,000(1.03) $35,000(1.03)2$35,000(1.03)2 $35,000(1.03)3$35,000(1.03)3 . Clearance A department store is clearing out merchandise in order to make room for new inventory. The plan is to mark down items by 30% each week. This means that each week the cost of an item is 70% of the previous week’s cost. If the original cost of a sofa was $1,000, the cost for the first week would be $1,000(0.70)$1,000(0.70) and the cost of the item during the second week would be $1,000(0.70)2$1,000(0.70)2. Complete the table shown below. What will be the cost of the sofa during the fifth week? Simplify the expression, to show the cost in dollars. $1,000(0.70)$1,000(0.70) $1,000(0.70)2$1,000(0.70)2 168 . Depreciation Once a new car is driven away from the dealer, it begins to lose value. Each year, a car loses 10% of its value. This means that each year the value of a car is 90% of the previous year’s value. If a new car was purchased for $20,000, the value at the end of the first year would be $20,000(0.90)$20,000(0.90) and the value of the car after the end of the second year would be $20,000(0.90)2$20,000(0.90)2. Complete the table shown below. What will be the value of the car at the end of the eighth year? Simplify the expression, to show the value in dollars. $20,000(0.90)$20,000(0.90) $20,000(0.90)2$20,000(0.90)2 . Use the Product Property for Exponents to explain why x·x=x2x·x=x2. x·x=x2x·x=x2 170 .

Clearance A department store is clearing out merchandise in order to make room for new inventory. The plan is to mark down items by 30% each week. This means that each week the cost of an item is 70% of the previous week’s cost. If the original cost of a sofa was $1,000, the cost for the first week would be $1,000(0.70)$1,000(0.70) and the cost of the item during the second week would be $1,000(0.70)2$1,000(0.70)2.

Each year, a car loses 10% of its value. This means that each year the value of a car is 90% of the previous year’s value. If a new car was purchased for $20,000, the value at the end of the first year would be $20,000(0.90)$20,000(0.90) and the value of the car after the end of the second year would be $20,000(0.90)2$20,000(0.90)2.

Page 65,"Just like there are different ways to represent multiplication of numbers, there are several methods that can be used to multiply a binomial times a binomial. We will start by using the Distributive Property. binomial Look at Example 6.33, where we multiplied a binomial by a monomial. monomial Notice that before combining like terms, you had four terms. You multiplied the two terms of the first binomial by the two terms of the second binomial—four multiplications. Example 6.34 Multiply: (y+5)(y+8).(y+5)(y+8). (y+5)(y+8).(y+5)(y+8). Solution Try It 6.67 Multiply: (x+8)(x+9).(x+8)(x+9). (x+8)(x+9).(x+8)(x+9). Try It 6.68 Multiply: (5x+9)(4x+3).(5x+9)(4x+3). (5x+9)(4x+3).(5x+9)(4x+3). Example 6.35 Multiply: (2y+5)(3y+4).(2y+5)(3y+4). (2y+5)(3y+4).(2y+5)(3y+4). Solution Try It 6.69 Multiply: (3b+5)(4b+6).(3b+5)(4b+6). (3b+5)(4b+6).(3b+5)(4b+6). Try It 6.70 Multiply: (a+10)(a+7).(a+10)(a+7). (a+10)(a+7).(a+10)(a+7). Example 6.36 Multiply: (4y+3)(2y−5).(4y+3)(2y−5). (4y+3)(2y−5).(4y+3)(2y−5). Solution Try It 6.71 Multiply: (5y+2)(6y−3).(5y+2)(6y−3). (5y+2)(6y−3).(5y+2)(6y−3). Try It 6.72 Multiply: (3c+4)(5c−2).(3c+4)(5c−2). (3c+4)(5c−2).(3c+4)(5c−2). Example 6.37 Multiply: (x-2)(x−y).(x-2)(x−y). (x-2)(x−y).(x-2)(x−y). Solution Try It 6.73 Multiply: (a+7)(a−b).(a+7)(a−b). (a+7)(a−b).(a+7)(a−b). Try It 6.74 Multiply: (x+5)(x−y).(x+5)(x−y). (x+5)(x−y).(x+5)(x−y). Remember that when you multiply a binomial by a binomial you get four terms. Sometimes you can combine like terms to get a trinomial, but sometimes, like in Example 6.37, there are no like terms to combine. trinomial Let’s look at the last example again and pay particular attention to how we got the four terms. Where did the first term, x2x2, come from? x2x2 We abbreviate “First, Outer, Inner, Last” as FOIL. The letters stand for ‘First, Outer, Inner, Last’. The word FOIL is easy to remember and ensures we find all four products. Let’s look at (x+3)(x+7)(x+3)(x+7). (x+3)(x+7)(x+3)(x+7) Notice how the terms in third line fit the FOIL pattern. Now we will do an example where we use the FOIL pattern to multiply two binomials. Example 6.38 Multiply using the FOIL method: (x+5)(x+9).(x+5)(x+9). (x+5)(x+9).(x+5)(x+9). Solution Try It 6.75 Multiply using the FOIL method: (x+6)(x+8).(x+6)(x+8). (x+6)(x+8).(x+6)(x+8). Try It 6.76 Multiply using the FOIL method: (y+17)(y+3).(y+17)(y+3). (y+17)(y+3).(y+17)(y+3). We summarize the steps of the FOIL method below. The FOIL method only applies to multiplying binomials, not other polynomials! How To Multiply two binomials using the FOIL method When you multiply by the FOIL method, drawing the lines will help your brain focus on the pattern and make it easier to apply. Example 6.39 Multiply: (y−7)(y+4).(y−7)(y+4). (y−7)(y+4).(y−7)(y+4). Solution Try It 6.77 Multiply: (x−7)(x+5).(x−7)(x+5). (x−7)(x+5).(x−7)(x+5). Try It 6.78 Multiply: (b−3)(b+6).(b−3)(b+6). (b−3)(b+6).(b−3)(b+6). Example 6.40 Multiply: (4x+3)(2x−5).(4x+3)(2x−5). (4x+3)(2x−5).(4x+3)(2x−5). Solution Try It 6.79 Multiply: (3x+7)(5x−2).(3x+7)(5x−2). (3x+7)(5x−2).(3x+7)(5x−2). Try It 6.80 Multiply: (4y+5)(4y−10).(4y+5)(4y−10). (4y+5)(4y−10).(4y+5)(4y−10). The final products in the last four examples were trinomials because we could combine the two middle terms. This is not always the case. Example 6.41 Multiply: (3x−y)(2x−5).(3x−y)(2x−5). (3x−y)(2x−5).(3x−y)(2x−5). Solution Try It 6.81 Multiply: (10c−d)(c−6).(10c−d)(c−6). (10c−d)(c−6).(10c−d)(c−6). Try It 6.82 Multiply: (7x−y)(2x−5).(7x−y)(2x−5). (7x−y)(2x−5).(7x−y)(2x−5). Be careful of the exponents in the next example. Example 6.42 Multiply: (n2+4)(n−1).(n2+4)(n−1). (n2+4)(n−1).(n2+4)(n−1). Solution Try It 6.83 Multiply: (x2+6)(x−8).(x2+6)(x−8). (x2+6)(x−8).(x2+6)(x−8). Try It 6.84 Multiply: (y2+7)(y−9).(y2+7)(y−9). (y2+7)(y−9).(y2+7)(y−9). Example 6.43 Multiply: (3pq+5)(6pq−11).(3pq+5)(6pq−11). (3pq+5)(6pq−11).(3pq+5)(6pq−11). Solution Try It 6.85 Multiply: (2ab+5)(4ab−4).(2ab+5)(4ab−4). (2ab+5)(4ab−4).(2ab+5)(4ab−4). Try It 6.86 Multiply: (2xy+3)(4xy−5).(2xy+3)(4xy−5). (2xy+3)(4xy−5).(2xy+3)(4xy−5). The FOIL method is usually the quickest method for multiplying two binomials, but it only works for binomials. You can use the Distributive Property to find the product of any two polynomials. Another method that works for all polynomials is the Vertical Method. It is very much like the method you use to multiply whole numbers. Look carefully at this example of multiplying two-digit numbers. Now we’ll apply this same method to multiply two binomials. Example 6.44 Multiply using the Vertical Method: (3y−1)(2y−6).(3y−1)(2y−6). (3y−1)(2y−6).(3y−1)(2y−6). Solution It does not matter which binomial goes on the top. Multiply

Example 6.43 Multiply: (3pq+5)(6pq−11).(3pq+5)(6pq−11). (3pq+5)(6pq−11).(3pq+5)(6pq−11). Solution Try It 6.85 Multiply: (2ab+5)(4ab−4).(2ab+5)(4ab−4). (2ab+5)(4ab−4).(2ab+5)(4ab−4). Try It 6.86 Multiply: (2xy+3)(4xy−5).(2xy+3)(4xy−5). (2xy+3)(4xy−5).(2xy+3)(4xy−5)."
Page 65,"The FOIL method is usually the quickest method for multiplying two binomials, but it only works for binomials. You can use the Distributive Property to find the product of any two polynomials. Another method that works for all polynomials is the Vertical Method. It is very much like the method you use to multiply whole numbers. Look carefully at this example of multiplying two-digit numbers. Now we’ll apply this same method to multiply two binomials. Example 6.44 Multiply using the Vertical Method: (3y−1)(2y−6).(3y−1)(2y−6). (3y−1)(2y−6).(3y−1)(2y−6). Solution It does not matter which binomial goes on the top. Multiply

Try It 6.88 Multiply using the Vertical Method: (6b−5)(7b−3).(6b−5)(7b−3). (6b−5)(7b−3).(6b−5)(7b−3). We have now used three methods for multiplying binomials. Be sure to practice each method, and try to decide which one you prefer. The methods are listed here all together, to help you remember them. Multiplying Two Binomials To multiply binomials, use the: Remember, FOIL only works when multiplying two binomials."
Page 65,"We have multiplied monomials by monomials, monomials by polynomials, and binomials by binomials. Now we’re ready to multiply a trinomial by a binomial. Remember, FOIL will not work in this case, but we can use either the Distributive Property or the Vertical Method. We first look at an example using the Distributive Property. trinomial binomial Example 6.45 Multiply using the Distributive Property: (b+3)(2b2−5b+8).(b+3)(2b2−5b+8). (b+3)(2b2−5b+8).(b+3)(2b2−5b+8). Solution Try It 6.89 Multiply using the Distributive Property: (y−3)(y2−5y+2).(y−3)(y2−5y+2). (y−3)(y2−5y+2).(y−3)(y2−5y+2). Try It 6.90 Multiply using the Distributive Property: (x+4)(2x2−3x+5).(x+4)(2x2−3x+5). (x+4)(2x2−3x+5).(x+4)(2x2−3x+5). Now let’s do this same multiplication using the Vertical Method. Example 6.46 Multiply using the Vertical Method: (b+3)(2b2−5b+8).(b+3)(2b2−5b+8). (b+3)(2b2−5b+8).(b+3)(2b2−5b+8). Solution It is easier to put the polynomial with fewer terms on the bottom because we get fewer partial products this way. Try It 6.91 Multiply using the Vertical Method: (y−3)(y2−5y+2).(y−3)(y2−5y+2). (y−3)(y2−5y+2).(y−3)(y2−5y+2). Try It 6.92 Multiply using the Vertical Method: (x+4)(2x2−3x+5).(x+4)(2x2−3x+5). (x+4)(2x2−3x+5).(x+4)(2x2−3x+5). We have now seen two methods you can use to multiply a trinomial by a binomial. After you practice each method, you’ll probably find you prefer one way over the other. We list both methods are listed here, for easy reference. trinomial Multiplying a Trinomial by a Binomial To multiply a trinomial by a binomial, use the: Media Access these online resources for additional instruction and practice with multiplying polynomials:"

Page 66,"Mathematicians like to look for patterns that will make their work easier. A good example of this is squaring binomials. While you can always get the product by writing the binomial twice and using the methods of the last section, there is less work to do if you learn to use a pattern. binomial Look at these results. Do you see any patterns? What about the number of terms? In each example we squared a binomial and the result was a trinomial. trinomial Now look at the first term in each result. Where did it come from? The first term is the product of the first terms of each binomial. Since the binomials are identical, it is just the square of the first term! To get the first term of the product, square the first term. Where did the last term come from? Look at the examples and find the pattern. The last term is the product of the last terms, which is the square of the last term. To get the last term of the product, square the last term. Finally, look at the middle term. Notice it came from adding the “outer” and the “inner” terms—which are both the same! So the middle term is double the product of the two terms of the binomial. To get the middle term of the product, multiply the terms and double their product. Putting it all together: Binomial Squares Pattern If aandbaandb are real numbers, aandbaandb To square a binomial: A number example helps verify the pattern. To multiply (10+4)2(10+4)2 usually you’d follow the Order of Operations. (10+4)2(10+4)2 The pattern works! Example 6.47 Multiply: (x+5)2.(x+5)2. (x+5)2.(x+5)2.

Page 66,"We just saw a pattern for squaring binomials that we can use to make multiplying some binomials easier. Similarly, there is a pattern for another product of binomials. But before we get to it, we need to introduce some vocabulary. What do you notice about these pairs of binomials? Look at the first term of each binomial in each pair. binomial Notice the first terms are the same in each pair. Look at the last terms of each binomial in each pair. Notice the last terms are the same in each pair. Notice how each pair has one sum and one difference. A pair of binomials that each have the same first term and the same last term, but one is a sum and one is a difference has a special name. It is called a conjugate pair and is of the form (a−b),(a+b)(a−b),(a+b). (a−b),(a+b)(a−b),(a+b) Conjugate Pair A conjugate pair is two binomials of the form conjugate pair The pair of binomials each have the same first term and the same last term, but one binomial is a sum and the other is a difference. There is a nice pattern for finding the product of conjugates. You could, of course, simply FOIL to get the product, but using the pattern makes your work easier. Let’s look for the pattern by using FOIL to multiply some conjugate pairs. Each first term is the product of the first terms of the binomials, and since they are identical it is the square of the first term. The last term came from multiplying the last terms, the square of the last term. What do you observe about the products? The product of the two binomials is also a binomial! Most of the products resulting from FOIL have been trinomials. Why is there no middle term? Notice the two middle terms you get from FOIL combine to 0 in every case, the result of one addition and one subtraction. The product of conjugates is always of the form a2−b2a2−b2. This is called a difference of squares. a2−b2a2−b2 This leads to the pattern: Product of Conjugates Pattern If aandbaandb are real numbers, aandbaandb The product is called a difference of squares. To multiply conjugates, square the first term, square the last term, and write the product as a difference of squares. Let’s test this pattern with a numerical example. Notice, the result is the same! Example 6.52 Multiply: (x−8)(x+8).(x−8)(x+8). (x−8)(x+8).(x−8)(x+8). Solution First, recognize this as a product of conjugates. The binomials have the same first terms, and the same last terms, and one binomial is a sum and the other is a difference. Try It 6.103 Multiply: (x−5)(x+5).(x−5)(x+5). (x−5)(x+5).(x−5)(x+5). Try It 6.104 Multiply: (w−3)(w+3).(w−3)(w+3). (w−3)(w+3).(w−3)(w+3). Example 6.53 Multiply: (2x+5)(2x−5).(2x+5)(2x−5). (2x+5)(2x−5).(2x+5)(2x−5). Solution Are the binomials conjugates? Try It 6.105 Multiply: (6x+5)(6x−5).(6x+5)(6x−5). (6x+5)(6x−5).(6x+5)(6x−5). Try It 6.106 Multiply: (2x+7)(2x−7).(2x+7)(2x−7). (2x+7)(2x−7).(2x+7)(2x−7). The binomials in the next example may look backwards – the variable is in the second term. But the two binomials are still conjugates, so we use the same pattern to multiply them. Example 6.54 Find the product: (3+5x)(3−5x).(3+5x)(3−5x). (3+5x)(3−5x).(3+5x)(3−5x). Solution Try It 6.107 Multiply: (7+4x)(7−4x).(7+4x)(7−4x). (7+4x)(7−4x).(7+4x)(7−4x). Try It 6.108 Multiply: (9−2y)(9+2y).(9−2y)(9+2y). (9−2y)(9+2y).(9−2y)(9+2y). Now we’ll multiply conjugates that have two variables. Example 6.55 Find the product: (5m−9n)(5m+9n).(5m−9n)(5m+9n). (5m−9n)(5m+9n).(5m−9n)(5m+9n). Solution Try It 6.109 Find the product: (4p−7q)(4p+7q).(4p−7q)(4p+7q). (4p−7q)(4p+7q).(4p−7q)(4p+7q). Try It 6.110 Find the product: (3x−y)(3x+y).(3x−y)(3x+y). (3x−y)(3x+y).(3x−y)(3x+y). Example 6.56 Find the product: (cd−8)(cd+8).(cd−8)(cd+8). (cd−8)(cd+8).(cd−8)(cd+8). Solution Try It 6.111 Find the product: (xy−6)(xy+6).(xy−6)(xy+6). (xy−6)(xy+6).(xy−6)(xy+6). Try It 6.112 Find the product: (ab−9)(ab+9).(ab−9)(ab+9). (ab−9)(ab+9).(ab−9)(ab+9). Example 6.57 Find the product: (6u2−11v5)(6u2+11v5).(6u2−11v5)(6u2+11v5). (6u2−11v5)(6u2+11v5).(6u2−11v5)(6u2+11v5). Solution Try It 6.113 Find the product: (3x2−4y3)(3x2+4y3).(3x2−4y3)(3x2+4y3). (3x2−4y3)(3x2+4y3).(3x2−4y3)(3x2+4y3). Try It 6.114 Find the product: (2m2−5n3)(2m2+5n3).(2m2−5n3)(2m2+5n3). (2m2−5n3)(2m2+5n3).(2m2−5n3)(2m2+5n3)."
Page 66,"We just developed special product patterns for Binomial Squares and for the Product of Conjugates. The products look similar, so it is important to recognize when it is appropriate to use each of these patterns and to notice how they differ. Look at the two patterns together and note their similarities and differences. Comparing the Special Product Patterns Example 6.58 Choose the appropriate pattern and use it to find the product: ⓐ (2x−3)(2x+3)(2x−3)(2x+3) ⓑ (8x−5)2(8x−5)2 ⓒ (6m+7)2(6m+7)2 ⓓ (5x−6)(6x+5)(5x−6)(6x+5) ⓐ (2x−3)(2x+3)(2x−3)(2x+3) ⓑ (8x−5)2(8x−5)2 ⓒ (6m+7)2(6m+7)2 ⓓ (5x−6)(6x+5)(5x−6)(6x+5) Solution ⓐ ⓑ ⓒ ⓓ Try It 6.115 Choose the appropriate pattern and use it to find the product: ⓐ (9b−2)(2b+9)(9b−2)(2b+9) ⓑ (9p−4)2(9p−4)2 ⓒ (7y+1)2(7y+1)2 ⓓ (4r−3)(4r+3)(4r−3)(4r+3) ⓐ (9b−2)(2b+9)(9b−2)(2b+9) ⓑ (9p−4)2(9p−4)2 ⓒ (7y+1)2(7y+1)2 ⓓ (4r−3)(4r+3)(4r−3)(4r+3) Try It 6.116 Choose the appropriate pattern and use it to find the product: ⓐ (6x+7)2(6x+7)2 ⓑ (3x−4)(3x+4)(3x−4)(3x+4) ⓒ (2x−5)(5x−2)(2x−5)(5x−2) ⓓ (6n−1)2(6n−1)2 ⓐ (6x+7)2(6x+7)2 ⓑ (3x−4)(3x+4)(3x−4)(3x+4) ⓒ (2x−5)(5x−2)(2x−5)(5x−2) ⓓ (6n−1)2(6n−1)2 Media Access these online resources for additional instruction and practice with special products:"

Mental math You can use the product of conjugates pattern to multiply numbers without a calculator. Say you need to multiply 47 times 53. Think of 47 as 50−350−3 and 53 as 50+350+3. 50−350−3 50+350+3 ⓐ ⓑ ⓒ . Mental math You can use the binomial squares pattern to multiply numbers without a calculator. Say you need to square 65. Think of 65 as 60+560+5. 60+560+5 ⓐ ⓑ ⓒ 352 . How do you decide which pattern to use? . Why does (a+b)2(a+b)2 result in a trinomial, but (a−b)(a+b)(a−b)(a+b) result in a binomial? (a+b)2(a+b)2 (a−b)(a+b)(a−b)(a+b) 354 . Marta did the following work on her homework paper: Explain what is wrong with Marta’s work. . Use the order of operations to show that (3+5)2(3+5)2 is 64, and then use that numerical example to explain why (a+b)2≠a2+b2(a+b)2≠a2+b2. (3+5)2(3+5)2 (a+b)2≠a2+b2(a+b)2≠a2+b2 ⓐ After completing the exercises, use this checklist to evaluate your mastery of the objectives of this section. ⓐ ⓑ On a scale of 1-10, how would you rate your mastery of this section in light of your responses on the checklist?

Page 67,"Earlier in this chapter, we developed the properties of exponents for multiplication. We summarize these properties below. Summary of Exponent Properties for Multiplication If aandbaandb are real numbers, and mandnmandn are whole numbers, then aandbaandb mandnmandn Now we will look at the exponent properties for division. A quick memory refresher may help before we get started. You have learned to simplify fractions by dividing out common factors from the numerator and denominator using the Equivalent Fractions Property. This property will also help you work with algebraic fractions—which are also quotients. Equivalent Fractions Property If a,b,andca,b,andc are whole numbers where b≠0,c≠0b≠0,c≠0, a,b,andca,b,andc b≠0,c≠0b≠0,c≠0 As before, we’ll try to discover a property by looking at some examples. Notice, in each case the bases were the same and we subtracted exponents. When the larger exponent was in the numerator, we were left with factors in the numerator. When the larger exponent was in the denominator, we were left with factors in the denominator—notice the numerator of 1. We write: This leads to the Quotient Property for Exponents. Quotient Property for Exponents If aa is a real number, a≠0a≠0, and mandnmandn are whole numbers, then aa a≠0a≠0 mandnmandn A couple of examples with numbers may help to verify this property. Example 6.59 Simplify: ⓐ x9x7x9x7 ⓑ 31032.31032. ⓐ x9x7x9x7 ⓑ 31032.31032. Solution To simplify an expression with a quotient, we need to first compare the exponents in the numerator and denominator. ⓐ ⓑ Try It 6.117 Simplify: ⓐ x15x10x15x10 ⓑ 61465.61465. ⓐ x15x10x15x10 ⓑ 61465.61465.

Notice the difference in the two previous examples: The first step in simplifying an expression using the Quotient Property for Exponents is to determine whether the exponent is larger in the numerator or the denominator.

Page 67,"Solution To simplify an expression with a quotient, we need to first compare the exponents in the numerator and denominator. ⓐ ⓑ"
Page 67,"A special case of the Quotient Property is when the exponents of the numerator and denominator are equal, such as an expression like amamamam. From your earlier work with fractions, you know that: amamamam In words, a number divided by itself is 1. So, xx=1xx=1, for any x(x≠0)x(x≠0), since any number divided by itself is 1. xx=1xx=1 x(x≠0)x(x≠0) The Quotient Property for Exponents shows us how to simplify amanaman when m>nm>n and when n<mn<m by subtracting exponents. What if m=nm=n? amanaman m>nm>n n<mn<m m=nm=n Consider 8888, which we know is 1. 8888 Now we will simplify amamamam in two ways to lead us to the definition of the zero exponent. In general, for a≠0a≠0: amamamam a≠0a≠0 We see amamamam simplifies to a0a0 and to 1. So a0=1a0=1. amamamam a0a0 a0=1a0=1 Zero Exponent If aa is a non-zero number, then a0=1a0=1. aa a0=1a0=1 Any nonzero number raised to the zero power is 1. In this text, we assume any variable that we raise to the zero power is not zero. Example 6.62 Simplify: ⓐ 9090 ⓑ n0.n0. ⓐ 9090 ⓑ n0.n0. Solution The definition says any non-zero number raised to the zero power is 1. ⓐ ⓑ Try It 6.123 Simplify: ⓐ 150150 ⓑ m0.m0. ⓐ 150150 ⓑ m0.m0. Try It 6.124 Simplify: ⓐ k0k0 ⓑ 290.290. ⓐ k0k0 ⓑ 290.290. Now that we have defined the zero exponent, we can expand all the Properties of Exponents to include whole number exponents. What about raising an expression to the zero power? Let’s look at (2x)0(2x)0. We can use the product to a power rule to rewrite this expression. (2x)0(2x)0 Table 6.1 This tells us that any nonzero expression raised to the zero power is one. Example 6.63 Simplify: ⓐ (5b)0(5b)0 ⓑ (−4a2b)0.(−4a2b)0. ⓐ (5b)0(5b)0 ⓑ (−4a2b)0.(−4a2b)0.

Page 67,"Now we will look at an example that will lead us to the Quotient to a Power Property. Notice that the exponent applies to both the numerator and the denominator. This leads to the Quotient to a Power Property for Exponents. Quotient to a Power Property for Exponents If aa and bb are real numbers, b≠0b≠0, and mm is a counting number, then aa bb b≠0b≠0 mm To raise a fraction to a power, raise the numerator and denominator to that power. An example with numbers may help you understand this property: Example 6.64 Simplify: ⓐ (37)2(37)2 ⓑ (b3)4(b3)4 ⓒ (kj)3.(kj)3. ⓐ (37)2(37)2 ⓑ (b3)4(b3)4 ⓒ (kj)3.(kj)3.

Page 68,"In the last section, you learned how to divide a monomial by a monomial. As you continue to build up your knowledge of polynomials the next procedure is to divide a polynomial of two or more terms by a monomial. monomial The method we’ll use to divide a polynomial by a monomial is based on the properties of fraction addition. So we’ll start with an example to review fraction addition. Table 6.2 Now we will do this in reverse to split a single fraction into separate fractions. We’ll state the fraction addition property here just as you learned it and in reverse. Fraction Addition If a,b,andca,b,andc are numbers where c≠0c≠0, then a,b,andca,b,andc c≠0c≠0 We use the form on the left to add fractions and we use the form on the right to divide a polynomial by a monomial. Table 6.3 We use this form of fraction addition to divide polynomials by monomials. Division of a Polynomial by a Monomial To divide a polynomial by a monomial, divide each term of the polynomial by the monomial. monomial Example 6.77 Find the quotient: 7y2+217.7y2+217. 7y2+217.7y2+217.

Remember that division can be represented as a fraction. When you are asked to divide a polynomial by a monomial and it is not already in fraction form, write a fraction with the polynomial in the numerator and the monomial in the denominator. Example 6.78 Find the quotient: (18x3−36x2)÷6x.(18x3−36x2)÷6x. (18x3−36x2)÷6x.(18x3−36x2)÷6x. Solution Try It 6.155 Find the quotient: (27b3−33b2)÷3b.(27b3−33b2)÷3b. (27b3−33b2)÷3b.(27b3−33b2)÷3b.

Page 68,"To divide a polynomial by a binomial, we follow a procedure very similar to long division of numbers. So let’s look carefully the steps we take when we divide a 3-digit number, 875, by a 2-digit number, 25. binomial We check division by multiplying the quotient by the divisor. If we did the division correctly, the product should equal the dividend. Now we will divide a trinomial by a binomial. As you read through the example, notice how similar the steps are to the numerical example above. trinomial Example 6.84 Find the quotient: (x2+9x+20)÷(x+5).(x2+9x+20)÷(x+5). (x2+9x+20)÷(x+5).(x2+9x+20)÷(x+5). Solution Try It 6.167 Find the quotient: (y2+10y+21)÷(y+3).(y2+10y+21)÷(y+3). (y2+10y+21)÷(y+3).(y2+10y+21)÷(y+3). Try It 6.168 Find the quotient: (m2+9m+20)÷(m+4).(m2+9m+20)÷(m+4). (m2+9m+20)÷(m+4).(m2+9m+20)÷(m+4). When the divisor has subtraction sign, we must be extra careful when we multiply the partial quotient and then subtract. It may be safer to show that we change the signs and then add. Example 6.85 Find the quotient: (2x2−5x−3)÷(x−3).(2x2−5x−3)÷(x−3). (2x2−5x−3)÷(x−3).(2x2−5x−3)÷(x−3). Solution Try It 6.169 Find the quotient: (2x2−3x−20)÷(x−4).(2x2−3x−20)÷(x−4). (2x2−3x−20)÷(x−4).(2x2−3x−20)÷(x−4). Try It 6.170 Find the quotient: (3x2−16x−12)÷(x−6).(3x2−16x−12)÷(x−6). (3x2−16x−12)÷(x−6).(3x2−16x−12)÷(x−6). When we divided 875 by 25, we had no remainder. But sometimes division of numbers does leave a remainder. The same is true when we divide polynomials. In Example 6.86, we’ll have a division that leaves a remainder. We write the remainder as a fraction with the divisor as the denominator. Example 6.86 Find the quotient: (x3−x2+x+4)÷(x+1).(x3−x2+x+4)÷(x+1). (x3−x2+x+4)÷(x+1).(x3−x2+x+4)÷(x+1). Solution Try It 6.171 Find the quotient: (x3+5x2+8x+6)÷(x+2).(x3+5x2+8x+6)÷(x+2). (x3+5x2+8x+6)÷(x+2).(x3+5x2+8x+6)÷(x+2). Try It 6.172 Find the quotient: (2x3+8x2+x−8)÷(x+1).(2x3+8x2+x−8)÷(x+1). (2x3+8x2+x−8)÷(x+1).(2x3+8x2+x−8)÷(x+1). Look back at the dividends in Example 6.84, Example 6.85, and Example 6.86. The terms were written in descending order of degrees, and there were no missing degrees. The dividend in Example 6.87 will be x4−x2+5x−2x4−x2+5x−2. It is missing an x3x3 term. We will add in 0x30x3 as a placeholder. x4−x2+5x−2x4−x2+5x−2 x3x3 0x30x3 Example 6.87 Find the quotient: (x4−x2+5x−2)÷(x+2).(x4−x2+5x−2)÷(x+2). (x4−x2+5x−2)÷(x+2).(x4−x2+5x−2)÷(x+2). Solution Notice that there is no x3x3 term in the dividend. We will add 0x30x3 as a placeholder. x3x3 0x30x3 Try It 6.173 Find the quotient: (x3+3x+14)÷(x+2).(x3+3x+14)÷(x+2). (x3+3x+14)÷(x+2).(x3+3x+14)÷(x+2). Try It 6.174 Find the quotient: (x4−3x3−1000)÷(x+5).(x4−3x3−1000)÷(x+5). (x4−3x3−1000)÷(x+5).(x4−3x3−1000)÷(x+5). In Example 6.88, we will divide by 2a−32a−3. As we divide we will have to consider the constants as well as the variables. 2a−32a−3 Example 6.88 Find the quotient: (8a3+27)÷(2a+3).(8a3+27)÷(2a+3). (8a3+27)÷(2a+3).(8a3+27)÷(2a+3). Solution This time we will show the division all in one step. We need to add two placeholders in order to divide. To check, multiply (2a+3)(4a2−6a+9)(2a+3)(4a2−6a+9). (2a+3)(4a2−6a+9)(2a+3)(4a2−6a+9) The result should be 8a3+278a3+27. 8a3+278a3+27 Try It 6.175 Find the quotient: (x3−64)÷(x−4).(x3−64)÷(x−4). (x3−64)÷(x−4).(x3−64)÷(x−4). Try It 6.176 Find the quotient: (125x3−8)÷(5x−2).(125x3−8)÷(5x−2). (125x3−8)÷(5x−2).(125x3−8)÷(5x−2).

Page 69,"We saw that the Quotient Property for Exponents introduced earlier in this chapter, has two forms depending on whether the exponent is larger in the numerator or the denominator. Quotient Property for Exponents If aa is a real number, a≠0a≠0, and mandnmandn are whole numbers, then aa a≠0a≠0 mandnmandn What if we just subtract exponents regardless of which is larger? Let’s consider x2x5x2x5. x2x5x2x5 We subtract the exponent in the denominator from the exponent in the numerator. We can also simplify x2x5x2x5 by dividing out common factors: x2x5x2x5 This implies that x−3=1x3x−3=1x3 and it leads us to the definition of a negative exponent. x−3=1x3x−3=1x3 Negative Exponent If nn is an integer and a≠0a≠0, then a−n=1ana−n=1an. nn a≠0a≠0 a−n=1ana−n=1an The negative exponent tells us we can re-write the expression by taking the reciprocal of the base and then changing the sign of the exponent. negative exponent Any expression that has negative exponents is not considered to be in simplest form. We will use the definition of a negative exponent and other properties of exponents to write the expression with only positive exponents. negative exponent For example, if after simplifying an expression we end up with the expression x−3x−3, we will take one more step and write 1x31x3. The answer is considered to be in simplest form when it has only positive exponents. x−3x−3 1x31x3 Example 6.89 Simplify: ⓐ 4−24−2 ⓑ 10−3.10−3. ⓐ 4−24−2 ⓑ 10−3.10−3.

In Example 6.89 we raised an integer to a negative exponent. What happens when we raise a fraction to a negative exponent? We’ll start by looking at what happens to a fraction whose numerator is one and whose denominator is an integer raised to a negative exponent. This leads to the Property of Negative Exponents. Property of Negative Exponents If nn is an integer and a≠0a≠0, then 1a−n=an1a−n=an. nn a≠0a≠0 1a−n=an1a−n=an Example 6.90 Simplify: ⓐ 1y−41y−4 ⓑ 13−2.13−2. ⓐ 1y−41y−4 ⓑ 13−2.13−2.

Suppose now we have a fraction raised to a negative exponent. Let’s use our definition of negative exponents to lead us to a new property. Table 6.4 To get from the original fraction raised to a negative exponent to the final result, we took the reciprocal of the base—the fraction—and changed the sign of the exponent. This leads us to the Quotient to a Negative Power Property. Quotient to a Negative Exponent Property If aandbaandb are real numbers, a≠0,b≠0,a≠0,b≠0, and nn is an integer, then (ab)−n=(ba)n(ab)−n=(ba)n. aandbaandb a≠0,b≠0,a≠0,b≠0, nn (ab)−n=(ba)n(ab)−n=(ba)n Example 6.91 Simplify: ⓐ (57)−2(57)−2 ⓑ (−2xy)−3.(−2xy)−3. ⓐ (57)−2(57)−2 ⓑ (−2xy)−3.(−2xy)−3.

We must be careful to follow the Order of Operations. In the next example, parts (a) and (b) look similar, but the results are different.

We will assume all variables are non-zero. Example 6.94 Simplify: ⓐ x−6x−6 ⓑ (u4)−3.(u4)−3. ⓐ x−6x−6 ⓑ (u4)−3.(u4)−3.

When there is a product and an exponent we have to be careful to apply the exponent to the correct quantity. According to the Order of Operations, we simplify expressions in parentheses before applying exponents. We’ll see how this works in the next example.

When the exponent in the denominator is larger than the exponent in the numerator, the exponent of the quotient will be negative. aman=am−naman=am−n a≠0a≠0"

In the next two examples, we’ll start by using the Commutative Property to group the same variables together. This makes it easier to identify the like bases before using the Product Property.

Page 69,"Remember working with place value for whole numbers and decimals? Our number system is based on powers of 10. We use tens, hundreds, thousands, and so on. Our decimal numbers are also based on powers of tens—tenths, hundredths, thousandths, and so on. Consider the numbers 4,000 and 0.0040.004. We know that 4,000 means 4×1,0004×1,000 and 0.004 means 4×11,0004×11,000. 0.0040.004 4×1,0004×1,000 4×11,0004×11,000 If we write the 1000 as a power of ten in exponential form, we can rewrite these numbers in this way: When a number is written as a product of two numbers, where the first factor is a number greater than or equal to one but less than 10, and the second factor is a power of 10 written in exponential form, it is said to be in scientific notation.

Now we will factor expressions and find the greatest common factor of two or more expressions. The method we use is similar to what we used to find the LCM. greatest common factor Greatest Common Factor The greatest common factor (GCF) of two or more expressions is the largest expression that is a factor of all the expressions. greatest common factor First we’ll find the GCF of two numbers. Example 7.1 Find the GCF of 54 and 36. Solution Notice that, because the GCF is a factor of both numbers, 54 and 36 can be written as multiples of 18. Try It 7.1 Find the GCF of 48 and 80. Try It 7.2 Find the GCF of 18 and 40. We summarize the steps we use to find the GCF below. How To Find the Greatest Common Factor (GCF) of two expressions. Step 1. Factor each coefficient into primes. Write all variables with exponents in expanded form. Step 2. List all factors—matching common factors in a column. In each column, circle the common factors. Step 3. Bring down the common factors that all expressions share. Step 4. Multiply the factors. In the first example, the GCF was a constant. In the next two examples, we will get variables in the greatest common factor.

Page 75,"Just like in arithmetic, where it is sometimes useful to represent a number in factored form (for example, 12 as 2·6or3·4),2·6or3·4), in algebra, it can be useful to represent a polynomial in factored form. One way to do this is by finding the GCF of all the terms. Remember, we multiply a polynomial by a monomial as follows: 2·6or3·4),2·6or3·4), Now we will start with a product, like 2x+142x+14, and end with its factors, 2(x+7)2(x+7). To do this we apply the Distributive Property “in reverse.” 2x+142x+14 2(x+7)2(x+7) We state the Distributive Property here just as you saw it in earlier chapters and “in reverse.” Distributive Property If a,b,ca,b,c are real numbers, then a,b,ca,b,c The form on the left is used to multiply. The form on the right is used to factor. So how do you use the Distributive Property to factor a polynomial? You just find the GCF of all the terms and write the polynomial as a product! Example 7.5 Factor: 4x+124x+12. 4x+124x+12 Solution Try It 7.9 Factor: 6a+246a+24. 6a+246a+24 Try It 7.10 Factor: 2b+142b+14. 2b+142b+14 How To Factor the greatest common factor from a polynomial. Step 1. Find the GCF of all the terms of the polynomial. Step 2. Rewrite each term as a product using the GCF. Step 3. Use the “reverse” Distributive Property to factor the expression. Step 4. Check by multiplying the factors. Factor as a Noun and a Verb We use “factor” as both a noun and a verb. Example 7.6 Factor: 5a+55a+5. 5a+55a+5 Solution Try It 7.11 Factor: 14x+1414x+14. 14x+1414x+14 Try It 7.12 Factor: 12p+1212p+12. 12p+1212p+12 The expressions in the next example have several factors in common. Remember to write the GCF as the product of all the common factors. Example 7.7 Factor: 12x−6012x−60. 12x−6012x−60 Solution Try It 7.13 Factor: 18u−3618u−36. 18u−3618u−36 Try It 7.14 Factor: 30y−6030y−60. 30y−6030y−60 Now we’ll factor the greatest common factor from a trinomial. We start by finding the GCF of all three terms. Example 7.8 Factor: 4y2+24y+284y2+24y+28. 4y2+24y+284y2+24y+28 Solution We start by finding the GCF of all three terms.

Page 75,"When there is no common factor of all the terms of a polynomial, look for a common factor in just some of the terms. When there are four terms, a good way to start is by separating the polynomial into two parts with two terms in each part. Then look for the GCF in each part. If the polynomial can be factored, you will find a common factor emerges from both parts. (Not all polynomials can be factored. Just like some numbers are prime, some polynomials are prime.) Example 7.15 Factor: xy+3y+2x+6xy+3y+2x+6. xy+3y+2x+6xy+3y+2x+6 Solution Try It 7.29 Factor: xy+8y+3x+24xy+8y+3x+24. xy+8y+3x+24xy+8y+3x+24 Try It 7.30 Factor: ab+7b+8a+56ab+7b+8a+56. ab+7b+8a+56ab+7b+8a+56 How To Factor by grouping. Step 1. Group terms with common factors. Step 2. Factor out the common factor in each group. Step 3. Factor the common factor from the expression. Step 4. Check by multiplying the factors.

3 . Area of a rectangle The area of a rectangle with length 6 less than the width is given by the expression w2−6ww2−6w, where w=w= width. Factor the greatest common factor from the polynomial. w2−6ww2−6w w=w= 60 . Height of a baseball The height of a baseball t seconds after it is hit is given by the expression −16t2+80t+4−16t2+80t+4. Factor the greatest common factor from the polynomial. −16t2+80t+4−16t2+80t+4 . The greatest common factor of 36 and 60 is 12. Explain what this means. 62 . What is the GCF of y4,y5,andy10y4,y5,andy10? Write a general rule that tells you how to find the GCF of ya,yb,andycya,yb,andyc. y4,y5,andy10y4,y5,andy10 ya,yb,andycya,yb,andyc ⓐ After completing the exercises, use this checklist to evaluate your mastery of the objectives of this section. ⓐ ⓑ If most of your checks were: ⓑ …confidently. Congratulations! You have achieved your goals in this section! Reflect on the study skills you used so that you can continue to use them. What did you do to become confident of your ability to do these things? Be specific! …with some help. This must be addressed quickly as topics you do not master become potholes in your road to success. Math is sequential—every topic builds upon previous work. It is important to make sure you have a strong foundation before you move on. Whom can you ask for help? Your fellow classmates and instructor are good resources. Is there a place on campus where math tutors are available? Can your study skills be improved? …no - I don’t get it! This is critical and you must not ignore it. You need to get help immediately or you will quickly be overwhelmed. See your instructor as soon as possible to discuss your situation. Together you can come up with a plan to get you the help you need."

You have achieved your goals in this section! Reflect on the study skills you used so that you can continue to use them. What did you do to become confident of your ability to do these things? Be specific! …with some help. This must be addressed quickly as topics you do not master become potholes in your road to success. Math is sequential—every topic builds upon previous work. It is important to make sure you have a strong foundation before you move on. Whom can you ask for help? Your fellow classmates and instructor are good resources. Is there a place on campus where math tutors are available? Can your study skills be improved? …no - I don’t get it! This is critical and you must not ignore it.

Page 76,"You have already learned how to multiply binomials using FOIL. Now you’ll need to “undo” this multiplication—to start with the product and end up with the factors. Let’s look at an example of multiplying binomials to refresh your memory. To factor the trinomial means to start with the product, x2+5x+6x2+5x+6, and end with the factors, (x+2)(x+3)(x+2)(x+3). You need to think about where each of the terms in the trinomial came from. x2+5x+6x2+5x+6 (x+2)(x+3)(x+2)(x+3) The first term came from multiplying the first term in each binomial. So to get x2x2 in the product, each binomial must start with an x. x2x2 The last term in the trinomial came from multiplying the last term in each binomial. So the last terms must multiply to 6. What two numbers multiply to 6? The factors of 6 could be 1 and 6, or 2 and 3. How do you know which pair to use? Consider the middle term. It came from adding the outer and inner terms. So the numbers that must have a product of 6 will need a sum of 5. We’ll test both possibilities and summarize the results in Table 7.1—the table will be very helpful when you work with numbers that can be factored in many different ways. Table 7.1 We see that 2 and 3 are the numbers that multiply to 6 and add to 5. So we have the factors of x2+5x+6x2+5x+6. They are (x+2)(x+3)(x+2)(x+3). x2+5x+6x2+5x+6 (x+2)(x+3)(x+2)(x+3) You should check this by multiplying. Looking back, we started with x2+5x+6x2+5x+6, which is of the form x2+bx+cx2+bx+c, where b=5b=5 and c=6c=6. We factored it into two binomials of the form (x+m)and(x+n)(x+m)and(x+n). x2+5x+6x2+5x+6 x2+bx+cx2+bx+c b=5b=5 c=6c=6 (x+m)and(x+n)(x+m)and(x+n) To get the correct factors, we found two numbers m and n whose product is c and sum is b. Example 7.17 Factor: x2+7x+12x2+7x+12. x2+7x+12x2+7x+12 Solution Try It 7.33 Factor: x2+6x+8x2+6x+8. x2+6x+8x2+6x+8 Try It 7.34 Factor: y2+8y+15y2+8y+15. y2+8y+15y2+8y+15 Let’s summarize the steps we used to find the factors. How To Factor trinomials of the form x2+bx+cx2+bx+c. Step 1. Write the factors as two binomials with first terms x: (x)(x)(x)(x). Step 2. Find two numbers m and n that
 Multiply to c, m·n=cm·n=c
 Add to b, m+n=bm+n=b Step 3. Use m and n as the last terms of the factors: (x+m)(x+n)(x+m)(x+n). Step 4. Check by multiplying the factors. Example 7.18 Factor: u2+11u+24u2+11u+24. u2+11u+24u2+11u+24 Solution Notice that the variable is u, so the factors will have first terms u. u

What happens when there are negative terms? Well, it depends which term is negative. Let’s look first at trinomials with only the middle term negative. Remember: To get a negative sum and a positive product, the numbers must both be negative. Again, think about FOIL and where each term in the trinomial came from. Just as before, How do you get a positive product and a negative sum? With two negative numbers. Example 7.20 Factor: t2−11t+28t2−11t+28. t2−11t+28t2−11t+28 Solution Again, with the positive last term, 28, and the negative middle term, −11t−11t, we need two negative factors.

The last term is the product of the last terms in the two binomials. A negative product results from multiplying two numbers with opposite signs. You have to be very careful to choose factors to make sure you get the correct sign for the middle term, too. Remember: To get a negative product, the numbers must have different signs. Example 7.21 Factor: z2+4z−5z2+4z−5. z2+4z−5z2+4z−5 Solution To get a negative last term, multiply one positive and one negative. We need factors of −5−5 that add to positive 4. −5−5 Notice: We listed both 1,−5and−1,51,−5and−1,5 to make sure we got the sign of the middle term correct. 1,−5and−1,51,−5and−1,5 Try It 7.41 Factor: h2+4h−12h2+4h−12. h2+4h−12h2+4h−12 Try It 7.42 Factor: k2+k−20k2+k−20. k2+k−20k2+k−20 Let’s make a minor change to the last trinomial and see what effect it has on the factors. Example 7.22 Factor: z2−4z−5z2−4z−5. z2−4z−5z2−4z−5 Solution This time, we need factors of −5−5 that add to −4−4. −5−5 −4−4 Notice that the factors of z2−4z−5z2−4z−5 are very similar to the factors of z2+4z−5z2+4z−5. It is very important to make sure you choose the factor pair that results in the correct sign of the middle term. z2−4z−5z2−4z−5 z2+4z−5z2+4z−5 Try It 7.43 Factor: x2−4x−12x2−4x−12. x2−4x−12x2−4x−12 Try It 7.44 Factor: y2−y−20y2−y−20. y2−y−20y2−y−20 Example 7.23 Factor: q2−2q−15q2−2q−15. q2−2q−15q2−2q−15 Solution q

When we factor a trinomial, we look at the signs of its terms first to determine the signs of the binomial factors. When c is positive, m and n have the same sign. When c is negative, m and n have opposite signs. Notice that, in the case when m and n have opposite signs, the sign of the one with the larger absolute value matches the sign of b."
Page 76,Solution
Page 76,"In the examples so far, all terms in the trinomial were positive. What happens when there are negative terms? Well, it depends which term is negative. Let’s look first at trinomials with only the middle term negative. Remember: To get a negative sum and a positive product, the numbers must both be negative. Again, think about FOIL and where each term in the trinomial came from. Just as before, How do you get a positive product and a negative sum? With two negative numbers. Example 7.20 Factor: t2−11t+28t2−11t+28. t2−11t+28t2−11t+28 Solution Again, with the positive last term, 28, and the negative middle term, −11t−11t, we need two negative factors. Find two numbers that multiply 28 and add to −11−11. −11t−11t −11−11 t

Page 76,"Now, what if the last term in the trinomial is negative? Think about FOIL. The last term is the product of the last terms in the two binomials. A negative product results from multiplying two numbers with opposite signs. You have to be very careful to choose factors to make sure you get the correct sign for the middle term, too. Remember: To get a negative product, the numbers must have different signs. Example 7.21 Factor: z2+4z−5z2+4z−5. z2+4z−5z2+4z−5 Solution To get a negative last term, multiply one positive and one negative. We need factors of −5−5 that add to positive 4. −5−5 Notice: We listed both 1,−5and−1,51,−5and−1,5 to make sure we got the sign of the middle term correct. 1,−5and−1,51,−5and−1,5 Try It 7.41 Factor: h2+4h−12h2+4h−12. h2+4h−12h2+4h−12 Try It 7.42 Factor: k2+k−20k2+k−20. k2+k−20k2+k−20 Let’s make a minor change to the last trinomial and see what effect it has on the factors. Example 7.22 Factor: z2−4z−5z2−4z−5. z2−4z−5z2−4z−5 Solution This time, we need factors of −5−5 that add to −4−4. −5−5 −4−4 Notice that the factors of z2−4z−5z2−4z−5 are very similar to the factors of z2+4z−5z2+4z−5.

When we factor a trinomial, we look at the signs of its terms first to determine the signs of the binomial factors. When c is positive, m and n have the same sign.

Page 76,"Sometimes you’ll need to factor trinomials of the form x2+bxy+cy2x2+bxy+cy2 with two variables, such as x2+12xy+36y2.x2+12xy+36y2. The first term, x2x2, is the product of the first terms of the binomial factors, x·xx·x. The y2y2 in the last term means that the second terms of the binomial factors must each contain y. To get the coefficients b and c, you use the same process summarized in the previous objective. x2+bxy+cy2x2+bxy+cy2 x2+12xy+36y2.x2+12xy+36y2. x2x2 x·xx·x y2y2 Example 7.26 Factor: x2+12xy+36y2x2+12xy+36y2. x2+12xy+36y2x2+12xy+36y2 Solution Find the numbers that multiply to 36 and add to 12.

2 . Consecutive integers Deirdre is thinking of two consecutive integers whose product is 56. The trinomial x2+x−56x2+x−56 describes how these numbers are related. Factor the trinomial. x2+x−56x2+x−56 130 . Consecutive integers Deshawn is thinking of two consecutive integers whose product is 182. The trinomial x2+x−182x2+x−182 describes how these numbers are related. Factor the trinomial. x2+x−182x2+x−182 . Many trinomials of the form x2+bx+cx2+bx+c factor into the product of two binomials (x+m)(x+n)(x+m)(x+n). Explain how you find the values of m and n. x2+bx+cx2+bx+c (x+m)(x+n)(x+m)(x+n) 132 . How do you determine whether to use plus or minus signs in the binomial factors of a trinomial of the form x2+bx+cx2+bx+c where bb and cc may be positive or negative numbers? x2+bx+cx2+bx+c bb cc . Will factored x2−x−20x2−x−20 as (x+5)(x−4)(x+5)(x−4). Bill factored it as (x+4)(x−5)(x+4)(x−5). Phil factored it as (x−5)(x−4)(x−5)(x−4). Who is correct? Explain why the other two are wrong. x2−x−20x2−x−20 (x+5)(x−4)(x+5)(x−4) (x+4)(x−5)(x+4)(x−5) (x−5)(x−4)(x−5)(x−4) 134 . Look at Example 7.19, where we factored y2+17y+60y2+17y+60. We made a table listing all pairs of factors of 60 and their sums. Do you find this kind of table helpful? Why or why not? y2+17y+60y2+17y+60 ⓐ After completing the exercises, use this checklist to evaluate your mastery of the objectives of this section. ⓐ ⓑ After reviewing this checklist, what will you do to become confident for all goals? ⓑ"

Page 76,. Consecutive integers Deirdre is thinking of two consecutive integers whose product is 56. The trinomial x2+x−56x2+x−56 describes how these numbers are related. Factor the trinomial. x2+x−56x2+x−56 130 . Consecutive integers Deshawn is thinking of two consecutive integers whose product is 182. The trinomial x2+x−182x2+x−182 describes how these numbers are related. Factor the trinomial. x2+x−182x2+x−182
Page 76,". Many trinomials of the form x2+bx+cx2+bx+c factor into the product of two binomials (x+m)(x+n)(x+m)(x+n). Explain how you find the values of m and n. x2+bx+cx2+bx+c (x+m)(x+n)(x+m)(x+n) 132 . How do you determine whether to use plus or minus signs in the binomial factors of a trinomial of the form x2+bx+cx2+bx+c where bb and cc may be positive or negative numbers? x2+bx+cx2+bx+c bb cc . Will factored x2−x−20x2−x−20 as (x+5)(x−4)(x+5)(x−4). Bill factored it as (x+4)(x−5)(x+4)(x−5). Phil factored it as (x−5)(x−4)(x−5)(x−4). Who is correct? Explain why the other two are wrong. x2−x−20x2−x−20 (x+5)(x−4)(x+5)(x−4) (x+4)(x−5)(x+4)(x−5) (x−5)(x−4)(x−5)(x−4) 134 . Look at Example 7.19, where we factored y2+17y+60y2+17y+60. We made a table listing all pairs of factors of 60 and their sums. Do you find this kind of table helpful? Why or why not? y2+17y+60y2+17y+60"

Page 77,"Let’s summarize where we are so far with factoring polynomials. In the first two sections of this chapter, we used three methods of factoring: factoring the GCF, factoring by grouping, and factoring a trinomial by “undoing” FOIL. More methods will follow as you continue in this chapter, as well as later in your studies of algebra. How will you know when to use each factoring method? As you learn more methods of factoring, how will you know when to apply each method and not get them confused? It will help to organize the factoring methods into a strategy that can guide you to use the correct method. As you start to factor a polynomial, always ask first, “Is there a greatest common factor?” If there is, factor it first. The next thing to consider is the type of polynomial. How many terms does it have? Is it a binomial? A trinomial? Or does it have more than three terms? If it is a trinomial where the leading coefficient is one, x2+bx+cx2+bx+c, use the “undo FOIL” method. x2+bx+cx2+bx+c If it has more than three terms, try the grouping method. This is the only method to use for polynomials of more than three terms. Some polynomials cannot be factored. They are called “prime.” Below we summarize the methods we have so far. These are detailed in Choose a strategy to factor polynomials completely. How To Choose a strategy to factor polynomials completely. Step 1. Step 2. Step 3. Check by multiplying the factors. Use the preliminary strategy to completely factor a polynomial. A polynomial is factored completely if, other than monomials, all of its factors are prime. Example 7.29 Identify the best method to use to factor each polynomial. ⓐ ⓑ ⓒ Solution ⓐ ⓐ ⓑ ⓑ ⓒ ⓒ Try It 7.57 Identify the best method to use to factor each polynomial: ⓐ ⓑ ⓒ Try It 7.58 Identify the best method to use to factor each polynomial: ⓐ ⓑ ⓒ"

Page 77,"Now that we have organized what we’ve covered so far, we are ready to factor trinomials whose leading coefficient is not 1, trinomials of the form ax2+bx+cax2+bx+c. ax2+bx+cax2+bx+c Remember to always check for a GCF first! Sometimes, after you factor the GCF, the leading coefficient of the trinomial becomes 1 and you can factor it by the methods in the last section. Let’s do a few examples to see how this works. Watch out for the signs in the next two examples. Example 7.30 Factor completely: 2n2−8n−422n2−8n−42. 2n2−8n−422n2−8n−42 Solution Use the preliminary strategy. Inside the parentheses, is it a binomial, trinomial, or are there more than three terms? Check. 2

Page 77,"What happens when the leading coefficient is not 1 and there is no GCF? There are several methods that can be used to factor these trinomials. First we will use the Trial and Error method. Let’s factor the trinomial 3x2+5x+23x2+5x+2. 3x2+5x+23x2+5x+2 From our earlier work we expect this will factor into two binomials. We know the first terms of the binomial factors will multiply to give us 3x23x2. The only factors of 3x23x2 are 1x,3x1x,3x. We can place them in the binomials. 3x23x2 3x23x2 1x,3x1x,3x Check. Does 1x·3x=3x21x·3x=3x2? 1x·3x=3x21x·3x=3x2 We know the last terms of the binomials will multiply to 2. Since this trinomial has all positive terms, we only need to consider positive factors. The only factors of 2 are 1 and 2. But we now have two cases to consider as it will make a difference if we write 1, 2, or 2, 1. Which factors are correct? To decide that, we multiply the inner and outer terms. Since the middle term of the trinomial is 5x, the factors in the first case will work. Let’s FOIL to check. Our result of the factoring is: Example 7.33 Factor completely: 3y2+22y+73y2+22y+7. 3y2+22y+73y2+22y+7 Solution Try It 7.65 Factor completely: 2a2+5a+32a2+5a+3. 2a2+5a+32a2+5a+3 Try It 7.66 Factor completely: 4b2+5b+14b2+5b+1. 4b2+5b+14b2+5b+1 How To Factor trinomials of the form ax2+bx+cax2+bx+c using trial and error. Step 1. Write the trinomial in descending order of degrees. Step 2. Find all the factor pairs of the first term. Step 3. Find all the factor pairs of the third term. Step 4. Test all the possible combinations of the factors until the correct product is found. Step 5. Check by multiplying. When the middle term is negative and the last term is positive, the signs in the binomials must both be negative. Example 7.34 Factor completely: 6b2−13b+56b2−13b+5. 6b2−13b+56b2−13b+5 Solution Consider all the combinations of factors. Try It 7.67 Factor completely: 8x2−14x+38x2−14x+3. 8x2−14x+38x2−14x+3 Try It 7.68 Factor completely: 10y2−37y+710y2−37y+7. 10y2−37y+710y2−37y+7 When we factor an expression, we always look for a greatest common factor first. If the expression does not have a greatest common factor, there cannot be one in its factors either. This may help us eliminate some of the possible factor combinations. Example 7.35 Factor completely: 14x2−47x−714x2−47x−7. 14x2−47x−714x2−47x−7 Solution Consider all the combinations of factors. We use each pair of the factors of 14x214x2 with each pair of factors of −7.−7. 14x214x2 −7.−7. These pairings lead to the following eight combinations. Try It 7.69 Factor completely: 8a2−3a−58a2−3a−5. 8a2−3a−58a2−3a−5 Try It 7.70 Factor completely: 6b2−b−156b2−b−15. 6b2−b−156b2−b−15 Example 7.36 Factor completely: 18n2−37n+1518n2−37n+15. 18n2−37n+1518n2−37n+15 Solution Consider all the combinations of factors.

Page 77,"Another way to factor trinomials of the form ax2+bx+cax2+bx+c is the “ac” method. (The “ac” method is sometimes called the grouping method.) The “ac” method is actually an extension of the methods you used in the last section to factor trinomials with leading coefficient one. This method is very structured (that is step-by-step), and it always works! ax2+bx+cax2+bx+c Example 7.38 Factor: 6x2+7x+26x2+7x+2. 6x2+7x+26x2+7x+2 Solution Try It 7.75 Factor: 6x2+13x+26x2+13x+2. 6x2+13x+26x2+13x+2 Try It 7.76 Factor: 4y2+8y+34y2+8y+3. 4y2+8y+34y2+8y+3 How To Factor trinomials of the form using the “ac” method. Step 1. Factor any GCF. Step 2. Find the product ac. Step 3. Find two numbers m and n that:
Multiply toacm·n=a·cAdd tobm+n=bMultiply toacm·n=a·cAdd tobm+n=b Step 4. Split the middle term using m and n: Step 5. Factor by grouping. Step 6. Check by multiplying the factors. When the third term of the trinomial is negative, the factors of the third term will have opposite signs. Example 7.39 Factor: 8u2−17u−218u2−17u−21. 8u2−17u−218u2−17u−21 Solution Find two numbers that multiply to −168−168 and add to −17−17.

Height of a toy rocket The height of a toy rocket launched with an initial speed of 80 feet per second from the balcony of an apartment building is related to the number of seconds, t, since it is launched by the trinomial −16t2+80t+96−16t2+80t+96. Completely factor the trinomial. −16t2+80t+96−16t2+80t+96 210 . Height of a beach ball The height of a beach ball tossed up with an initial speed of 12 feet per second from a height of 4 feet is related to the number of seconds, t, since it is tossed by the trinomial −16t2+12t+4−16t2+12t+4. Completely factor the trinomial. −16t2+12t+4−16t2+12t+4 . List, in order, all the steps you take when using the “ac” method to factor a trinomial of the form ax2+bx+c.ax2+bx+c. ax2+bx+c.ax2+bx+c. 212 . How is the “ac” method similar to the “undo FOIL” method? How is it different? . What are the questions, in order, that you ask yourself as you start to factor a polynomial? What do you need to do as a result of the answer to each question? 214 . On your paper draw the chart that summarizes the factoring strategy. Try to do it without looking at the book. When you are done, look back at the book to finish it or verify it. ⓐ After completing the exercises, use this checklist to evaluate your mastery of the objectives of this section. ⓐ ⓑ What does this checklist tell you about your mastery of this section?

Page 78,"Some trinomials are perfect squares. They result from multiplying a binomial times itself. You can square a binomial by using FOIL, but using the Binomial Squares pattern you saw in a previous chapter saves you a step. Let’s review the Binomial Squares pattern by squaring a binomial using FOIL. The first term is the square of the first term of the binomial and the last term is the square of the last. The middle term is twice the product of the two terms of the binomial. The trinomial 9x2 + 24 +16 is called a perfect square trinomial. It is the square of the binomial 3x+4. We’ll repeat the Binomial Squares Pattern here to use as a reference in factoring. Binomial Squares Pattern If a and b are real numbers, When you square a binomial, the product is a perfect square trinomial. In this chapter, you are learning to factor—now, you will start with a perfect square trinomial and factor it into its prime factors. You could factor this trinomial using the methods described in the last section, since it is of the form ax2 + bx + c. But if you recognize that the first and last terms are squares and the trinomial fits the perfect square trinomials pattern, you will save yourself a lot of work. perfect square trinomials pattern Here is the pattern—the reverse of the binomial squares pattern. Perfect Square Trinomials Pattern If a and b are real numbers, To make use of this pattern, you have to recognize that a given trinomial fits it. Check first to see if the leading coefficient is a perfect square, a2a2. Next check that the last term is a perfect square, b2b2. Then check the middle term—is it twice the product, 2ab? If everything checks, you can easily write the factors. a2a2 b2b2 Example 7.42 Factor: 9x2+12x+49x2+12x+4. 9x2+12x+49x2+12x+4 Solution Try It 7.83 Factor: 4x2+12x+94x2+12x+9. 4x2+12x+94x2+12x+9 Try It 7.84 Factor: 9y2+24y+169y2+24y+16. 9y2+24y+169y2+24y+16 The sign of the middle term determines which pattern we will use. When the middle term is negative, we use the pattern a2−2ab+b2a2−2ab+b2, which factors to (a−b)2(a−b)2. a2−2ab+b2a2−2ab+b2 (a−b)2(a−b)2 The steps are summarized here.

Example 7.43 Factor: 81y2−72y+1681y2−72y+16. 81y2−72y+1681y2−72y+16 Solution The first and last terms are squares. See if the middle term fits the pattern of a perfect square trinomial. The middle term is negative, so the binomial square would be (a−b)2(a−b)2.

It was to ask “is there a greatest common factor?” and, if there was, you factor the GCF before going any further. Perfect square trinomials may have a GCF in all three terms and it should be factored out first. And, sometimes, once the GCF has been factored, you will recognize a perfect square trinomial. Example 7.46 Factor: 36x2y−48xy+16y36x2y−48xy+16y. 36x2y−48xy+16y36x2y−48xy+16y Solution Try It 7.91 Factor: 8x2y−24xy+18y8x2y−24xy+18y. 8x2y−24xy+18y8x2y−24xy+18y Try It 7.92 Factor: 27p2q+90pq+75q27p2q+90pq+75q. 27p2q+90pq+75q27p2q+90pq+75q"

Page 78,"The other special product you saw in the previous chapter was the Product of Conjugates pattern. You used this to multiply two binomials that were conjugates. Here’s an example: Remember, when you multiply conjugate binomials, the middle terms of the product add to 0. All you have left is a binomial, the difference of squares. Multiplying conjugates is the only way to get a binomial from the product of two binomials. Product of Conjugates Pattern If a and b are real numbers The product is called a difference of squares. To factor, we will use the product pattern “in reverse” to factor the difference of squares. A difference of squares factors to a product of conjugates. difference of squares Difference of Squares Pattern If a and b are real numbers, Remember, “difference” refers to subtraction. So, to use this pattern you must make sure you have a binomial in which two squares are being subtracted. Example 7.47 Factor: x2−4x2−4. x2−4x2−4 Solution Try It 7.93 Factor: h2−81h2−81. h2−81h2−81 Try It 7.94 Factor: k2−121k2−121. k2−121k2−121 How To Factor differences of squares.

It is important to remember that sums of squares do not factor into a product of binomials. There are no binomial factors that multiply together to get a sum of squares. After removing any GCF, the expression a2+b2a2+b2 is prime! a2+b2a2+b2 Don’t forget that 1 is a perfect square. We’ll need to use that fact in the next example.

✓ Try It 7.97 Factor: 196m2−25n2196m2−25n2. 196m2−25n2196m2−25n2 Try It 7.98 Factor: 144p2−9q2144p2−9q2. 144p2−9q2144p2−9q2 The binomial in the next example may look “backwards,” but it’s still the difference of squares. Example 7.50 Factor: 100−h2100−h2. 100−h2100−h2 Solution Factor h2−100h2−100 on your own and then notice how the result differs from (10−h)(10+h)(10−h)(10+h). h2−100h2−100 (10−h)(10+h)(10−h)(10+h) Try It 7.99 Factor: 144−x2144−x2. 144−x2144−x2 Try It 7.100 Factor: 169−p2169−p2. 169−p2169−p2 To completely factor the binomial in the next example, we’ll factor a difference of squares twice! Example 7.51 Factor: x4−y4x4−y4. x4−y4x4−y4 Solution Try It 7.101 Factor: a4−b4a4−b4. a4−b4a4−b4 Try It 7.102 Factor: x4−16x4−16. x4−16x4−16 As always, you should look for a common factor first whenever you have an expression to factor. Sometimes a common factor may “disguise” the difference of squares and you won’t recognize the perfect squares until you factor the GCF. Example 7.52 Factor: 8x2y−98y8x2y−98y. 8x2y−98y8x2y−98y Solution Try It 7.103 Factor: 7xy2−175x7xy2−175x. 7xy2−175x7xy2−175x Try It 7.104 Factor: 45a2b−80b45a2b−80b. 45a2b−80b45a2b−80b Example 7.53 Factor: 6x2+966x2+96. 6x2+966x2+96 Solution Try It 7.105 Factor: 8a2+2008a2+200. 8a2+2008a2+200 Try It 7.106 Factor: 36y2+8136y2+81. 36y2+8136y2+81"
Page 78,"There is another special pattern for factoring, one that we did not use when we multiplied polynomials. This is the pattern for the sum and difference of cubes. We will write these formulas first and then check them by multiplication. We’ll check the first pattern and leave the second to you. Sum and Difference of Cubes Pattern The two patterns look very similar, don’t they? But notice the signs in the factors. The sign of the binomial factor matches the sign in the original binomial. And the sign of the middle term of the trinomial factor is the opposite of the sign in the original binomial. If you recognize the pattern of the signs, it may help you memorize the patterns. The trinomial factor in the sum and difference of cubes pattern cannot be factored. sum and difference of cubes pattern It can be very helpful if you learn to recognize the cubes of the integers from 1 to 10, just like you have learned to recognize squares. We have listed the cubes of the integers from 1 to 10 in Table 7.2. Table 7.2 Example 7.54 Factor: x3+64x3+64. x3+64x3+64 Solution Try It 7.107 Factor: x3+27x3+27. x3+27x3+27 Try It 7.108 Factor: y3+8y3+8. y3+8y3+8 How To Factor the sum or difference of cubes. To factor the sum or difference of cubes: Step 1. Step 2. Write them as cubes. Step 3. Use either the sum or difference of cubes pattern. Step 4. Simplify inside the parentheses Step 5. Check by multiplying the factors. Example 7.55 Factor: x3−1000x3−1000. x3−1000x3−1000 Solution Try It 7.109 Factor: u3−125u3−125. u3−125u3−125 Try It 7.110 Factor: v3−343v3−343. v3−343v3−343 Be careful to use the correct signs in the factors of the sum and difference of cubes. Example 7.56 Factor: 512−125p3512−125p3. 512−125p3512−125p3 Solution Try It 7.111 Factor: 64−27x364−27x3. 64−27x364−27x3 Try It 7.112 Factor: 27−8y327−8y3. 27−8y327−8y3 Example 7.57 Factor: 27u3−125v327u3−125v3. 27u3−125v327u3−125v3 Solution Try It 7.113 Factor: 8x3−27y38x3−27y3. 8x3−27y38x3−27y3 Try It 7.114 Factor: 1000m3−125n31000m3−125n3. 1000m3−125n31000m3−125n3 In the next example, we first factor out the GCF. Then we can recognize the sum of cubes. Example 7.58 Factor: 5m3+40n35m3+40n3. 5m3+40n35m3+40n3 Solution Check. To check, you may find it easier to multiply the sum of cubes factors first, then multiply that product by 5. We’ll leave the multiplication for you. 5

Pumpkin drop A fall tradition at the University of California San Diego is the Pumpkin Drop, where a pumpkin is dropped from the eleventh story of Tioga Hall. ⓐ ⓑ . The difference of squares y4−625y4−625 can be factored as (y2−25)(y2+25)(y2−25)(y2+25). But it is not completely factored. What more must be done to completely factor it? y4−625y4−625 (y2−25)(y2+25)(y2−25)(y2+25) 314 . Of all the factoring methods covered in this chapter (GCF, grouping, undo FOIL, ‘ac’ method, special products) which is the easiest for you? Which is the hardest? Explain your answers. ⓐ After completing the exercises, use this checklist to evaluate your mastery of the objectives of this section. ⓐ ⓑ Overall, after looking at the checklist, do you think you are well-prepared for the next section?

Page 80,"We will first solve some quadratic equations by using the Zero Product Property. The Zero Product Property says that if the product of two quantities is zero, it must be that at least one of the quantities is zero. The only way to get a product equal to zero is to multiply by zero itself. Zero Product Property Zero Product Property If a·b=0a·b=0, then either a=0a=0 or b=0b=0 or both. a·b=0a·b=0 a=0a=0 b=0b=0 We will now use the Zero Product Property, to solve a quadratic equation. Zero Product Property Example 7.69 Solve: (x+1)(x−4)=0(x+1)(x−4)=0. (x+1)(x−4)=0(x+1)(x−4)=0 Solution Try It 7.137 Solve: (x−3)(x+5)=0(x−3)(x+5)=0. (x−3)(x+5)=0(x−3)(x+5)=0 Try It 7.138 Solve: (y−6)(y+9)=0(y−6)(y+9)=0. (y−6)(y+9)=0(y−6)(y+9)=0 We usually will do a little more work than we did in this last example to solve the linear equations that result from using the Zero Product Property. Example 7.70 Solve: (5n−2)(6n−1)=0(5n−2)(6n−1)=0. (5n−2)(6n−1)=0(5n−2)(6n−1)=0 Solution Try It 7.139 Solve: (3m−2)(2m+1)=0(3m−2)(2m+1)=0. (3m−2)(2m+1)=0(3m−2)(2m+1)=0 Try It 7.140 Solve: (4p+3)(4p−3)=0(4p+3)(4p−3)=0. (4p+3)(4p−3)=0(4p+3)(4p−3)=0 Notice when we checked the solutions that each of them made just one factor equal to zero. But the product was zero for both solutions. Example 7.71 Solve: 3p(10p+7)=03p(10p+7)=0. 3p(10p+7)=03p(10p+7)=0 Solution Try It 7.141 Solve: 2u(5u−1)=02u(5u−1)=0. 2u(5u−1)=02u(5u−1)=0 Try It 7.142 Solve: w(2w+3)=0w(2w+3)=0. w(2w+3)=0w(2w+3)=0 It may appear that there is only one factor in the next example. Remember, however, that (y−8)2(y−8)2 means (y−8)(y−8)(y−8)(y−8). (y−8)2(y−8)2 (y−8)(y−8)(y−8)(y−8) Example 7.72 Solve: (y−8)2=0(y−8)2=0. (y−8)2=0(y−8)2=0 Solution Try It 7.143 Solve: (x+1)2=0(x+1)2=0. (x+1)2=0(x+1)2=0 Try It 7.144 Solve: (v−2)2=0(v−2)2=0. (v−2)2=0(v−2)2=0"

Page 80,"Each of the equations we have solved in this section so far had one side in factored form. In order to use the Zero Product Property, the quadratic equation must be factored, with zero on one side. So we must be sure to start with the quadratic equation in standard form, ax2+bx+c=0ax2+bx+c=0. Then we can factor the expression on the left. ax2+bx+c=0ax2+bx+c=0 Example 7.73 Solve: x2+2x−8=0x2+2x−8=0. x2+2x−8=0x2+2x−8=0 Solution Try It 7.145 Solve: x2−x−12=0x2−x−12=0. x2−x−12=0x2−x−12=0 Try It 7.146 Solve: b2+9b+14=0b2+9b+14=0. b2+9b+14=0b2+9b+14=0 How To Solve a quadratic equation by factoring. Step 1. Write the quadratic equation in standard form, ax2+bx+c=0ax2+bx+c=0. Step 2. Factor the quadratic expression. Step 3. Use the Zero Product Property. Step 4. Solve the linear equations. Step 5. Check. Before we factor, we must make sure the quadratic equation is in standard form. Example 7.74 Solve: 2y2=13y+452y2=13y+45. 2y2=13y+452y2=13y+45 Solution Try It 7.147 Solve: 3c2=10c−83c2=10c−8. 3c2=10c−83c2=10c−8 Try It 7.148 Solve: 2d2−5d=32d2−5d=3. 2d2−5d=32d2−5d=3 Example 7.75 Solve: 5x2−13x=7x5x2−13x=7x. 5x2−13x=7x5x2−13x=7x Solution Try It 7.149 Solve: 6a2+9a=3a6a2+9a=3a. 6a2+9a=3a6a2+9a=3a Try It 7.150 Solve: 45b2−2b=−17b45b2−2b=−17b. 45b2−2b=−17b45b2−2b=−17b Solving quadratic equations by factoring will make use of all the factoring techniques you have learned in this chapter! Do you recognize the special product pattern in the next example? Example 7.76 Solve: 144q2=25144q2=25. 144q2=25144q2=25 Solution Try It 7.151 Solve: 25p2=4925p2=49. 25p2=4925p2=49 Try It 7.152 Solve: 36x2=12136x2=121. 36x2=12136x2=121 The left side in the next example is factored, but the right side is not zero. In order to use the Zero Product Property, one side of the equation must be zero. We’ll multiply the factors and then write the equation in standard form. Example 7.77 Solve: (3x−8)(x−1)=3x(3x−8)(x−1)=3x. (3x−8)(x−1)=3x(3x−8)(x−1)=3x Solution Try It 7.153 Solve: (2m+1)(m+3)=12m(2m+1)(m+3)=12m. (2m+1)(m+3)=12m(2m+1)(m+3)=12m Try It 7.154 Solve: (k+1)(k−1)=8(k+1)(k−1)=8. (k+1)(k−1)=8(k+1)(k−1)=8 The Zero Product Property also applies to the product of three or more factors. If the product is zero, at least one of the factors must be zero. We can solve some equations of degree more than two by using the Zero Product Property, just like we solved quadratic equations. Example 7.78 Solve: 9m3+100m=60m29m3+100m=60m2. 9m3+100m=60m29m3+100m=60m2 Solution Try It 7.155 Solve: 8x3=24x2−18x8x3=24x2−18x. 8x3=24x2−18x8x3=24x2−18x Try It 7.156 Solve: 16y2=32y3+2y16y2=32y3+2y. 16y2=32y3+2y16y2=32y3+2y When we factor the quadratic equation in the next example we will get three factors. However the first factor is a constant. We know that factor cannot equal 0. Example 7.79 Solve: 4x2=16x+844x2=16x+84. 4x2=16x+844x2=16x+84 Solution Try It 7.157 Solve: 18a2−30=−33a18a2−30=−33a. 18a2−30=−33a18a2−30=−33a Try It 7.158 Solve: 123b=−6−60b2123b=−6−60b2. 123b=−6−60b2123b=−6−60b2"
Page 80,"The problem solving strategy we used earlier for applications that translate to linear equations will work just as well for applications that translate to quadratic equations. We will copy the problem solving strategy here so we can use it for reference. How To Use a problem-solving strategy to solve word problems. Step 1. Read the problem. Make sure all the words and ideas are understood. Step 2. Identify what we are looking for. Step 3. Name what we are looking for. Choose a variable to represent that quantity. Step 4. Translate into an equation. It may be helpful to restate the problem in one sentence with all the important information. Then, translate the English sentence into an algebra equation. Step 5. Solve the equation using good algebra techniques. Step 6. Check the answer in the problem and make sure it makes sense. Step 7. Answer the question with a complete sentence. We will start with a number problem to get practice translating words into a quadratic equation. Example 7.80 The product of two consecutive integers is 132. Find the integers. Solution Try It 7.159 The product of two consecutive integers is 240240. Find the integers. 240240 Try It 7.160 The product of two consecutive integers is 420420. Find the integers. 420420 Were you surprised by the pair of negative integers that is one of the solutions to the previous example? The product of the two positive integers and the product of the two negative integers both give 132. In some applications, negative solutions will result from the algebra, but will not be realistic for the situation. Example 7.81 A rectangular garden has an area 1515 square feet. The length of the garden is two feet more than the width. Find the length and width of the garden. 1515 Solution Try It 7.161 A rectangular sign has an area of 30 square feet. The length of the sign is one foot more than the width. Find the length and width of the sign. Try It 7.162 A rectangular patio has an area of 180 square feet. The width of the patio is three feet less than the length. Find the length and width of the patio. In an earlier chapter, we used the Pythagorean Theorem (a2+b2=c2)(a2+b2=c2). It gave the relation between the legs and the hypotenuse of a right triangle. (a2+b2=c2)(a2+b2=c2) We will use this formula to in the next example. Example 7.82 Justine wants to put a deck in the corner of her backyard in the shape of a right triangle, as shown below. The hypotenuse will be 17 feet long. The length of one side will be 7 feet less than the length of the other side. Find the lengths of the sides of the deck. Solution Try It 7.163 A boat’s sail is a right triangle. The length of one side of the sail is 7 feet more than the other side. The hypotenuse is 13. Find the lengths of the two sides of the sail. Try It 7.164 A meditation garden is in the shape of a right triangle, with one leg 7 feet. The length of the hypotenuse is one more than the length of one of the other legs. Find the lengths of the hypotenuse and the other leg."

Multiply to c, m·n=cm·n=c
Add to b, m+n=bm+n=b Step 3. Use m and n as the last terms of the factors: (x+m)(x+n)(x+m)(x+n). Step 4. Check by multiplying the factors."
Page 82,"7.3 Factor Trinomials of the Form ax2+bx+c Step 1. Write the trinomial in descending order of degrees. Step 2. Find all the factor pairs of the first term. Step 3. Find all the factor pairs of the third term. Step 4. Test all the possible combinations of the factors until the correct product is found. Step 5. Check by multiplying. Step 1. Factor any GCF. Step 2. Find the product ac. Step 3. Find two numbers m and n that:
Multiply toacm·n=a·cAdd tobm+n=bMultiply toacm·n=a·cAdd tobm+n=b Step 4. Split the middle term using m and n: Step 5. Factor by grouping. Step 6. Check by multiplying the factors. Step 1. Is there a greatest common factor? Factor it. Step 2. Is the polynomial a binomial, trinomial, or are there more than three terms?
If it is a binomial, right now we have no method to factor it.
If it is a trinomial of the form x2+bx+cx2+bx+c
   Undo FOIL (x)(x)(x)(x).
If it is a trinomial of the form ax2+bx+cax2+bx+c
   Use Trial and Error or the “ac” method.
If it has more than three terms
   Use the grouping method. Step 3. Check by multiplying the factors."
Page 82,7.4 Factor Special Products Step 1. Does the binomial fit the sum or difference of cubes pattern? Is it a sum or difference? Are the first and last terms perfect cubes? Step 2. Write them as cubes. Step 3. Use either the sum or difference of cubes pattern. Step 4. Simplify inside the parentheses Step 5. Check by multiplying the factors.

Page 86,"When we work with a numerical fraction, it is easy to avoid dividing by zero, because we can see the number in the denominator. In order to avoid dividing by zero in a rational expression, we must not allow values of the variable that will make the denominator be zero. If the denominator is zero, the rational expression is undefined. The numerator of a rational expression may be 0—but not the denominator. So before we begin any operation with a rational expression, we examine it first to find the values that would make the denominator zero. That way, when we solve a rational equation for example, we will know whether the algebraic solutions we find are allowed or not. How To Determine the Values for Which a Rational Expression is Undefined. Step 1. Set the denominator equal to zero. Step 2. Solve the equation in the set of reals, if possible. Example 8.1 Determine the values for which the rational expression is undefined: ⓐ 9yx9yx ⓑ 4b−32b+54b−32b+5 ⓒ x+4x2+5x+6x+4x2+5x+6 ⓐ 9yx9yx ⓑ 4b−32b+54b−32b+5 ⓒ x+4x2+5x+6x+4x2+5x+6 Solution The expression will be undefined when the denominator is zero. ⓐ ⓐ ⓑ ⓑ ⓒ ⓒ Saying that the rational expression x+4x2+5x+6x+4x2+5x+6 is undefined for x=−2orx=−3x=−2orx=−3 is similar to writing the phrase “void where prohibited” in contest rules. x+4x2+5x+6x+4x2+5x+6 x=−2orx=−3x=−2orx=−3 Try It 8.1 Determine the values for which the rational expression is undefined: ⓐ 3yx3yx ⓑ 8n−53n+18n−53n+1 ⓒ a+10a2+4a+3a+10a2+4a+3 ⓐ 3yx3yx ⓑ 8n−53n+18n−53n+1 ⓒ a+10a2+4a+3a+10a2+4a+3 Try It 8.2 Determine the values for which the rational expression is undefined: ⓐ 4p5q4p5q ⓑ y−13y+2y−13y+2 ⓒ m−5m2+m−6m−5m2+m−6 ⓐ 4p5q4p5q ⓑ y−13y+2y−13y+2 ⓒ m−5m2+m−6m−5m2+m−6"
Page 86,Solution The expression will be undefined when the denominator is zero. ⓐ ⓐ ⓑ ⓑ ⓒ ⓒ Saying that the rational expression x+4x2+5x+6x+4x2+5x+6 is undefined for x=−2orx=−3x=−2orx=−3 is similar to writing the phrase “void where prohibited” in contest rules. x+4x2+5x+6x+4x2+5x+6 x=−2orx=−3x=−2orx=−3
Page 86,"To evaluate a rational expression, we substitute values of the variables into the expression and simplify, just as we have for many other expressions in this book. Example 8.2 Evaluate 2x+33x−52x+33x−5 for each value: 2x+33x−52x+33x−5 ⓐ x=0x=0 ⓑ x=2x=2 ⓒ x=−3x=−3 ⓐ x=0x=0 ⓑ x=2x=2 ⓒ x=−3x=−3 Solution ⓐ ⓐ ⓑ ⓑ ⓒ ⓒ Try It 8.3 Evaluate y+12y−3y+12y−3 for each value: y+12y−3y+12y−3 ⓐ y=1y=1 ⓑ y=−3y=−3 ⓒ y=0y=0 ⓐ y=1y=1 ⓑ y=−3y=−3 ⓒ y=0y=0 Try It 8.4 Evaluate 5x−12x+15x−12x+1 for each value: 5x−12x+15x−12x+1 ⓐ x=1x=1 ⓑ x=−1x=−1 ⓒ x=0x=0 ⓐ x=1x=1 ⓑ x=−1x=−1 ⓒ x=0x=0 Example 8.3 Evaluate x2+8x+7x2−4x2+8x+7x2−4 for each value: x2+8x+7x2−4x2+8x+7x2−4 ⓐ x=0x=0 ⓑ x=2x=2 ⓒ x=−1x=−1 ⓐ x=0x=0 ⓑ x=2x=2 ⓒ x=−1x=−1 Solution ⓐ ⓐ ⓑ ⓑ ⓒ ⓒ Try It 8.5 Evaluate x2+1x2−3x+2x2+1x2−3x+2 for each value: x2+1x2−3x+2x2+1x2−3x+2 ⓐ x=0x=0 ⓑ x=−1x=−1 ⓒ x=3x=3 ⓐ x=0x=0 ⓑ x=−1x=−1 ⓒ x=3x=3 Try It 8.6 Evaluate x2+x−6x2−9x2+x−6x2−9 for each value: x2+x−6x2−9x2+x−6x2−9 ⓐ x=0x=0 ⓑ x=−2x=−2 ⓒ x=1x=1 ⓐ x=0x=0 ⓑ x=−2x=−2 ⓒ x=1x=1 Remember that a fraction is simplified when it has no common factors, other than 1, in its numerator and denominator. When we evaluate a rational expression, we make sure to simplify the resulting fraction. Example 8.4 Evaluate a2+2ab+b23ab2a2+2ab+b23ab2 for each value: a2+2ab+b23ab2a2+2ab+b23ab2 ⓐ a=1,b=2a=1,b=2 ⓑ a=−2,b=−1a=−2,b=−1 ⓒ a=13,b=0a=13,b=0 ⓐ a=1,b=2a=1,b=2 ⓑ a=−2,b=−1a=−2,b=−1 ⓒ a=13,b=0a=13,b=0 Solution ⓐ ⓐ ⓑ ⓑ ⓒ ⓒ Try It 8.7 Evaluate 2a3ba2+2ab+b22a3ba2+2ab+b2 for each value: 2a3ba2+2ab+b22a3ba2+2ab+b2 ⓐ a=−1,b=2a=−1,b=2 ⓑ a=0,b=−1a=0,b=−1 ⓒ a=1,b=12a=1,b=12 ⓐ a=−1,b=2a=−1,b=2 ⓑ a=0,b=−1a=0,b=−1 ⓒ a=1,b=12a=1,b=12 Try It 8.8 Evaluate a2−b28ab3a2−b28ab3 for each value: a2−b28ab3a2−b28ab3 ⓐ a=1,b=−1a=1,b=−1 ⓑ a=12,b=−1a=12,b=−1 ⓒ a=−2,b=1a=−2,b=1 ⓐ a=1,b=−1a=1,b=−1 ⓑ a=12,b=−1a=12,b=−1 ⓒ a=−2,b=1a=−2,b=1"
Page 86,"Just like a fraction is considered simplified if there are no common factors, other than 1, in its numerator and denominator, a rational expression is simplified if it has no common factors, other than 1, in its numerator and denominator. Simplified Rational Expression A rational expression is considered simplified if there are no common factors in its numerator and denominator. For example: We use the Equivalent Fractions Property to simplify numerical fractions. We restate it here as we will also use it to simplify rational expressions. rational expression Equivalent Fractions Property If a, b, and c are numbers where b≠0,c≠0b≠0,c≠0, then ab=a·cb·cab=a·cb·c and a·cb·c=aba·cb·c=ab. b≠0,c≠0b≠0,c≠0 ab=a·cb·cab=a·cb·c a·cb·c=aba·cb·c=ab Notice that in the Equivalent Fractions Property, the values that would make the denominators zero are specifically disallowed. We see b≠0,c≠0b≠0,c≠0 clearly stated. Every time we write a rational expression, we should make a similar statement disallowing values that would make a denominator zero. However, to let us focus on the work at hand, we will omit writing it in the examples. b≠0,c≠0b≠0,c≠0 Let’s start by reviewing how we simplify numerical fractions. Example 8.5 Simplify: −3663.−3663. −3663.−3663. Solution Notice that the fraction −47−47 is simplified because there are no more common factors. −47−47 Try It 8.9 Simplify: −4581.−4581. −4581.−4581. Try It 8.10 Simplify: −4254.−4254. −4254.−4254. Throughout this chapter, we will assume that all numerical values that would make the denominator be zero are excluded. We will not write the restrictions for each rational expression, but keep in mind that the denominator can never be zero. So in this next example, x≠0x≠0 and y≠0y≠0. x≠0x≠0 y≠0y≠0 Example 8.6 Simplify: 3xy18x2y2.3xy18x2y2. 3xy18x2y2.3xy18x2y2. Solution Did you notice that these are the same steps we took when we divided monomials in Polynomials? Try It 8.11 Simplify: 4x2y12xy2.4x2y12xy2. 4x2y12xy2.4x2y12xy2. Try It 8.12 Simplify: 16x2y2xy2.16x2y2xy2. 16x2y2xy2.16x2y2xy2. To simplify rational expressions we first write the numerator and denominator in factored form. Then we remove the common factors using the Equivalent Fractions Property. Be very careful as you remove common factors. Factors are multiplied to make a product. You can remove a factor from a product. You cannot remove a term from a sum. Note that removing the x’s from x+5xx+5x would be like cancelling the 2’s in the fraction 2+522+52! x+5xx+5x 2+522+52 Example 8.7 Simplify: 2x+85x+20.2x+85x+20. 2x+85x+20.2x+85x+20. Solution Try It 8.13 Simplify: 3x−62x−4.3x−62x−4. 3x−62x−4.3x−62x−4. Try It 8.14 Simplify: 7y+355y+25.7y+355y+25. 7y+355y+25.7y+355y+25. We now summarize the steps you should follow to simplify rational expressions. How To Simplify a Rational Expression. Step 1. Factor the numerator and denominator completely. Step 2. Simplify by dividing out common factors. Usually, we leave the simplified rational expression in factored form. This way it is easy to check that we have removed all the common factors! We’ll use the methods we covered in Factoring to factor the polynomials in the numerators and denominators in the following examples. Example 8.8 Simplify: x2+5x+6x2+8x+12.x2+5x+6x2+8x+12. x2+5x+6x2+8x+12.x2+5x+6x2+8x+12. Solution x

Page 86,"Now we will see how to simplify a rational expression whose numerator and denominator have opposite factors. Let’s start with a numerical fraction, say 7−77−7. We know this fraction simplifies to −1−1. We also recognize that the numerator and denominator are opposites. 7−77−7 −1−1 In Foundations, we introduced opposite notation: the opposite of aa is −a−a. We remember, too, that −a=−1·a−a=−1·a. aa −a−a −a=−1·a−a=−1·a We simplify the fraction a−aa−a, whose numerator and denominator are opposites, in this way: a−aa−a a−aWe could rewrite this.1·a−1·aRemove the common factors.1−1Simplify.−1a−aWe could rewrite this.1·a−1·aRemove the common factors.1−1Simplify.−1 a−aWe could rewrite this.1·a−1·aRemove the common factors.1−1Simplify.−1a−aWe could rewrite this.1·a−1·aRemove the common factors.1−1Simplify.−1 So, in the same way, we can simplify the fraction x−3−(x−3)x−3−(x−3): x−3−(x−3)x−3−(x−3) We could rewrite this.1·(x−3)−1·(x−3)Remove the common factors.1−1Simplify.−1We could rewrite this.1·(x−3)−1·(x−3)Remove the common factors.1−1Simplify.−1 We could rewrite this.1·(x−3)−1·(x−3)Remove the common factors.1−1Simplify.−1We could rewrite this.1·(x−3)−1·(x−3)Remove the common factors.1−1Simplify.−1 But the opposite of x−3x−3 could be written differently: x−3x−3 −(x−3)Distribute.−x+3Rewrite.3−x−(x−3)Distribute.−x+3Rewrite.3−x −(x−3)Distribute.−x+3Rewrite.3−x−(x−3)Distribute.−x+3Rewrite.3−x This means the fraction x−33−xx−33−x simplifies to −1−1. x−33−xx−33−x −1−1 In general, we could write the opposite of a−ba−b as b−ab−a. So the rational expression a−bb−aa−bb−a simplifies to −1−1. a−ba−b b−ab−a a−bb−aa−bb−a −1−1 Opposites in a Rational Expression The opposite of a−ba−b is b−ab−a. a−ba−b b−ab−a An expression and its opposite divide to −1−1. −1−1 We will use this property to simplify rational expressions that contain opposites in their numerators and denominators.

2 . Tax Rates For the tax year 2015, the amount of tax owed by a single person earning between $37,450 and $90,750, can be found by evaluating the formula 0.25x−4206.25,0.25x−4206.25, where x is income. The average tax rate for this income can be found by evaluating the formula 0.25x−4206.25x.0.25x−4206.25x. What would be the average tax rate for a single person earning $50,000? 0.25x−4206.25,0.25x−4206.25, 0.25x−4206.25x.0.25x−4206.25x. 70 . Work The length of time it takes for two people for perform the same task if they work together can be found by evaluating the formula xyx+y.xyx+y. If Tom can paint the den in x=x= 45 minutes and his brother Bobby can paint it in y=y= 60 minutes, how many minutes will it take them if they work together? xyx+y.xyx+y. x=x= y=y= . Explain how you find the values of x for which the rational expression x2−x−20x2−4x2−x−20x2−4 is undefined. x2−x−20x2−4x2−x−20x2−4 72 . Explain all the steps you take to simplify the rational expression p2+4p−219−p2.p2+4p−219−p2. p2+4p−219−p2.p2+4p−219−p2. ⓐ After completing the exercises, use this checklist to evaluate your mastery of the objectives of this section. ⓐ ⓑ If most of your checks were: ⓑ …confidently. Congratulations! You have achieved your goals in this section! Reflect on the study skills you used so that you can continue to use them. What did you do to become confident of your ability to do these things? Be specific! …with some help. This must be addressed quickly as topics you do not master become potholes in your road to success. Math is sequential - every topic builds upon previous work. It is important to make sure you have a strong foundation before you move on. Whom can you ask for help? Your fellow classmates and instructor are good resources. Is there a place on campus where math tutors are available? Can your study skills be improved? …no - I don’t get it! This is critical and you must not ignore it. You need to get help immediately or you will quickly be overwhelmed. See your instructor as soon as possible to discuss your situation. Together you can come up with a plan to get you the help you need."

Page 86,". Tax Rates For the tax year 2015, the amount of tax owed by a single person earning between $37,450 and $90,750, can be found by evaluating the formula 0.25x−4206.25,0.25x−4206.25, where x is income. The average tax rate for this income can be found by evaluating the formula 0.25x−4206.25x.0.25x−4206.25x. What would be the average tax rate for a single person earning $50,000? 0.25x−4206.25,0.25x−4206.25, 0.25x−4206.25x.0.25x−4206.25x. 70 . Work The length of time it takes for two people for perform the same task if they work together can be found by evaluating the formula xyx+y.xyx+y.

You have achieved your goals in this section! Reflect on the study skills you used so that you can continue to use them. What did you do to become confident of your ability to do these things? Be specific! …with some help. This must be addressed quickly as topics you do not master become potholes in your road to success. Math is sequential - every topic builds upon previous work. It is important to make sure you have a strong foundation before you move on. Whom can you ask for help? Your fellow classmates and instructor are good resources. Is there a place on campus where math tutors are available? Can your study skills be improved? …no - I don’t get it! This is critical and you must not ignore it. You need to get help immediately or you will quickly be overwhelmed. See your instructor as soon as possible to discuss your situation. Together you can come up with a plan to get you the help you need."

Page 87,"To multiply rational expressions, we do just what we did with numerical fractions. We multiply the numerators and multiply the denominators. Then, if there are any common factors, we remove them to simplify the result. Multiplication of Rational Expressions If p,q,r,sp,q,r,s are polynomials where q≠0ands≠0q≠0ands≠0, then p,q,r,sp,q,r,s q≠0ands≠0q≠0ands≠0 To multiply rational expressions, multiply the numerators and multiply the denominators. We’ll do the first example with numerical fractions to remind us of how we multiplied fractions without variables. Example 8.17 Multiply: 1028·815.1028·815. 1028·815.1028·815.

Remember, throughout this chapter, we will assume that all numerical values that would make the denominator be zero are excluded. We will not write the restrictions for each rational expression, but keep in mind that the denominator can never be zero. So in this next example, x≠0x≠0 and y≠0y≠0. x≠0x≠0 y≠0y≠0 Example 8.18 Mulitply: 2x3y2·6xy3x2y.2x3y2·6xy3x2y. 2x3y2·6xy3x2y.2x3y2·6xy3x2y.

When we divide 35÷435÷4, we first write 4 as a fraction so that we can find its reciprocal. 35÷435÷4 We do the same thing when we divide rational expressions. Example 8.27 Divide: a2−b23ab÷(a2+2ab+b2).a2−b23ab÷(a2+2ab+b2). a2−b23ab÷(a2+2ab+b2).a2−b23ab÷(a2+2ab+b2). Solution Try It 8.53 Divide: 2x2−14x−164÷(x2+2x+1).2x2−14x−164÷(x2+2x+1). 2x2−14x−164÷(x2+2x+1).2x2−14x−164÷(x2+2x+1). Try It 8.54 Divide: y2−6y+8y2−4y÷(3y2−12y).y2−6y+8y2−4y÷(3y2−12y). y2−6y+8y2−4y÷(3y2−12y).y2−6y+8y2−4y÷(3y2−12y). Remember a fraction bar means division. A complex fraction is another way of writing division of two fractions. Example 8.28 Divide: 6x2−7x+24x−82x2−7x+3x2−5x+6.6x2−7x+24x−82x2−7x+3x2−5x+6. 6x2−7x+24x−82x2−7x+3x2−5x+6.6x2−7x+24x−82x2−7x+3x2−5x+6. Solution Try It 8.55 Divide: 3x2+7x+24x+243x2−14x−5x2+x−30.3x2+7x+24x+243x2−14x−5x2+x−30. 3x2+7x+24x+243x2−14x−5x2+x−30.3x2+7x+24x+243x2−14x−5x2+x−30. Try It 8.56 Divide: y2−362y2+11y−62y2−2y−608y−4.y2−362y2+11y−62y2−2y−608y−4. y2−362y2+11y−62y2−2y−608y−4.y2−362y2+11y−62y2−2y−608y−4. If we have more than two rational expressions to work with, we still follow the same procedure. The first step will be to rewrite any division as multiplication by the reciprocal. Then we factor and multiply. Example 8.29 Divide: 3x−64x−4·x2+2x−3x2−3x−10÷2x+128x+16.3x−64x−4·x2+2x−3x2−3x−10÷2x+128x+16. 3x−64x−4·x2+2x−3x2−3x−10÷2x+128x+16.3x−64x−4·x2+2x−3x2−3x−10÷2x+128x+16.

Page 88,"What is the first step you take when you add numerical fractions? You check if they have a common denominator. If they do, you add the numerators and place the sum over the common denominator. If they do not have a common denominator, you find one before you add. It is the same with rational expressions. To add rational expressions, they must have a common denominator. When the denominators are the same, you add the numerators and place the sum over the common denominator. Rational Expression Addition If p,q,andrp,q,andr are polynomials where r≠0r≠0, then p,q,andrp,q,andr r≠0r≠0 To add rational expressions with a common denominator, add the numerators and place the sum over the common denominator. We will add two numerical fractions first, to remind us of how this is done. Example 8.30 Add: 518+718.518+718. 518+718.518+718. Solution Try It 8.59 Add: 716+516.716+516. 716+516.716+516. Try It 8.60 Add: 310+110.310+110. 310+110.310+110. Remember, we do not allow values that would make the denominator zero. What value of yy should be excluded in the next example? yy Example 8.31 Add: 3y4y−3+74y−3.3y4y−3+74y−3. 3y4y−3+74y−3.3y4y−3+74y−3. Solution The numerator and denominator cannot be factored. The fraction is simplified. Try It 8.61 Add: 5x2x+3+22x+3.5x2x+3+22x+3. 5x2x+3+22x+3.5x2x+3+22x+3. Try It 8.62 Add: xx−2+1x−2.xx−2+1x−2. xx−2+1x−2.xx−2+1x−2. Example 8.32 Add: 7x+12x+3+x2x+3.7x+12x+3+x2x+3. 7x+12x+3+x2x+3.7x+12x+3+x2x+3. Solution Try It 8.63 Add: 9x+14x+7+x2x+7.9x+14x+7+x2x+7. 9x+14x+7+x2x+7.9x+14x+7+x2x+7.

Page 88,"To subtract rational expressions, they must also have a common denominator. When the denominators are the same, you subtract the numerators and place the difference over the common denominator. Rational Expression Subtraction If p,q,andrp,q,andr are polynomials where r≠0r≠0, then p,q,andrp,q,andr r≠0r≠0 To subtract rational expressions, subtract the numerators and place the difference over the common denominator. We always simplify rational expressions. Be sure to factor, if possible, after you subtract the numerators so you can identify any common factors. Example 8.33 Subtract: n2n−10−100n−10.n2n−10−100n−10. n2n−10−100n−10.n2n−10−100n−10. Solution Try It 8.65 Subtract: x2x+3−9x+3.x2x+3−9x+3. x2x+3−9x+3.x2x+3−9x+3.

2 . Sarah ran 8 miles and then biked 24 miles. Her biking speed is 4 mph faster than her running speed. If rr represents Sarah’s speed when she ran, then her running time is modeled by the expression 8r8r and her biking time is modeled by the expression 24r+4.24r+4. Add the rational expressions 8r+24r+48r+24r+4 to get an expression for the total amount of time Sarah ran and biked. rr 8r8r 24r+4.24r+4. 8r+24r+48r+24r+4 166 . If Pete can paint a wall in pp hours, then in one hour he can paint 1p1p of the wall. It would take Penelope 3 hours longer than Pete to paint the wall, so in one hour she can paint 1p+31p+3 of the wall. Add the rational expressions 1p+1p+31p+1p+3 to get an expression for the part of the wall Pete and Penelope would paint in one hour if they worked together. pp 1p1p 1p+31p+3 1p+1p+31p+1p+3 167 . Donald thinks that 3x+4x3x+4x is 72x.72x. Is Donald correct? Explain. 3x+4x3x+4x 72x.72x. 168 .

Page 88,". Sarah ran 8 miles and then biked 24 miles. Her biking speed is 4 mph faster than her running speed. If rr represents Sarah’s speed when she ran, then her running time is modeled by the expression 8r8r and her biking time is modeled by the expression 24r+4.24r+4. Add the rational expressions 8r+24r+48r+24r+4 to get an expression for the total amount of time Sarah ran and biked. rr 8r8r 24r+4.24r+4. 8r+24r+48r+24r+4 166 . If Pete can paint a wall in pp hours, then in one hour he can paint 1p1p of the wall. It would take Penelope 3 hours longer than Pete to paint the wall, so in one hour she can paint 1p+31p+3 of the wall. Add the rational expressions 1p+1p+31p+1p+3 to get an expression for the part of the wall Pete and Penelope would paint in one hour if they worked together. pp 1p1p 1p+31p+3 1p+1p+31p+1p+3"

Page 89,"When we add or subtract rational expressions with unlike denominators we will need to get common denominators. If we review the procedure we used with numerical fractions, we will know what to do with rational expressions. Let’s look at the example 712+518712+518 from Foundations. Since the denominators are not the same, the first step was to find the least common denominator (LCD). Remember, the LCD is the least common multiple of the denominators. It is the smallest number we can use as a common denominator. 712+518712+518 To find the LCD of 12 and 18, we factored each number into primes, lining up any common primes in columns. Then we “brought down” one prime from each column. Finally, we multiplied the factors to find the LCD. We do the same thing for rational expressions. However, we leave the LCD in factored form. How To Find the least common denominator of rational expressions. Step 1. Factor each expression completely. Step 2. List the factors of each expression. Match factors vertically when possible. Step 3. Bring down the columns. Step 4. Multiply the factors. Remember, we always exclude values that would make the denominator zero. What values of x should we exclude in this next example? Example 8.38 Find the LCD for 8x2−2x−3,3xx2+4x+38x2−2x−3,3xx2+4x+3. 8x2−2x−3,3xx2+4x+38x2−2x−3,3xx2+4x+3 Solution Try It 8.75 Find the LCD for 2x2−x−12,1x2−162x2−x−12,1x2−16. 2x2−x−12,1x2−162x2−x−12,1x2−16 Try It 8.76 Find the LCD for xx2+8x+15,5x2+9x+18xx2+8x+15,5x2+9x+18. xx2+8x+15,5x2+9x+18xx2+8x+15,5x2+9x+18"

Page 89,"When we add numerical fractions, once we find the LCD, we rewrite each fraction as an equivalent fraction with the LCD. We will do the same thing for rational expressions. Example 8.39 Rewrite as equivalent rational expressions with denominator (x+1)(x−3)(x+3)(x+1)(x−3)(x+3): 8x2−2x−3,3xx2+4x+3.8x2−2x−3,3xx2+4x+3.

Page 89,"Now we have all the steps we need to add rational expressions with different denominators. As we have done previously, we will do one example of adding numerical fractions first. Example 8.40 Add: 712+518.712+518. 712+518.712+518. Solution Try It 8.79 Add: 1130+712.1130+712. 1130+712.1130+712. Try It 8.80 Add: 38+920.38+920. 38+920.38+920. Now we will add rational expressions whose denominators are monomials. Example 8.41 Add: 512x2y+421xy2.512x2y+421xy2. 512x2y+421xy2.512x2y+421xy2. Solution Try It 8.81 Add: 215a2b+56ab2.215a2b+56ab2. 215a2b+56ab2.215a2b+56ab2. Try It 8.82 Add: 516c+38cd2.516c+38cd2. 516c+38cd2.516c+38cd2. Now we are ready to tackle polynomial denominators. Example 8.42 Add: 3x−3+2x−2.3x−3+2x−2. 3x−3+2x−2.3x−3+2x−2. Solution Try It 8.83 Add: 2x−2+5x+3.2x−2+5x+3. 2x−2+5x+3.2x−2+5x+3. Try It 8.84 Add: 4m+3+3m+4.4m+3+3m+4. 4m+3+3m+4.4m+3+3m+4. The steps to use to add rational expressions are summarized in the following procedure box. How To Add rational expressions. Step 1. Determine if the expressions have a common denominator.
Yes – go to step 2.
No – Rewrite each rational expression with the LCD.
Find the LCD.
Rewrite each rational expression as an equivalent rational expression with the LCD. Step 2. Add the rational expressions. Step 3. Simplify, if possible. Example 8.43 Add: 2a2ab+b2+3a4a2−b2.2a2ab+b2+3a4a2−b2. 2a2ab+b2+3a4a2−b2.2a2ab+b2+3a4a2−b2. Solution Try It 8.85 Add: 5xxy−y2+2xx2−y2.5xxy−y2+2xx2−y2. 5xxy−y2+2xx2−y2.5xxy−y2+2xx2−y2.

In the example above, we must leave the first rational expression as 2a(2a−b)b(2a+b)(2a−b)2a(2a−b)b(2a+b)(2a−b) to be able to add it to 3a·b(2a+b)(2a−b)·b3a·b(2a+b)(2a−b)·b. Simplify only after you have combined the numerators. 2a(2a−b)b(2a+b)(2a−b)2a(2a−b)b(2a+b)(2a−b) 3a·b(2a+b)(2a−b)·b3a·b(2a+b)(2a−b)·b Example 8.44 Add: 8x2−2x−3+3xx2+4x+3.8x2−2x−3+3xx2+4x+3. 8x2−2x−3+3xx2+4x+3.8x2−2x−3+3xx2+4x+3.

Page 89,"The process we use to subtract rational expressions with different denominators is the same as for addition. We just have to be very careful of the signs when subtracting the numerators. Example 8.45 Subtract: xx−3−x−2x+3.xx−3−x−2x+3. xx−3−x−2x+3.xx−3−x−2x+3. Solution Try It 8.89 Subtract: yy+4−y−2y−5.yy+4−y−2y−5. yy+4−y−2y−5.yy+4−y−2y−5.

Yes – go to step 2.
No – Rewrite each rational expression with the LCD.
Find the LCD.
Rewrite each rational expression as an equivalent rational expression with the LCD. Step 2. Add or subtract the rational expressions. Step 3. Simplify, if possible. We follow the same steps as before to find the LCD when we have more than two rational expressions. In the next example we will start by factoring all three denominators to find their LCD. Example 8.49 Simplify: 2uu−1+1u−2u−1u2−u.2uu−1+1u−2u−1u2−u. 2uu−1+1u−2u−1u2−u.2uu−1+1u−2u−1u2−u. Solution Try It 8.97 Simplify: vv+1+3v−1−6v2−1.vv+1+3v−1−6v2−1. vv+1+3v−1−6v2−1.vv+1+3v−1−6v2−1.

Page 90,"We have already seen this complex rational expression earlier in this chapter. We noted that fraction bars tell us to divide, so rewrote it as the division problem Then we multiplied the first rational expression by the reciprocal of the second, just like we do when we divide two fractions. This is one method to simplify rational expressions. We write it as if we were dividing two fractions. Example 8.50 Simplify: 4y−38y2−9.4y−38y2−9. 4y−38y2−9.4y−38y2−9. Solution Are there any value(s) of yy that should not be allowed? The simplified rational expression has just a constant in the denominator. But the original complex rational expression had denominators of y−3y−3 and y2−9y2−9. This expression would be undefined if y=3y=3 or y=−3y=−3. yy complex rational expression y−3y−3 y2−9y2−9 y=3y=3 y=−3y=−3 Try It 8.99 Simplify: 2x2−13x+1.2x2−13x+1. 2x2−13x+1.2x2−13x+1. Try It 8.100 Simplify: 1x2−7x+122x−4.1x2−7x+122x−4. 1x2−7x+122x−4.1x2−7x+122x−4. Fraction bars act as grouping symbols. So to follow the Order of Operations, we simplify the numerator and denominator as much as possible before we can do the division. Example 8.51 Simplify: 13+1612−13.13+1612−13. 13+1612−13.13+1612−13. Solution Try It 8.101 Simplify: 12+2356+112.12+2356+112. 12+2356+112.12+2356+112. Try It 8.102 Simplify: 34−1318+56.34−1318+56. 34−1318+56.34−1318+56. Example 8.52 Simplify: 1x+1yxy−yx.1x+1yxy−yx. 1x+1yxy−yx.1x+1yxy−yx. Solution Try It 8.103 Simplify: 1x+1y1x−1y.1x+1y1x−1y. 1x+1y1x−1y.1x+1y1x−1y. Try It 8.104 Simplify: 1a+1b1a2−1b2.1a+1b1a2−1b2. 1a+1b1a2−1b2.1a+1b1a2−1b2. How To Simplify a complex rational expression by writing it as division. Step 1. Simplify the numerator and denominator. Step 2. Rewrite the complex rational expression as a division problem. Step 3. Divide the expressions. Example 8.53 Simplify: n−4nn+51n+5+1n−5.n−4nn+51n+5+1n−5. n−4nn+51n+5+1n−5.n−4nn+51n+5+1n−5.

Page 90,"We “cleared” the fractions by multiplying by the LCD when we solved equations with fractions. We can use that strategy here to simplify complex rational expressions. We will multiply the numerator and denominator by LCD of all the rational expressions. Let’s look at the complex rational expression we simplified one way in Example 8.51. We will simplify it here by multiplying the numerator and denominator by the LCD. When we multiply by LCDLCDLCDLCD we are multiplying by 1, so the value stays the same.

3 . Electronics The resistance of a circuit formed by connecting two resistors in parallel is 11R1+1R211R1+1R2. 11R1+1R211R1+1R2 ⓐ ⓑ 300 . Ironing Lenore can do the ironing for her family’s business in hh hours. Her daughter would take h+2h+2 hours to get the ironing done. If Lenore and her daughter work together, using 2 irons, the number of hours it would take them to do all the ironing is 11h+1h+211h+1h+2. hh h+2h+2 11h+1h+211h+1h+2 ⓐ ⓑ . In this section, you learned to simplify the complex fraction 3x+2xx2−43x+2xx2−4 two ways: 3x+2xx2−43x+2xx2−4 rewriting it as a division problem multiplying the numerator and denominator by the LCD Which method do you prefer? Why? 302 . Efraim wants to start simplifying the complex fraction 1a+1b1a−1b1a+1b1a−1b by cancelling the variables from the numerator and denominator. Explain what is wrong with Efraim’s plan. 1a+1b1a−1b1a+1b1a−1b ⓐ After completing the exercises, use this checklist to evaluate your mastery of the objectives of this section. ⓐ ⓑ After looking at the checklist, do you think you are well-prepared for the next section?

Page 91,"We have already solved linear equations that contained fractions. We found the LCD of all the fractions in the equation and then multiplied both sides of the equation by the LCD to “clear” the fractions. Here is an example we did when we worked with linear equations: We will use the same strategy to solve rational equations. We will multiply both sides of the equation by the LCD. Then we will have an equation that does not contain rational expressions and thus is much easier for us to solve. But because the original equation may have a variable in a denominator we must be careful that we don’t end up with a solution that would make a denominator equal to zero. So before we begin solving a rational equation, we examine it first to find the values that would make any denominators zero. That way, when we solve a rational equation we will know if there are any algebraic solutions we must discard. rational equation An algebraic solution to a rational equation that would cause any of the rational expressions to be undefined is called an extraneous solution. Extraneous Solution to a Rational Equation An extraneous solution to a rational equation is an algebraic solution that would cause any of the expressions in the original equation to be undefined. extraneous solution to a rational equation We note any possible extraneous solutions, c, by writing x≠cx≠c next to the equation. x≠cx≠c Example 8.59 Solve: 1x+13=56.1x+13=56. 1x+13=56.1x+13=56. Solution Try It 8.117 Solve: 1y+23=15.1y+23=15. 1y+23=15.1y+23=15. Try It 8.118 Solve: 23+15=1x.23+15=1x. 23+15=1x.23+15=1x. The steps of this method are shown below. How To Solve equations with rational expressions. Step 1. Note any value of the variable that would make any denominator zero. Step 2. Find the least common denominator of all denominators in the equation. Step 3. Clear the fractions by multiplying both sides of the equation by the LCD. Step 4. Solve the resulting equation. Step 5. We always start by noting the values that would cause any denominators to be zero. Example 8.60 Solve: 1−5y=−6y2.1−5y=−6y2. 1−5y=−6y2.1−5y=−6y2. Solution Try It 8.119 Solve: 1−2a=15a2.1−2a=15a2. 1−2a=15a2.1−2a=15a2. Try It 8.120 Solve: 1−4b=12b2.1−4b=12b2. 1−4b=12b2.1−4b=12b2. Example 8.61 Solve: 53u−2=32u.53u−2=32u. 53u−2=32u.53u−2=32u.

Page 91,"When we solved linear equations, we learned how to solve a formula for a specific variable. Many formulas used in business, science, economics, and other fields use rational equations to model the relation between two or more variables. We will now see how to solve a rational equation for a specific variable. We’ll start with a formula relating distance, rate, and time. We have used it many times before, but not usually in this form. Example 8.68 Solve: DT=RforT.DT=RforT. DT=RforT.DT=RforT. Solution Try It 8.135 Solve: AL=WAL=W for L.L. AL=WAL=W L.L. Try It 8.136 Solve: FA=MFA=M for A.A. FA=MFA=M A.A. Example 8.69 uses the formula for slope that we used to get the point-slope form of an equation of a line. Example 8.69 Solve: m=x−2y−3fory.m=x−2y−3fory. m=x−2y−3fory.m=x−2y−3fory. Solution Try It 8.137 Solve: y−2x+1=23y−2x+1=23 for x.x. y−2x+1=23y−2x+1=23 x.x. Try It 8.138 Solve: x=y1−yx=y1−y for y.y. x=y1−yx=y1−y y.y. Be sure to follow all the steps in Example 8.70. It may look like a very simple formula, but we cannot solve it instantly for either denominator. Example 8.70 Solve 1c+1m=1forc.1c+1m=1forc. 1c+1m=1forc.1c+1m=1forc. Solution Notice that even though we excluded c=0andm=0c=0andm=0 from the original equation, we must also now state that m≠1m≠1. c=0andm=0c=0andm=0 m≠1m≠1 Try It 8.139 Solve: 1a+1b=c1a+1b=c for a.a. 1a+1b=c1a+1b=c a.a. Try It 8.140 Solve: 2x+13=1y2x+13=1y for y.y. 2x+13=1y2x+13=1y y.y."

Page 92,"When two rational expressions are equal, the equation relating them is called a proportion. Proportion A proportion is an equation of the form ab=cdab=cd, where b≠0,d≠0b≠0,d≠0. proportion ab=cdab=cd b≠0,d≠0b≠0,d≠0 The proportion is read “aa is to bb, as cc is to dd.” aa bb cc dd The equation 12=4812=48 is a proportion because the two fractions are equal. The proportion 12=4812=48 is read “1 is to 2 as 4 is to 8.” 12=4812=48 12=4812=48 Proportions are used in many applications to ‘scale up’ quantities. We’ll start with a very simple example so you can see how proportions work. Even if you can figure out the answer to the example right away, make sure you also learn to solve it using proportions. Suppose a school principal wants to have 1 teacher for 20 students. She could use proportions to find the number of teachers for 60 students. We let x be the number of teachers for 60 students and then set up the proportion: We are careful to match the units of the numerators and the units of the denominators—teachers in the numerators, students in the denominators. Since a proportion is an equation with rational expressions, we will solve proportions the same way we solved equations in Solve Rational Equations. We’ll multiply both sides of the equation by the LCD to clear the fractions and then solve the resulting equation. So let’s finish solving the principal’s problem now. We will omit writing the units until the last step. Now we’ll do a few examples of solving numerical proportions without any units. Then we will solve applications using proportions. Example 8.71 Solve the proportion: x63=47.x63=47. x63=47.x63=47. Solution Try It 8.141 Solve the proportion: n84=1112.n84=1112. n84=1112.n84=1112. Try It 8.142 Solve the proportion: y96=1312.y96=1312. y96=1312.y96=1312. When we work with proportions, we exclude values that would make either denominator zero, just like we do for all rational expressions. What value(s) should be excluded for the proportion in the next example? proportion Example 8.72 Solve the proportion: 144a=94.144a=94. 144a=94.144a=94. Solution Try It 8.143 Solve the proportion: 91b=75.91b=75. 91b=75.91b=75. Try It 8.144 Solve the proportion: 39c=138.39c=138. 39c=138.39c=138. Example 8.73 Solve the proportion: nn+14=57.nn+14=57. nn+14=57.nn+14=57. Solution Try It 8.145 Solve the proportion: yy+55=38.yy+55=38. yy+55=38.yy+55=38. Try It 8.146 Solve the proportion: zz−84=−15.zz−84=−15. zz−84=−15.zz−84=−15. Example 8.74 Solve: p+129=p−126.p+129=p−126. p+129=p−126.p+129=p−126. Solution Try It 8.147 Solve: v+308=v+6612.v+308=v+6612. v+308=v+6612.v+308=v+6612. Try It 8.148 Solve: 2x+159=7x+315.2x+159=7x+315. 2x+159=7x+315.2x+159=7x+315. To solve applications with proportions, we will follow our usual strategy for solving applications. But when we set up the proportion, we must make sure to have the units correct—the units in the numerators must match and the units in the denominators must match. Example 8.75 When pediatricians prescribe acetaminophen to children, they prescribe 5 milliliters (ml) of acetaminophen for every 25 pounds of the child’s weight. If Zoe weighs 80 pounds, how many milliliters of acetaminophen will her doctor prescribe? Solution Try It 8.149 Pediatricians prescribe 5 milliliters (ml) of acetaminophen for every 25 pounds of a child’s weight. How many milliliters of acetaminophen will the doctor prescribe for Emilia, who weighs 60 pounds? Try It 8.150 For every 1 kilogram (kg) of a child’s weight, pediatricians prescribe 15 milligrams (mg) of a fever reducer. If Isabella weighs 12 kg, how many milligrams of the fever reducer will the pediatrician prescribe? Example 8.76 A 16-ounce iced caramel macchiato has 230 calories. How many calories are there in a 24-ounce iced caramel macchiato? Solution Try It 8.151 At a fast-food restaurant, a 22-ounce chocolate shake has 850 calories. How many calories are in their 12-ounce chocolate shake? Round your answer to nearest whole number. Try It 8.152 Yaneli loves Starburst candies, but wants to keep her snacks to 100 calories. If the candies have 160 calories for 8 pieces, how many pieces can she have in her snack? Example 8.77 Josiah went to Mexico for spring break and changed $325 dollars into Mexican pesos. At that time, the exchange rate had $1 US is equal to 12.54 Mexican pesos. How many Mexican pesos did he get for his trip? Solution Try It 8.153 Yurianna is going to Europe and wants to change $800 dollars into Euros. At the current exchange rate, $1 US is equal to 0.738 Euro. How many Euros will she have for her trip? Try It 8.154 Corey and Nicole are traveling to Japan and need to exchange $600 into Japanese yen. If each dollar is 94.1 yen, how many yen will they get? In the example above, we related the number of pesos to the number of dollars by using a proportion. We could say the number of pesos is proportional to the number of dollars. If two quantities are related by a proportion, we say that they are proportional."

Page 92,"When you shrink or enlarge a photo on a phone or tablet, figure out a distance on a map, or use a pattern to build a bookcase or sew a dress, you are working with similar figures. If two figures have exactly the same shape, but different sizes, they are said to be similar. One is a scale model of the other. All their corresponding angles have the same measures and their corresponding sides are in the same ratio. similar figures Similar Figures Two figures are similar if the measures of their corresponding angles are equal and their corresponding sides are in the same ratio. For example, the two triangles in Figure 8.2 are similar. Each side of ΔABCΔABC is 4 times the length of the corresponding side of ΔXYZΔXYZ. ΔABCΔABC ΔXYZΔXYZ Figure 8.2 This is summed up in the Property of Similar Triangles. Property of Similar Triangles If ΔABCΔABC is similar to ΔXYZΔXYZ, then their corresponding angle measure are equal and their corresponding sides are in the same ratio. ΔABCΔABC ΔXYZΔXYZ To solve applications with similar figures we will follow the Problem-Solving Strategy for Geometry Applications we used earlier. How To Solve geometry applications. Step 1. Read the problem and make all the words and ideas are understood. Draw the figure and label it with the given information. Step 2. Identify what we are looking for. Step 3.

Substitute in the given information. Step 5. Solve the equation using good algebra techniques. Step 6. Check the answer in the problem and make sure it makes sense. Step 7. Answer the question with a complete sentence. Example 8.78 ΔABCΔABC is similar to ΔXYZΔXYZ. The lengths of two sides of each triangle are given. Find the lengths of the third sides. ΔABCΔABC ΔXYZΔXYZ Solution Try It 8.155 ΔABCΔABC is similar to ΔXYZΔXYZ. The lengths of two sides of each triangle are given in the figure. ΔABCΔABC ΔXYZΔXYZ Find the length of side aa. aa Try It 8.156 ΔABCΔABC is similar to ΔXYZΔXYZ. The lengths of two sides of each triangle are given in the figure. ΔABCΔABC ΔXYZΔXYZ Find the length of side yy. yy The next example shows how similar triangles are used with maps. Example 8.79 On a map, San Francisco, Las Vegas, and Los Angeles form a triangle whose sides are shown in the figure below. If the actual distance from Los Angeles to Las Vegas is 270 miles find the distance from Los Angeles to San Francisco. Solution Try It 8.157 On the map, Seattle, Portland, and Boise form a triangle whose sides are shown in the figure below. If the actual distance from Seattle to Boise is 400 miles, find the distance from Seattle to Portland. Try It 8.158 Using the map above, find the distance from Portland to Boise. We can use similar figures to find heights that we cannot directly measure. similar figures Example 8.80 Tyler is 6 feet tall. Late one afternoon, his shadow was 8 feet long. At the same time, the shadow of a tree was 24 feet long. Find the height of the tree. Solution Try It 8.159 A telephone pole casts a shadow that is 50 feet long. Nearby, an 8 foot tall traffic sign casts a shadow that is 10 feet long. How tall is the telephone pole? Try It 8.160 A pine tree casts a shadow of 80 feet next to a 30-foot tall building which casts a 40 feet shadow. How tall is the pine tree?"

Page 93,"We have solved uniform motion problems using the formula D=rtD=rt in previous chapters. We used a table like the one below to organize the information and lead us to the equation. D=rtD=rt The formula D=rtD=rt assumes we know r and t and use them to find D. If we know D and r and need to find t, we would solve the equation for t and get the formula t=Drt=Dr. D=rtD=rt t=Drt=Dr We have also explained how flying with or against a current affects the speed of a vehicle. We will revisit that idea in the next example. Example 8.81 An airplane can fly 200 miles into a 30 mph headwind in the same amount of time it takes to fly 300 miles with a 30 mph tailwind. What is the speed of the airplane? Solution This is a uniform motion situation. A diagram will help us visualize the situation. We fill in the chart to organize the information. Try It 8.161 Link can ride his bike 20 miles into a 3 mph headwind in the same amount of time he can ride 30 miles with a 3 mph tailwind. What is Link’s biking speed? Try It 8.162 Judy can pilot her powerboat 5 miles into a 7 mph wind in the same amount of time she can cover 12 miles with a 7 mph tailwind. What is the speed of Judy’s boat without a wind? In the next example, we will know the total time resulting from travelling different distances at different speeds. Example 8.82 Jazmine trained for 3 hours on Saturday. She ran 8 miles and then biked 24 miles. Her biking speed is 4 mph faster than her running speed. What is her running speed? Solution This is a uniform motion situation. A diagram will help us visualize the situation. We fill in the chart to organize the information. Try It 8.163 Dennis went cross-country skiing for 6 hours on Saturday. He skied 20 miles uphill and then 20 miles back downhill, returning to his starting point. His uphill speed was 5 mph slower than his downhill speed. What was Dennis’ speed going uphill and his speed going downhill? Try It 8.164 Tony drove 4 hours to his home, driving 208 miles on the interstate and 40 miles on country roads. If he drove 15 mph faster on the interstate than on the country roads, what was his rate on the country roads? Once again, we will use the uniform motion formula solved for the variable t. Example 8.83 Hamilton rode his bike downhill 12 miles on the river trail from his house to the ocean and then rode uphill to return home. His uphill speed was 8 miles per hour slower than his downhill speed. It took him 2 hours longer to get home than it took him to get to the ocean. Find Hamilton’s downhill speed. Solution This is a uniform motion situation. A diagram will help us visualize the situation. We fill in the chart to organize the information. Try It 8.165 Kayla rode her bike 75 miles home from college one weekend and then rode the bus back to college. It took her 2 hours less to ride back to college on the bus than it took her to ride home on her bike, and the average speed of the bus was 10 miles per hour faster than Kayla’s biking speed. Find Kayla’s biking speed. Try It 8.166 Victoria jogs 12 miles to the park along a flat trail and then returns by jogging on a 20 mile hilly trail. She jogs 1 mile per hour slower on the hilly trail than on the flat trail, and her return trip takes her two hours longer. Find her rate of jogging on the flat trail."

Page 93,"Suppose Pete can paint a room in 10 hours. If he works at a steady pace, in 1 hour he would paint 110110 of the room. If Alicia would take 8 hours to paint the same room, then in 1 hour she would paint 1818 of the room. How long would it take Pete and Alicia to paint the room if they worked together (and didn’t interfere with each other’s progress)? 110110 1818 This is a typical ‘work’ application. There are three quantities involved here – the time it would take each of the two people to do the job alone and the time it would take for them to do the job together. Let’s get back to Pete and Alicia painting the room. We will let t be the number of hours it would take them to paint the room together. So in 1 hour working together they have completed 1t1t of the job. 1t1t In one hour Pete did 110110 of the job. Alicia did 1818 of the job. And together they did 1t1t of the job. 110110 1818 1t1t We can model this with the word equation and then translate to a rational equation. To find the time it would take them if they worked together, we solve for t. Keep in mind, it should take less time for two people to complete a job working together than for either person to do it alone. Example 8.84 The weekly gossip magazine has a big story about the Princess’ baby and the editor wants the magazine to be printed as soon as possible. She has asked the printer to run an extra printing press to get the printing done more quickly. Press #1 takes 6 hours to do the job and Press #2 takes 12 hours to do the job. How long will it take the printer to get the magazine printed with both presses running together? Solution This is a work problem. A chart will help us organize the information. Try It 8.167 One gardener can mow a golf course in 4 hours, while another gardener can mow the same golf course in 6 hours. How long would it take if the two gardeners worked together to mow the golf course? Try It 8.168 Carrie can weed the garden in 7 hours, while her mother can do it in 3. How long will it take the two of them working together? Example 8.85 Corey can shovel all the snow from the sidewalk and driveway in 4 hours. If he and his twin Casey work together, they can finish shoveling the snow in 2 hours. How many hours would it take Casey to do the job by himself? Solution Try It 8.169 Two hoses can fill a swimming pool in 10 hours. It would take one hose 26 hours to fill the pool by itself. How long would it take for the other hose, working alone, to fill the pool? Try It 8.170 Cara and Cindy, working together, can rake the yard in 4 hours. Working alone, it takes Cindy 6 hours to rake the yard. How long would it take Cara to rake the yard alone?"

Page 94,"Lindsay gets paid $15 per hour at her job. If we let s be her salary and h be the number of hours she has worked, we could model this situation with the equation Lindsay’s salary is the product of a constant, 15, and the number of hours she works. We say that Lindsay’s salary varies directly with the number of hours she works. Two variables vary directly if one is the product of a constant and the other. Direct Variation For any two variables x and y, y varies directly with x if The constant k is called the constant of variation. In applications using direct variation, generally we will know values of one pair of the variables and will be asked to find the equation that relates x and y. Then we can use that equation to find values of y for other values of x. Example 8.86 If y varies directly with x and y=20y=20 when x=8x=8, find the equation that relates x and y. y=20y=20 x=8x=8 Solution Try It 8.171 If yy varies directly as xx and y=3,whenx=10.y=3,whenx=10. find the equation that relates x and y. yy xx y=3,whenx=10.y=3,whenx=10.

How To Solve direct variation problems. Step 1. Write the formula for direct variation. Step 2. Substitute the given values for the variables. Step 3. Solve for the constant of variation. Step 4. Write the equation that relates x and y. Now we’ll solve a few applications of direct variation. Example 8.87 When Raoul runs on the treadmill at the gym, the number of calories, c, he burns varies directly with the number of minutes, m, he uses the treadmill.

The number of hours it takes for ice to melt varies inversely with the air temperature. A block of ice melts in 2.5 hours when the temperature is 54 degrees. How long would it take for the same block of ice to melt if the temperature was 45 degrees? . The length a spring stretches varies directly with a weight placed at the end of the spring. When Meredith placed a 6-pound cantaloupe on a hanging scale, the spring stretched 2 inches. How far would the spring stretch if the cantaloupe weighed 9 pounds? 504 . The amount that June gets paid varies directly the number of hours she works. When she worked 15 hours, she got paid $111. How much will she be paid for working 18 hours? . The fuel consumption (mpg) of a car varies inversely with its weight. A Ford Focus weighs 3000 pounds and gets 28.7 mpg on the highway. What would the fuel consumption be for a Ford Expedition that weighs 5,500 pounds? Round to the nearest tenth. 506 . The volume of a gas in a container varies inversely as the pressure on the gas. If a container of argon has a volume of 336 cubic inches under a pressure of 2,500 psi, what will be its volume if the pressure is decreased to 2,000 psi? . The distance an object falls varies directly to the square of the time it falls. If an object falls 52.8 feet in 4 seconds, how far will it fall in 9 seconds? 508 . The area of the face of a Ferris wheel varies directly with the square of its radius. If the area of one face of a Ferris wheel with diameter 150 feet is 70,650 square feet, what is the area of one face of a Ferris wheel with diameter of 16 feet?"

Page 100,"Remember that when a number nn is multiplied by itself, we write n2n2 and read it “n squared.” For example, 152152 reads as “15 squared,” and 225 is called the square of 15, since 152=225152=225. nn n2n2 152152 152=225152=225 Square of a Number If n2=mn2=m, then mm is the square of nn. n2=mn2=m mm nn Sometimes we will need to look at the relationship between numbers and their squares in reverse. Because 225 is the square of 15, we can also say that 15 is a square root of 225. A number whose square is mm is called a square root of mm. mm mm Square Root of a Number If n2=mn2=m, then nn is a square root of mm. n2=mn2=m nn mm Notice (−15)2=225(−15)2=225 also, so −15−15 is also a square root of 225. Therefore, both 15 and −15−15 are square roots of 225. (−15)2=225(−15)2=225 −15−15 −15−15 So, every positive number has two square roots—one positive and one negative. What if we only wanted the positive square root of a positive number? The radical sign, mm, denotes the positive square root. The positive square root is also called the principal square root. mm We also use the radical sign for the square root of zero. Because 02=002=0, 0=00=0. Notice that zero has only one square root. 02=002=0 0=00=0 Square Root Notation mm is read as “the square root of mm.” mm mm If m=n2m=n2, then m=nm=n, for n≥0n≥0. m=n2m=n2 m=nm=n n≥0n≥0 The square root of mm, mm, is the positive number whose square is mm. mm mm mm Since 15 is the positive square root of 225, we write 225=15225=15. Fill in Figure 9.2 to make a table of square roots you can refer to as you work this chapter. 225=15225=15 Figure 9.2 We know that every positive number has two square roots and the radical sign indicates the positive one. We write 225=15225=15. If we want to find the negative square root of a number, we place a negative in front of the radical sign. For example, −225=−15−225=−15. 225=15225=15 −225=−15−225=−15 Example 9.1 Simplify: ⓐ 3636 ⓑ 196196 ⓒ −81−81 ⓓ −289−289. ⓐ 3636 ⓑ 196196 ⓒ −81−81 ⓓ −289−289 Solution ⓐ ⓐ ⓑ ⓑ ⓒ ⓒ ⓓ ⓓ Try It 9.1 Simplify: ⓐ −49−49 ⓑ 225225. ⓐ −49−49 ⓑ 225225 Try It 9.2 Simplify: ⓐ 6464 ⓑ −121−121. ⓐ 6464 ⓑ −121−121 Example 9.2 Simplify: ⓐ −169−169 ⓑ −64−64. ⓐ −169−169 ⓑ −64−64 Solution ⓐ ⓐ ⓑ ⓑ Try It 9.3 Simplify: ⓐ −196−196 ⓑ −81−81. ⓐ −196−196 ⓑ −81−81 Try It 9.4 Simplify: ⓐ −49−49 ⓑ −121−121. ⓐ −49−49 ⓑ −121−121 When using the order of operations to simplify an expression that has square roots, we treat the radical as a grouping symbol.

Page 100,"So far we have only considered square roots of perfect square numbers. The square roots of other numbers are not whole numbers. Look at Table 9.1 below. Table 9.1 The square roots of numbers between 4 and 9 must be between the two consecutive whole numbers 2 and 3, and they are not whole numbers. Based on the pattern in the table above, we could say that 55 must be between 2 and 3. Using inequality symbols, we write: 55 Example 9.4 Estimate 6060 between two consecutive whole numbers. 6060 Solution Think of the perfect square numbers closest to 60. Make a small table of these perfect squares and their squares roots. Try It 9.7 Estimate the square root 3838 between two consecutive whole numbers. 3838 Try It 9.8 Estimate the square root 8484 between two consecutive whole numbers. 8484"
Page 100,"There are mathematical methods to approximate square roots, but nowadays most people use a calculator to find them. Find the xx key on your calculator. You will use this key to approximate square roots. xx When you use your calculator to find the square root of a number that is not a perfect square, the answer that you see is not the exact square root. It is an approximation, accurate to the number of digits shown on your calculator’s display. The symbol for an approximation is ≈≈ and it is read ‘approximately.’ ≈≈ Suppose your calculator has a 10-digit display. You would see that If we wanted to round 55 to two decimal places, we would say 55 How do we know these values are approximations and not the exact values? Look at what happens when we square them: Their squares are close to 5, but are not exactly equal to 5. Using the square root key on a calculator and then rounding to two decimal places, we can find: Example 9.5 Round 1717 to two decimal places. 1717 Solution Try It 9.9 Round 1111 to two decimal places. 1111 Try It 9.10 Round 1313 to two decimal places. 1313"

Can you think of an expression whose square is 9x29x2? 9x29x2 9x29x2 When we use the radical sign to take the square root of a variable expression, we should specify that x≥0x≥0 to make sure we get the principal square root. x≥0x≥0 However, in this chapter we will assume that each variable in a square-root expression represents a non-negative number and so we will not write x≥0x≥0 next to every radical. x≥0x≥0 What about square roots of higher powers of variables? Think about the Power Property of Exponents we used in Chapter 6. If we square amam, the exponent will become 2m2m. amam 2m2m How does this help us take square roots?

Page 101,"The properties we will use to simplify expressions with square roots are similar to the properties of exponents. We know that (ab)m=ambm(ab)m=ambm. The corresponding property of square roots says that ab=a·bab=a·b. (ab)m=ambm(ab)m=ambm ab=a·bab=a·b Product Property of Square Roots If a, b are non-negative real numbers, then ab=a·bab=a·b. ab=a·bab=a·b We use the Product Property of Square Roots to remove all perfect square factors from a radical. We will show how to do this in Example 9.12. Example 9.12 Simplify: 5050. 5050 Solution Try It 9.23 Simplify: 4848. 4848 Try It 9.24 Simplify: 4545. 4545 Notice in the previous example that the simplified form of 5050 is 5252, which is the product of an integer and a square root. We always write the integer in front of the square root. 5050 5252 How To Simplify a square root using the product property. Step 1. Find the largest perfect square factor of the radicand. Rewrite the radicand as a product using the perfect-square factor. Step 2. Use the product rule to rewrite the radical as the product of two radicals. Step 3. Simplify the square root of the perfect square. Example 9.13 Simplify: 500500. 500500 Solution Try It 9.25 Simplify: 288288. 288288 Try It 9.26 Simplify: 432432. 432432 We could use the simplified form 105105 to estimate 500500. We know 5 is between 2 and 3, and 500500 is 105105. So 500500 is between 20 and 30. 105105 500500 500500 105105 500500 The next example is much like the previous examples, but with variables. Example 9.14 Simplify: x3x3. x3x3 Solution Try It 9.27 Simplify: b5b5. b5b5 Try It 9.28 Simplify: p9p9. p9p9 We follow the same procedure when there is a coefficient in the radical, too. Example 9.15 Simplify: 25y5.25y5. 25y5.25y5. Solution Try It 9.29 Simplify: 16x716x7. 16x716x7 Try It 9.30 Simplify: 49v949v9. 49v949v9 In the next example both the constant and the variable have perfect square factors. Example 9.16 Simplify: 72n772n7. 72n772n7 Solution Try It 9.31 Simplify: 32y532y5. 32y532y5 Try It 9.32 Simplify: 75a975a9. 75a975a9 Example 9.17 Simplify: 63u3v563u3v5. 63u3v563u3v5 Solution Try It 9.33 Simplify: 98a7b598a7b5. 98a7b598a7b5 Try It 9.34 Simplify: 180m9n11180m9n11. 180m9n11180m9n11 We have seen how to use the Order of Operations to simplify some expressions with radicals. To simplify 25+14425+144 we must simplify each square root separately first, then add to get the sum of 17. 25+14425+144 The expression 17+717+7 cannot be simplified—to begin we’d need to simplify each square root, but neither 17 nor 7 contains a perfect square factor. 17+717+7 In the next example, we have the sum of an integer and a square root. We simplify the square root but cannot add the resulting expression to the integer. Example 9.18 Simplify: 3+323+32. 3+323+32 Solution The terms are not like and so we cannot add them. Trying to add an integer and a radical is like trying to add an integer and a variable—they are not like terms! Try It 9.35 Simplify: 5+755+75. 5+755+75 Try It 9.36 Simplify: 2+982+98. 2+982+98 The next example includes a fraction with a radical in the numerator. Remember that in order to simplify a fraction you need a common factor in the numerator and denominator. Example 9.19 Simplify: 4−4824−482. 4−4824−482 Solution Try It 9.37 Simplify: 10−75510−755. 10−75510−755 Try It 9.38 Simplify: 6−4536−453. 6−4536−453"
Page 101,Solution
Page 101,"Whenever you have to simplify a square root, the first step you should take is to determine whether the radicand is a perfect square. A perfect square fraction is a fraction in which both the numerator and the denominator are perfect squares. Example 9.20 Simplify: 964964. 964964 Solution 9

Example 9.21 Simplify: 45804580. 45804580 Solution Try It 9.41 Simplify: 75487548. 75487548 Try It 9.42 Simplify: 9816298162. 9816298162 In the last example, our first step was to simplify the fraction under the radical by removing common factors. In the next example we will use the Quotient Property to simplify under the radical. We divide the like bases by subtracting their exponents, aman=am−n,a≠0aman=am−n,a≠0. aman=am−n,a≠0aman=am−n,a≠0 Example 9.22 Simplify: m6m4m6m4. m6m4m6m4 Solution Try It 9.43 Simplify: a8a6a8a6. a8a6a8a6 Try It 9.44 Simplify: x14x10x14x10. x14x10x14x10 Example 9.23 Simplify: 48p73p348p73p3. 48p73p348p73p3 Solution Try It 9.45 Simplify: 75x53x75x53x. 75x53x75x53x Try It 9.46 Simplify: 72z122z1072z122z10. 72z122z1072z122z10 Remember the Quotient to a Power Property? It said we could raise a fraction to a power by raising the numerator and denominator to the power separately. We can use a similar property to simplify a square root of a fraction. After removing all common factors from the numerator and denominator, if the fraction is not a perfect square we simplify the numerator and denominator separately. Quotient Property of Square Roots If a, b are non-negative real numbers and b≠0b≠0, then b≠0b≠0 Example 9.24 Simplify: 21642164. 21642164 Solution Try It 9.47 Simplify: 19491949. 19491949 Try It 9.48 Simplify: 28812881. 28812881 Example 9.25 Simplify: 27m319627m3196. 27m319627m3196 Solution Try It 9.49 Simplify: 24p34924p349. 24p34924p349 Try It 9.50 Simplify: 48x510048x5100. 48x510048x5100 How To Simplify a square root using the quotient property. Step 1. Simplify the fraction in the radicand, if possible. Step 2. Use the Quotient Property to rewrite the radical as the quotient of two radicals. Step 3. Simplify the radicals in the numerator and the denominator. Example 9.26 Simplify: 45x5y445x5y4. 45x5y445x5y4 Solution Try It 9.51 Simplify: 80m3n680m3n6. 80m3n680m3n6 Try It 9.52 Simplify: 54u7v854u7v8. 54u7v854u7v8 Be sure to simplify the fraction in the radicand first, if possible.

6 . A decorator decides to use square tiles as an accent strip in the design of a new shower, but she wants to rotate the tiles to look like diamonds. She will use 9 large tiles that measure 8 inches on a side and 8 small tiles that measure 2 inches on a side. Determine the width of the accent strip by simplifying the expression 9(82)+8(22)9(82)+8(22). (Round to the nearest tenth of an inch.) 9(82)+8(22)9(82)+8(22) 230 . Suzy wants to use square tiles on the border of a spa she is installing in her backyard. She will use large tiles that have area of 12 square inches, medium tiles that have area of 8 square inches, and small tiles that have area of 4 square inches. Once section of the border will require 4 large tiles, 8 medium tiles, and 10 small tiles to cover the width of the wall. Simplify the expression 412+88+104412+88+104 to determine the width of the wall. (Round to the nearest tenth of an inch.) 412+88+104412+88+104 .

Page 102,". A decorator decides to use square tiles as an accent strip in the design of a new shower, but she wants to rotate the tiles to look like diamonds. She will use 9 large tiles that measure 8 inches on a side and 8 small tiles that measure 2 inches on a side. Determine the width of the accent strip by simplifying the expression 9(82)+8(22)9(82)+8(22). (Round to the nearest tenth of an inch.) 9(82)+8(22)9(82)+8(22) 230 . Suzy wants to use square tiles on the border of a spa she is installing in her backyard. She will use large tiles that have area of 12 square inches, medium tiles that have area of 8 square inches, and small tiles that have area of 4 square inches. Once section of the border will require 4 large tiles, 8 medium tiles, and 10 small tiles to cover the width of the wall. Simplify the expression 412+88+104412+88+104 to determine the width of the wall. (Round to the nearest tenth of an inch.) 412+88+104412+88+104"

Page 103,"We have used the Product Property of Square Roots to simplify square roots by removing the perfect square factors. The Product Property of Square Roots says We can use the Product Property of Square Roots ‘in reverse’ to multiply square roots. Remember, we assume all variables are greater than or equal to zero. We will rewrite the Product Property of Square Roots so we see both ways together. Product Property of Square Roots If a, b are nonnegative real numbers, then So we can multiply 3·53·5 in this way: 3·53·5 Sometimes the product gives us a perfect square: Even when the product is not a perfect square, we must look for perfect-square factors and simplify the radical whenever possible. Multiplying radicals with coefficients is much like multiplying variables with coefficients. To multiply 4x·3y4x·3y we multiply the coefficients together and then the variables. The result is 12xy12xy. Keep this in mind as you do these examples. 4x·3y4x·3y 12xy12xy Example 9.44 Simplify: ⓐ 2·62·6 ⓑ (43)(212)(43)(212). ⓐ 2·62·6 ⓑ (43)(212)(43)(212) Solution ⓐ ⓐ ⓑ ⓑ Notice that in (b) we multiplied the coefficients and multiplied the radicals. Also, we did not simplify 1212. We waited to get the product and then simplified. 1212 Try It 9.87 Simplify: ⓐ 3·63·6 ⓑ (26)(312)(26)(312). ⓐ 3·63·6 ⓑ (26)(312)(26)(312) Try It 9.88 Simplify: ⓐ 5·105·10 ⓑ (63)(56)(63)(56). ⓐ 5·105·10 ⓑ (63)(56)(63)(56) Example 9.45 Simplify: (62)(310)(62)(310).

(33)(36)(33)(36) When we have to multiply square roots, we first find the product and then remove any perfect square factors. Example 9.46 Simplify: ⓐ (8x3)(3x)(8x3)(3x) ⓑ (20y2)(5y3)(20y2)(5y3). ⓐ (8x3)(3x)(8x3)(3x) ⓑ (20y2)(5y3)(20y2)(5y3) Solution ⓐ ⓐ ⓑ ⓑ Try It 9.91 Simplify: ⓐ (6x3)(3x)(6x3)(3x) ⓑ (2y3)(50y2)(2y3)(50y2). ⓐ (6x3)(3x)(6x3)(3x) ⓑ (2y3)(50y2)(2y3)(50y2) Try It 9.92 Simplify: ⓐ (6x5)(2x)(6x5)(2x) ⓑ (12y2)(3y5)(12y2)(3y5). ⓐ (6x5)(2x)(6x5)(2x) ⓑ (12y2)(3y5)(12y2)(3y5) Example 9.47 Simplify: (106p3)(318p)(106p3)(318p).

Squaring a Square Root If a is a nonnegative real number, then By realizing that squaring and taking a square root are ‘opposite’ operations, we can simplify (2)2(2)2 and get 2 right away. When we multiply the two like square roots in part (a) of the next example, it is the same as squaring. (2)2(2)2 like square roots Example 9.49 Simplify: ⓐ (23)(83)(23)(83) ⓑ (36)2(36)2. ⓐ (23)(83)(23)(83) ⓑ (36)2(36)2 Solution ⓐ ⓐ ⓑ ⓑ Try It 9.97 Simplify: ⓐ (611)(511)(611)(511) ⓑ (58)2(58)2. ⓐ (611)(511)(611)(511) ⓑ (58)2(58)2 Try It 9.98 Simplify: ⓐ (37)(107)(37)(107) ⓑ (−46)2(−46)2. ⓐ (37)(107)(37)(107) ⓑ (−46)2(−46)2"

Remember, this gave us four products before we combined any like terms. To be sure to get all four products, we organized our work—usually by the FOIL method.

(10+3n)(1−5n)(10+3n)(1−5n) Note that some special products made our work easier when we multiplied binomials earlier. This is true when we multiply square roots, too. The special product formulas we used are shown below. Special Product Formulas We will use the special product formulas in the next few examples. We will start with the Binomial Squares formula.

Page 103,"310 . A landscaper wants to put a square reflecting pool next to a triangular deck, as shown below. The triangular deck is a right triangle, with legs of length 9 feet and 11 feet, and the pool will be adjacent to the hypotenuse. ⓐ ⓑ . An artist wants to make a small monument in the shape of a square base topped by a right triangle, as shown below. The square base will be adjacent to one leg of the triangle. The other leg of the triangle will measure 2 feet and the hypotenuse will be 5 feet. ⓐ ⓑ 312 . A square garden will be made with a stone border on one edge. If only 3+103+10 feet of stone are available, simplify (3+10)2(3+10)2 to determine the area of the largest such garden. Round your answer to the nearest tenth of a foot. 3+103+10 (3+10)2(3+10)2 . A garden will be made so as to contain two square sections, one section with side length 5+65+6 yards and one section with side length 2+32+3 yards. Simplify 5+62+2+325+62+2+32 to determine the total area of the garden. Round your answer to the nearest tenth. 5+65+6 2+32+3 5+62+2+325+62+2+32 314 .

Page 104,"We know that we simplify fractions by removing factors common to the numerator and the denominator. When we have a fraction with a square root in the numerator, we first simplify the square root. Then we can look for common factors.

The Quotient Property of Square Roots says Sometimes we will need to use the Quotient Property of Square Roots ‘in reverse’ to simplify a fraction with square roots. We will rewrite the Quotient Property of Square Roots so we see both ways together. Remember: we assume all variables are greater than or equal to zero so that their square roots are real numbers. Quotient Property of Square Roots If a, b are non-negative real numbers and b≠0b≠0, then b≠0b≠0 We will use the Quotient Property of Square Roots ‘in reverse’ when the fraction we start with is the quotient of two square roots, and neither radicand is a perfect square. When we write the fraction in a single square root, we may find common factors in the numerator and denominator. Example 9.62 Simplify: 27752775. 27752775 Solution Try It 9.123 Simplify: 4810848108. 4810848108 Try It 9.124 Simplify: 96549654. 96549654 We will use the Quotient Property for Exponents, aman=am−naman=am−n, when we have variables with exponents in the radicands. aman=am−naman=am−n Example 9.63 Simplify: 6y52y6y52y. 6y52y6y52y Solution Try It 9.125 Simplify: 12r36r12r36r. 12r36r12r36r Try It 9.126 Simplify: 14p92p514p92p5. 14p92p514p92p5 Example 9.64 Simplify: 72x3162x72x3162x. 72x3162x72x3162x Solution Try It 9.127 Simplify: 50s3128s50s3128s. 50s3128s50s3128s Try It 9.128 Simplify: 75q5108q75q5108q. 75q5108q75q5108q Example 9.65 Simplify: 147ab83a3b4147ab83a3b4. 147ab83a3b4147ab83a3b4 Solution Try It 9.129 Simplify: 162x10y22x6y6162x10y22x6y6. 162x10y22x6y6162x10y22x6y6 Try It 9.130 Simplify: 300m3n73m5n300m3n73m5n. 300m3n73m5n300m3n73m5n"

Page 104,"Before the calculator became a tool of everyday life, tables of square roots were used to find approximate values of square roots. Figure 9.3 shows a portion of a table of squares and square roots. Square roots are approximated to five decimal places in this table. Figure 9.3 A table of square roots was used to find approximate values of square roots before there were calculators. If someone needed to approximate a fraction with a square root in the denominator, it meant doing long division with a five decimal-place divisor. This was a very cumbersome process. For this reason, a process called rationalizing the denominator was developed. A fraction with a radical in the denominator is converted to an equivalent fraction whose denominator is an integer. This process is still used today and is useful in other areas of mathematics, too. Rationalizing the Denominator The process of converting a fraction with a radical in the denominator to an equivalent fraction whose denominator is an integer is called rationalizing the denominator. rationalizing the denominator Square roots of numbers that are not perfect squares are irrational numbers. When we rationalize the denominator, we write an equivalent fraction with a rational number in the denominator. Let’s look at a numerical example. Suppose we need an approximate value for the fraction.12A five decimal place approximation to2is1.41421.11.41421Without a calculator, would you want to do this division?1.414211.0Suppose we need an approximate value for the fraction.12A five decimal place approximation to2is1.41421.11.41421Without a calculator, would you want to do this division?1.414211.0 Suppose we need an approximate value for the fraction.12A five decimal place approximation to2is1.41421.11.41421Without a calculator, would you want to do this division?1.414211.0Suppose we need an approximate value for the fraction.12A five decimal place approximation to2is1.41421.11.41421Without a calculator, would you want to do this division?1.414211.0 But we can find a fraction equivalent to 1212 by multiplying the numerator and denominator by 22. 1212 22 Now if we need an approximate value, we divide 21.4142121.41421. This is much easier. 21.4142121.41421 Even though we have calculators available nearly everywhere, a fraction with a radical in the denominator still must be rationalized. It is not considered simplified if the denominator contains a square root. Similarly, a square root is not considered simplified if the radicand contains a fraction. Simplified Square Roots A square root is considered simplified if there are To rationalize a denominator, we use the property that (a)2=a(a)2=a. If we square an irrational square root, we get a rational number. (a)2=a(a)2=a We will use this property to rationalize the denominator in the next example. Example 9.66 Simplify: 4343. 4343 Solution To rationalize a denominator, we can multiply a square root by itself. To keep the fraction equivalent, we multiply both the numerator and denominator by the same factor. Try It 9.131 Simplify: 5353. 5353 Try It 9.132 Simplify: 6565. 6565 Example 9.67 Simplify: −836−836. −836−836 Solution To remove the square root from the denominator, we multiply it by itself. To keep the fractions equivalent, we multiply both the numerator and denominator by 66. 66 Try It 9.133 Simplify: 525525. 525525 Try It 9.134 Simplify: −943−943. −943−943 Always simplify the radical in the denominator first, before you rationalize it. This way the numbers stay smaller and easier to work with. Example 9.68 Simplify: 512512. 512512 Solution Try It 9.135 Simplify: 718718. 718718 Try It 9.136 Simplify: 332332. 332332 Example 9.69 Simplify: 11281128. 11281128 Solution Try It 9.137 Simplify: 327327. 327327 Try It 9.138 Simplify: 10501050. 10501050"
Page 104,"When the denominator of a fraction is a sum or difference with square roots, we use the Product of Conjugates pattern to rationalize the denominator. When we multiply a binomial that includes a square root by its conjugate, the product has no square roots.

Page 105,"In this section we will solve equations that have the variable in the radicand of a square root. Equations of this type are called radical equations. Radical Equation An equation in which the variable is in the radicand of a square root is called a radical equation. radical equation As usual, in solving these equations, what we do to one side of an equation we must do to the other side as well. Since squaring a quantity and taking a square root are ‘opposite’ operations, we will square both sides in order to remove the radical sign and solve for the variable inside. But remember that when we write aa we mean the principal square root. So a≥0a≥0 always. When we solve radical equations by squaring both sides we may get an algebraic solution that would make aa negative. This algebraic solution would not be a solution to the original radical equation; it is an extraneous solution. We saw extraneous solutions when we solved rational equations, too. aa a≥0a≥0 aa radical equation Example 9.74 For the equation x+2=xx+2=x: x+2=xx+2=x ⓐ Is x=2x=2 a solution? ⓑ Is x=−1x=−1 a solution? ⓐ x=2x=2 ⓑ x=−1x=−1 Solution ⓐ Is x=2x=2 a solution? ⓐ x=2x=2 ⓑ Is x=−1x=−1 a solution? ⓑ x=−1x=−1 Try It 9.147 For the equation x+6=xx+6=x: x+6=xx+6=x ⓐ Is x=−2x=−2 a solution? ⓑ Is x=3x=3 a solution? ⓐ x=−2x=−2 ⓑ x=3x=3 Try It 9.148 For the equation −x+2=x−x+2=x: −x+2=x−x+2=x ⓐ Is x=−2x=−2 a solution? ⓑ Is x=1x=1 a solution? ⓐ x=−2x=−2 ⓑ x=1x=1 Now we will see how to solve a radical equation. Our strategy is based on the relation between taking a square root and squaring. Example 9.75 Solve: 2x−1=72x−1=7. 2x−1=72x−1=7 Solution Try It 9.149 Solve: 3x−5=53x−5=5. 3x−5=53x−5=5 Try It 9.150 Solve: 4x+8=64x+8=6. 4x+8=64x+8=6 How To Solve a radical equation. Step 1. Isolate the radical on one side of the equation. Step 2. Square both sides of the equation. Step 3. Solve the new equation. Step 4. Check the answer. Example 9.76 Solve: 5n−4−9=05n−4−9=0. 5n−4−9=05n−4−9=0 Solution Try It 9.151 Solve: 3m+2−5=03m+2−5=0. 3m+2−5=03m+2−5=0 Try It 9.152 Solve: 10z+1−2=010z+1−2=0. 10z+1−2=010z+1−2=0 Example 9.77 Solve: 3y+5+2=53y+5+2=5. 3y+5+2=53y+5+2=5 Solution Try It 9.153 Solve: 3p+3+3=53p+3+3=5. 3p+3+3=53p+3+3=5 Try It 9.154 Solve: 5q+1+4=65q+1+4=6. 5q+1+4=65q+1+4=6 When we use a radical sign, we mean the principal or positive root. If an equation has a square root equal to a negative number, that equation will have no solution. Example 9.78 Solve: 9k−2+1=09k−2+1=0. 9k−2+1=09k−2+1=0 Solution Try It 9.155 Solve: 2r−3+5=02r−3+5=0. 2r−3+5=02r−3+5=0 Try It 9.156 Solve: 7s−3+2=07s−3+2=0. 7s−3+2=07s−3+2=0 If one side of the equation is a binomial, we use the binomial squares formula when we square it. Binomial Squares Don’t forget the middle term! Example 9.79 Solve: p−1+1=pp−1+1=p. p−1+1=pp−1+1=p Solution Try It 9.157 Solve: x−2+2=xx−2+2=x. x−2+2=xx−2+2=x Try It 9.158 Solve: y−5+5=yy−5+5=y. y−5+5=yy−5+5=y"

Page 105,"As you progress through your college courses, you’ll encounter formulas that include square roots in many disciplines. We have already used formulas to solve geometry applications. We will use our Problem Solving Strategy for Geometry Applications, with slight modifications, to give us a plan for solving applications with formulas from any discipline. How To Solve applications with formulas. Step 1. Read the problem and make sure all the words and ideas are understood. When appropriate, draw a figure and label it with the given information. Step 2. Identify what we are looking for. Step 3. Name what we are looking for by choosing a variable to represent it. Step 4. Translate into an equation by writing the appropriate formula or model for the situation. Substitute in the given information. Step 5. Solve the equation using good algebra techniques. Step 6. Check the answer in the problem and make sure it makes sense. Step 7. Answer the question with a complete sentence. We used the formula A=L·WA=L·W to find the area of a rectangle with length L and width W. A square is a rectangle in which the length and width are equal. If we let s be the length of a side of a square, the area of the square is s2s2. A=L·WA=L·W s2s2 The formula A=s2A=s2 gives us the area of a square if we know the length of a side. What if we want to find the length of a side for a given area? Then we need to solve the equation for s. A=s2A=s2 A=s2Take the square root of both sides.A=s2Simplify.A=sA=s2Take the square root of both sides.A=s2Simplify.A=s A=s2Take the square root of both sides.A=s2Simplify.A=sA=s2Take the square root of both sides.A=s2Simplify.A=s We can use the formula s=As=A to find the length of a side of a square for a given area. s=As=A Area of a Square We will show an example of this in the next example. Example 9.85 Mike and Lychelle want to make a square patio. They have enough concrete to pave an area of 200 square feet. Use the formula s=As=A to find the length of each side of the patio. Round your answer to the nearest tenth of a foot. s=As=A Solution Try It 9.169 Katie wants to plant a square lawn in her front yard. She has enough sod to cover an area of 370 square feet. Use the formula s=As=A to find the length of each side of her lawn. Round your answer to the nearest tenth of a foot. s=As=A Try It 9.170 Sergio wants to make a square mosaic as an inlay for a table he is building. He has enough tile to cover an area of 2704 square centimeters. Use the formula s=As=A to find the length of each side of his mosaic. Round your answer to the nearest tenth of a centimeter. s=As=A Another application of square roots has to do with gravity. Falling Objects On Earth, if an object is dropped from a height of hh feet, the time in seconds it will take to reach the ground is found by using the formula, hh For example, if an object is dropped from a height of 64 feet, we can find the time it takes to reach the ground by substituting h=64h=64 into the formula. h=64h=64 It would take 2 seconds for an object dropped from a height of 64 feet to reach the ground. Example 9.86 Christy dropped her sunglasses from a bridge 400 feet above a river. Use the formula t=h4t=h4 to find how many seconds it took for the sunglasses to reach the river. t=h4t=h4 Solution Try It 9.171 A helicopter dropped a rescue package from a height of 1,296 feet. Use the formula t=h4t=h4 to find how many seconds it took for the package to reach the ground. t=h4t=h4 Try It 9.172 A window washer dropped a squeegee from a platform 196 feet above the sidewalk Use the formula t=h4t=h4 to find how many seconds it took for the squeegee to reach the sidewalk. t=h4t=h4 Police officers investigating car accidents measure the length of the skid marks on the pavement. Then they use square roots to determine the speed, in miles per hour, a car was going before applying the brakes. Skid Marks and Speed of a Car If the length of the skid marks is d feet, then the speed, s, of the car before the brakes were applied can be found by using the formula, Example 9.87 After a car accident, the skid marks for one car measured 190 feet. Use the formula s=24ds=24d to find the speed of the car before the brakes were applied. Round your answer to the nearest tenth. s=24ds=24d Solution Try It 9.173 An accident investigator measured the skid marks of the car. The length of the skid marks was 76 feet. Use the formula s=24ds=24d to find the speed of the car before the brakes were applied. Round your answer to the nearest tenth. s=24ds=24d Try It 9.174 The skid marks of a vehicle involved in an accident were 122 feet long. Use the formula s=24ds=24d to find the speed of the vehicle before the brakes were applied. Round your answer to the nearest tenth. s=24ds=24d"

Page 106,"Up to now, in this chapter we have worked with squares and square roots. We will now extend our work to include higher powers and higher roots. Let’s review some vocabulary first. The terms ‘squared’ and ‘cubed’ come from the formulas for area of a square and volume of a cube. It will be helpful to have a table of the powers of the integers from −5to5−5to5. See Figure 9.4. −5to5−5to5 Figure 9.4 First through fifth powers of integers from −5−5 to 5.5. Notice the signs in Figure 9.4. All powers of positive numbers are positive, of course. But when we have a negative number, the even powers are positive and the odd powers are negative. We’ll copy the row with the powers of −2−2 below to help you see this. −2−2 Earlier in this chapter we defined the square root of a number. And we have used the notation mm to denote the principal square root. So m≥0m≥0 always. mm principal square root m≥0m≥0 We will now extend the definition to higher roots. nth Root of a Number If bn=abn=a, then bb is an nth root of a number aa. bn=abn=a bb nth root of a number aa The principal nth root of aa is written anan. aa anan n is called the index of the radical. index We do not write the index for a square root. Just like we use the word ‘cubed’ for b3b3, we use the term ‘cube root’ for a3a3. b3b3 a3a3 We refer to Figure 9.4 to help us find higher roots. Could we have an even root of a negative number? No. We know that the square root of a negative number is not a real number. The same is true for any even root. Even roots of negative numbers are not real numbers. Odd roots of negative numbers are real numbers. Properties of

Now we will remove this restriction. The odd root of a number can be either positive or negative. We have seen that −643=−4−643=−4. −643=−4−643=−4 But the even root of a non-negative number is always non-negative, because we take the principal nth root. principal nth root Suppose we start with a=−5a=−5. a=−5a=−5 How can we make sure the fourth root of −5 raised to the fourth power, (−5)4(−5)4 is 5? We will see in the following property. (−5)4(−5)4 Simplifying Odd and Even Roots For any integer n≥2n≥2, n≥2n≥2 We must use the absolute value signs when we take an even root of an expression with a variable in the radical.

4 520 . Population growth The expression 10·xn10·xn models the growth of a mold population after nn generations. There were 10 spores at the start, and each had xx offspring. So 10·x510·x5 is the number of offspring at the fifth generation. At the fifth generation there were 10,240 offspring. Simplify the expression 10,24010510,240105 to determine the number of offspring of each spore. 10·xn10·xn nn xx 10·x510·x5 10,24010510,240105 .

Page 107,"Rational exponents are another way of writing expressions with radicals. When we use rational exponents, we can apply the properties of exponents to simplify expressions. rational exponents The Power Property for Exponents says that (am)n=am·n(am)n=am·n when m and n are whole numbers. Let’s assume we are now not limited to whole numbers. (am)n=am·n(am)n=am·n Suppose we want to find a number p such that (8p)3=8(8p)3=8. We will use the Power Property of Exponents to find the value of p. (8p)3=8(8p)3=8 But we know also (83)3=8(83)3=8. Then it must be that 813=83813=83. (83)3=8(83)3=8 813=83813=83 This same logic can be used for any positive integer exponent n to show that a1n=ana1n=an. a1n=ana1n=an Rational Exponent

Page 113,"We have already solved some quadratic equations by factoring. Let’s review how we used factoring to solve the quadratic equation x2=9x2=9. x2=9x2=9 We can easily use factoring to find the solutions of similar equations, like x2=16x2=16 and x2=25x2=25, because 16 and 25 are perfect squares. But what happens when we have an equation like x2=7x2=7? Since 7 is not a perfect square, we cannot solve the equation by factoring. x2=16x2=16 x2=25x2=25 x2=7x2=7 These equations are all of the form x2=kx2=k.We defined the square root of a number in this way: x2=kx2=k This leads to the Square Root Property. Square Root Property Square Root Property If x2=kx2=k, and k≥0k≥0, then x=korx=−kx=korx=−k. x2=kx2=k k≥0k≥0 x=korx=−kx=korx=−k Notice that the Square Root Property gives two solutions to an equation of the form x2=kx2=k: the principal square root of kk and its opposite. We could also write the solution as x=±kx=±k. Square Root Property x2=kx2=k kk x=±kx=±k Now, we will solve the equation x2=9x2=9 again, this time using the Square Root Property. x2=9x2=9 What happens when the constant is not a perfect square? Let’s use the Square Root Property to solve the equation x2=7x2=7. x2=7x2=7 Example 10.1 Solve: x2=169x2=169. x2=169x2=169 Solution Use the Square Root Property.

Step 1. Isolate the quadratic term and make its coefficient one. Step 2. Use Square Root Property. Step 3. Simplify the radical. Step 4. Check the solutions. To use the Square Root Property, the coefficient of the variable term must equal 1. In the next example, we must divide both sides of the equation by 5 before using the Square Root Property. Example 10.3 Solve: 5m2=805m2=80. 5m2=805m2=80 Solution Try It 10.5 Solve: 2x2=982x2=98. 2x2=982x2=98 Try It 10.6 Solve: 3z2=1083z2=108. 3z2=1083z2=108 The Square Root Property started by stating, ‘If x2=kx2=k, and k≥0k≥0’. What will happen if k<0k<0? This will be the case in the next example. x2=kx2=k k≥0k≥0 k<0k<0 Example 10.4 Solve: q2+24=0q2+24=0. q2+24=0q2+24=0 Solution Try It 10.7 Solve: c2+12=0c2+12=0. c2+12=0c2+12=0 Try It 10.8 Solve: d2+81=0d2+81=0. d2+81=0d2+81=0 Remember, we first isolate the quadratic term and then make the coefficient equal to one. Example 10.5 Solve: 23u2+5=1723u2+5=17. 23u2+5=1723u2+5=17 Solution Try It 10.9 Solve: 12x2+4=2412x2+4=24. 12x2+4=2412x2+4=24 Try It 10.10 Solve: 34y2−3=1834y2−3=18. 34y2−3=1834y2−3=18 The solutions to some equations may have fractions inside the radicals. When this happens, we must rationalize the denominator. rationalize Example 10.6 Solve: 2c2−4=452c2−4=45. 2c2−4=452c2−4=45 Solution Try It 10.11 Solve: 5r2−2=345r2−2=34. 5r2−2=345r2−2=34 Try It 10.12 Solve: 3t2+6=703t2+6=70. 3t2+6=703t2+6=70"

(r−3)2=25(r−3)2=25 Example 10.8 Solve: (y−7)2=12(y−7)2=12. (y−7)2=12(y−7)2=12 Solution Try It 10.15 Solve: (a−3)2=18(a−3)2=18. (a−3)2=18(a−3)2=18 Try It 10.16 Solve: (b+2)2=40(b+2)2=40. (b+2)2=40(b+2)2=40 Remember, when we take the square root of a fraction, we can take the square root of the numerator and denominator separately. Example 10.9 Solve: (x−12)2=54.(x−12)2=54. (x−12)2=54.(x−12)2=54. Solution Try It 10.17 Solve: (x−13)2=59.(x−13)2=59. (x−13)2=59.(x−13)2=59. Try It 10.18 Solve: (y−34)2=716.(y−34)2=716. (y−34)2=716.(y−34)2=716. We will start the solution to the next example by isolating the binomial. Example 10.10 Solve: (x−2)2+3=30(x−2)2+3=30. (x−2)2+3=30(x−2)2+3=30 Solution Try It 10.19 Solve: (a−5)2+4=24(a−5)2+4=24. (a−5)2+4=24(a−5)2+4=24 Try It 10.20 Solve: (b−3)2−8=24(b−3)2−8=24. (b−3)2−8=24(b−3)2−8=24 Example 10.11 Solve: (3v−7)2=−12(3v−7)2=−12. (3v−7)2=−12(3v−7)2=−12 Solution Try It 10.21 Solve: (3r+4)2=−8(3r+4)2=−8. (3r+4)2=−8(3r+4)2=−8 Try It 10.22 Solve: (2t−8)2=−10(2t−8)2=−10. (2t−8)2=−10(2t−8)2=−10 The left sides of the equations in the next two examples do not seem to be of the form a(x−h)2a(x−h)2. But they are perfect square trinomials, so we will factor to put them in the form we need. a(x−h)2a(x−h)2 Example 10.12 Solve: p2−10p+25=18p2−10p+25=18. p2−10p+25=18p2−10p+25=18 Solution The left side of the equation is a perfect square trinomial. We will factor it first. Try It 10.23 Solve: x2−6x+9=12x2−6x+9=12. x2−6x+9=12x2−6x+9=12 Try It 10.24 Solve: y2+12y+36=32y2+12y+36=32. y2+12y+36=32y2+12y+36=32 Example 10.13 Solve: 4n2+4n+1=164n2+4n+1=16. 4n2+4n+1=164n2+4n+1=16 Solution Again, we notice the left side of the equation is a perfect square trinomial. We will factor it first. Try It 10.25 Solve: 9m2−12m+4=259m2−12m+4=25. 9m2−12m+4=259m2−12m+4=25 Try It 10.26 Solve: 16n2+40n+25=416n2+40n+25=4. 16n2+40n+25=416n2+40n+25=4 Media Access these online resources for additional instruction and practice with solving quadratic equations:"

She wants to have four square windows of equal size in the living room, with a total area of 64 square feet. Solve the equation 4s2=644s2=64 to find ss, the length of the sides of the windows. 4s2=644s2=64 ss . Explain why the equation x2+12=8x2+12=8 has no solution. x2+12=8x2+12=8 56 . Explain why the equation y2+8=12y2+8=12 has two solutions. y2+8=12y2+8=12 ⓐ After completing the exercises, use this checklist to evaluate your mastery of the objectives of this section. ⓐ ⓑ If most of your checks were: ⓑ …confidently: Congratulations! You have achieved the objectives in this section. Reflect on the study skills you used so that you can continue to use them. What did you do to become confident of your ability to do these things? Be specific. …with some help: This must be addressed quickly because topics you do not master become potholes in your road to success. In math, every topic builds upon previous work. It is important to make sure you have a strong foundation before you move on. Whom can you ask for help? Your fellow classmates and instructor are good resources. Is there a place on campus where math tutors are available? Can your study skills be improved? …no-I don’t get it! This is a warning sign and you must not ignore it. You should get help right away or you will quickly be overwhelmed. See your instructor as soon as you can to discuss your situation. Together you can come up with a plan to get you the help you need."

Page 114,"In the last section, we were able to use the Square Root Property to solve the equation (y−7)2=12(y−7)2=12 because the left side was a perfect square. (y−7)2=12(y−7)2=12 We also solved an equation in which the left side was a perfect square trinomial, but we had to rewrite it the form (x−k)2(x−k)2 in order to use the square root property. (x−k)2(x−k)2 What happens if the variable is not part of a perfect square? Can we use algebra to make a perfect square? Let’s study the binomial square pattern we have used many times. We will look at two examples. Binomial Squares Pattern If a,ba,b are real numbers, a,ba,b We can use this pattern to “make” a perfect square. We will start with the expression x2+6xx2+6x. Since there is a plus sign between the two terms, we will use the (a+b)2(a+b)2 pattern. x2+6xx2+6x (a+b)2(a+b)2 Notice that the first term of x2+6xx2+6x is a square, x2x2. x2+6xx2+6x x2x2 We now know a=xa=x. a=xa=x What number can we add to x2+6xx2+6x to make a perfect square trinomial? x2+6xx2+6x The middle term of the Binomial Squares Pattern, 2ab2ab, is twice the product of the two terms of the binomial. This means twice the product of xx and some number is 6x6x. So, two times some number must be six. The number we need is 12·6=3.12·6=3. The second term in the binomial, b,b, must be 3. 2ab2ab xx 6x6x 12·6=3.12·6=3. b,b, We now know b=3b=3. b=3b=3 Now, we just square the second term of the binomial to get the last term of the perfect square trinomial, so we square three to get the last term, nine. We can now factor to So, we found that adding nine to x2+6xx2+6x ‘completes the square,’ and we write it as (x+3)2(x+3)2. x2+6xx2+6x (x+3)2(x+3)2 How To Complete a square. To complete the square of x2+bxx2+bx: x2+bxx2+bx Step 1. Identify bb, the coefficient of xx. Step 2. Find (12b)2(12b)2, the number to complete the square. Step 3. Add the (12b)2(12b)2 to x2+bxx2+bx.

Page 114,"In solving equations, we must always do the same thing to both sides of the equation. This is true, of course, when we solve a quadratic equation by completing the square, too. When we add a term to one side of the equation to make a perfect square trinomial, we must also add the same term to the other side of the equation. completing the square For example, if we start with the equation x2+6x=40x2+6x=40 and we want to complete the square on the left, we will add nine to both sides of the equation. x2+6x=40x2+6x=40 Then, we factor on the left and simplify on the right. Now the equation is in the form to solve using the Square Root Property. Completing the square is a way to transform an equation into the form we need to be able to use the Square Root Property. Example 10.18 Solve x2+8x=48x2+8x=48 by completing the square. x2+8x=48x2+8x=48 Solution Try It 10.35 Solve c2+4c=5c2+4c=5 by completing the square. c2+4c=5c2+4c=5 Try It 10.36 Solve d2+10d=−9d2+10d=−9 by completing the square. d2+10d=−9d2+10d=−9 How To Solve a quadratic equation of the form x2+bx+c=0x2+bx+c=0 by completing the square. Step 1. Isolate the variable terms on one side and the constant terms on the other. Step 2. Find (12·b)2(12·b)2, the number to complete the square. Add it to both sides of the equation. Step 3. Factor the perfect square trinomial as a binomial square. Step 4. Use the Square Root Property. Step 5. Simplify the radical and then solve the two resulting equations. Step 6. Check the solutions. Example 10.19 Solve y2−6y=16y2−6y=16 by completing the square. y2−6y=16y2−6y=16 Solution Try It 10.37 Solve r2−4r=12r2−4r=12 by completing the square. r2−4r=12r2−4r=12 Try It 10.38 Solve t2−10t=11t2−10t=11 by completing the square. t2−10t=11t2−10t=11 Example 10.20 Solve x2+4x=−21x2+4x=−21 by completing the square. x2+4x=−21x2+4x=−21 Solution Try It 10.39 Solve y2−10y=−35y2−10y=−35 by completing the square. y2−10y=−35y2−10y=−35 Try It 10.40 Solve z2+8z=−19z2+8z=−19 by completing the square. z2+8z=−19z2+8z=−19 In the previous example, there was no real solution because (x+k)2(x+k)2 was equal to a negative number. (x+k)2(x+k)2 Example 10.21 Solve p2−18p=−6p2−18p=−6 by completing the square. p2−18p=−6p2−18p=−6 Solution Another way to check this would be to use a calculator. Evaluate p2−18pp2−18p for both of the solutions. The answer should be −6−6. p2−18pp2−18p −6−6 Try It 10.41 Solve x2−16x=−16x2−16x=−16 by completing the square. x2−16x=−16x2−16x=−16 Try It 10.42 Solve y2+8y=11y2+8y=11 by completing the square. y2+8y=11y2+8y=11 We will start the next example by isolating the variable terms on the left side of the equation. Example 10.22 Solve x2+10x+4=15x2+10x+4=15 by completing the square. x2+10x+4=15x2+10x+4=15 Solution Try It 10.43 Solve a2+4a+9=30a2+4a+9=30 by completing the square. a2+4a+9=30a2+4a+9=30 Try It 10.44 Solve b2+8b−4=16b2+8b−4=16 by completing the square. b2+8b−4=16b2+8b−4=16 To solve the next equation, we must first collect all the variable terms to the left side of the equation. Then, we proceed as we did in the previous examples. Example 10.23 Solve n2=3n+11n2=3n+11 by completing the square. n2=3n+11n2=3n+11 Solution Try It 10.45 Solve p2=5p+9p2=5p+9 by completing the square. p2=5p+9p2=5p+9 Try It 10.46 Solve q2=7q−3q2=7q−3 by completing the square. q2=7q−3q2=7q−3 Notice that the left side of the next equation is in factored form. But the right side is not zero, so we cannot use the Zero Product Property. Instead, we multiply the factors and then put the equation into the standard form to solve by completing the square. Example 10.24 Solve (x−3)(x+5)=9(x−3)(x+5)=9 by completing the square. (x−3)(x+5)=9(x−3)(x+5)=9 Solution Try It 10.47 Solve (c−2)(c+8)=7(c−2)(c+8)=7 by completing the square. (c−2)(c+8)=7(c−2)(c+8)=7 Try It 10.48 Solve (d−7)(d+3)=56(d−7)(d+3)=56 by completing the square. (d−7)(d+3)=56(d−7)(d+3)=56"
Page 114,"The process of completing the square works best when the leading coefficient is one, so the left side of the equation is of the form x2+bx+cx2+bx+c. If the x2x2 term has a coefficient, we take some preliminary steps to make the coefficient equal to one. x2+bx+cx2+bx+c x2x2 Sometimes the coefficient can be factored from all three terms of the trinomial. This will be our strategy in the next example. Example 10.25 Solve 3x2−12x−15=03x2−12x−15=0 by completing the square. 3x2−12x−15=03x2−12x−15=0 Solution To complete the square, we need the coefficient of x2x2 to be one. If we factor out the coefficient of x2x2 as a common factor, we can continue with solving the equation by completing the square. x2x2 x2x2 Try It 10.49 Solve 2m2+16m−8=02m2+16m−8=0 by completing the square. 2m2+16m−8=02m2+16m−8=0 Try It 10.50 Solve 4n2−24n−56=84n2−24n−56=8 by completing the square. 4n2−24n−56=84n2−24n−56=8 To complete the square, the leading coefficient must be one. When the leading coefficient is not a factor of all the terms, we will divide both sides of the equation by the leading coefficient. This will give us a fraction for the second coefficient. We have already seen how to complete the square with fractions in this section. Example 10.26 Solve 2x2−3x=202x2−3x=20 by completing the square. 2x2−3x=202x2−3x=20 Solution Again, our first step will be to make the coefficient of x2x2 be one. By dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of x2x2, we can then continue with solving the equation by completing the square. x2x2 x2x2 Try It 10.51 Solve 3r2−2r=213r2−2r=21 by completing the square. 3r2−2r=213r2−2r=21 Try It 10.52 Solve 4t2+2t=204t2+2t=20 by completing the square. 4t2+2t=204t2+2t=20 Example 10.27 Solve 3x2+2x=43x2+2x=4 by completing the square. 3x2+2x=43x2+2x=4 Solution Again, our first step will be to make the coefficient of x2x2 be one. By dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of x2x2, we can then continue with solving the equation by completing the square. x2x2 x2x2 Try It 10.53 Solve 4x2+3x=124x2+3x=12 by completing the square. 4x2+3x=124x2+3x=12 Try It 10.54 Solve 5y2+3y=105y2+3y=10 by completing the square. 5y2+3y=105y2+3y=10 Media Access these online resources for additional instruction and practice with solving quadratic equations by completing the square:"

Page 115,"When we solved the quadratic equations in the previous examples, sometimes we got two solutions, sometimes one solution, sometimes no real solutions. Is there a way to predict the number of solutions to a quadratic equation without actually solving the equation? Yes, the quantity inside the radical of the Quadratic Formula makes it easy for us to determine the number of solutions. This quantity is called the discriminant. discriminant Discriminant In the Quadratic Formula x=−b±b2−4ac2ax=−b±b2−4ac2a, the quantity b2−4acb2−4ac is called the discriminant. x=−b±b2−4ac2ax=−b±b2−4ac2a b2−4acb2−4ac discriminant Let’s look at the discriminant of the equations in Example 10.28, Example 10.32, and Example 10.35, and the number of solutions to those quadratic equations. When the discriminant is positive (x=−b±+2a)(x=−b±+2a) the quadratic equation has two solutions. (x=−b±+2a)(x=−b±+2a) When the discriminant is zero (x=−b±02a)(x=−b±02a) the quadratic equation has one solution. (x=−b±02a)(x=−b±02a) When the discriminant is negative (x=−b±−2a)(x=−b±−2a) the quadratic equation has no real solutions. (x=−b±−2a)(x=−b±−2a) How To Use the discriminant, b2−4acb2−4ac, to determine the number of solutions of a Quadratic Equation.

Page 115,"We have used four methods to solve quadratic equations: You can solve any quadratic equation by using the Quadratic Formula, but that is not always the easiest method to use. How To Identify the most appropriate method to solve a Quadratic Equation. Step 1. Try Factoring first. If the quadratic factors easily, this method is very quick. Step 2. Try the Square Root Property next. If the equation fits the form ax2=kax2=k or a(x−h)2=ka(x−h)2=k, it can easily be solved by using the Square Root Property. Step 3. Use the Quadratic Formula. Any quadratic equation can be solved by using the Quadratic Formula. What about the method of completing the square? Most people find that method cumbersome and prefer not to use it. We needed to include it in this chapter because we completed the square in general to derive the Quadratic Formula. You will also use the process of completing the square in other areas of algebra. Example 10.37 Identify the most appropriate method to use to solve each quadratic equation: ⓐ 5z2=175z2=17 ⓑ 4x2−12x+9=04x2−12x+9=0 ⓒ 8u2+6u=118u2+6u=11 ⓐ 5z2=175z2=17 ⓑ 4x2−12x+9=04x2−12x+9=0 ⓒ 8u2+6u=118u2+6u=11 Solution ⓐ 5z2=175z2=17 ⓐ 5z2=175z2=17 Since the equation is in the ax2=kax2=k, the most appropriate method is to use the Square Root Property. ax2=kax2=k ⓑ 4x2−12x+9=04x2−12x+9=0 ⓑ 4x2−12x+9=04x2−12x+9=0 We recognize that the left side of the equation is a perfect square trinomial, and so Factoring will be the most appropriate method. ⓒ 8u2+6u=118u2+6u=11 ⓒ 8u2+6u=118u2+6u=11 Put the equation in standard form. 8u2+6u−11=08u2+6u−11=0 8u2+6u−11=08u2+6u−11=0 While our first thought may be to try Factoring, thinking about all the possibilities for trial and error leads us to choose the Quadratic Formula as the most appropriate method Try It 10.73 Identify the most appropriate method to use to solve each quadratic equation: ⓐ x2+6x+8=0x2+6x+8=0 ⓑ (n−3)2=16(n−3)2=16 ⓒ 5p2−6p=95p2−6p=9 ⓐ x2+6x+8=0x2+6x+8=0 ⓑ (n−3)2=16(n−3)2=16 ⓒ 5p2−6p=95p2−6p=9 Try It 10.74 Identify the most appropriate method to use to solve each quadratic equation: ⓐ 8a2+3a−9=08a2+3a−9=0 ⓑ 4b2+4b+1=04b2+4b+1=0 ⓒ 5c2=1255c2=125 ⓐ 8a2+3a−9=08a2+3a−9=0 ⓑ 4b2+4b+1=04b2+4b+1=0 ⓒ 5c2=1255c2=125 Media Access these online resources for additional instruction and practice with using the Quadratic Formula:"

Page 116,"We solved some applications that are modeled by quadratic equations earlier, when the only method we had to solve them was factoring. Now that we have more methods to solve quadratic equations, we will take another look at applications. To get us started, we will copy our usual Problem Solving Strategy here so we can follow the steps. How To Use the problem solving strategy. Step 1. Read the problem. Make sure all the words and ideas are understood. Step 2. Identify what we are looking for. Step 3. Name what we are looking for. Choose a variable to represent that quantity. Step 4. Translate into an equation. It may be helpful to restate the problem in one sentence with all the important information. Then, translate the English sentence into an algebra equation. Step 5. Solve the equation using good algebra techniques. Step 6. Check the answer in the problem and make sure it makes sense. Step 7. Answer the question with a complete sentence. We have solved number applications that involved consecutive even integers and consecutive odd integers by modeling the situation with linear equations. Remember, we noticed each even integer is 2 more than the number preceding it. If we call the first one n, then the next one is n+2n+2. The next one would be n+2+2n+2+2 or n+4n+4. This is also true when we use odd integers. One set of even integers and one set of odd integers are shown below. consecutive even integers consecutive odd integers n+2n+2 n+2+2n+2+2 n+4n+4 Some applications of consecutive odd integers or consecutive even integers are modeled by quadratic equations. The notation above will be helpful as you name the variables. consecutive odd integers consecutive even integers Example 10.38 The product of two consecutive odd integers is 195. Find the integers. Solution Try It 10.75 The product of two consecutive odd integers is 99. Find the integers. Try It 10.76 The product of two consecutive odd integers is 168. Find the integers. We will use the formula for the area of a triangle to solve the next example. Area of a Triangle For a triangle with base bb and height hh, the area, AA, is given by the formula A=12bhA=12bh. bb hh AA A=12bhA=12bh Recall that, when we solve geometry applications, it is helpful to draw the figure. Example 10.39 An architect is designing the entryway of a restaurant. She wants to put a triangular window above the doorway. Due to energy restrictions, the window can have an area of 120 square feet and the architect wants the width to be 4 feet more than twice the height. Find the height and width of the window. Solution Notice that the solutions were integers. That tells us that we could have solved the equation by factoring. When we wrote the equation in standard form, h2+2h−120=0h2+2h−120=0, we could have factored it. If we did, we would have solved the equation (h+12)(h−10)=0(h+12)(h−10)=0. h2+2h−120=0h2+2h−120=0 (h+12)(h−10)=0(h+12)(h−10)=0 Try It 10.77 Find the dimensions of a triangle whose width is four more than six times its height and has an area of 208 square inches.

In the two preceding examples, the number in the radical in the Quadratic Formula was a perfect square and so the solutions were rational numbers. If we get an irrational number as a solution to an application problem, we will use a calculator to get an approximate value.

Page 117,"We have graphed equations of the form Ax+By=CAx+By=C. We called equations like this linear equations because their graphs are straight lines. Ax+By=CAx+By=C Now, we will graph equations of the form y=ax2+bx+cy=ax2+bx+c. We call this kind of equation a quadratic equation in two variables. y=ax2+bx+cy=ax2+bx+c quadratic equation in two variables Quadratic Equation in Two Variables A quadratic equation in two variables, where a,b,andca,b,andc are real numbers and a≠0a≠0, is an equation of the form quadratic equation in two variables a,b,andca,b,andc a≠0a≠0 Just like we started graphing linear equations by plotting points, we will do the same for quadratic equations. Let’s look first at graphing the quadratic equation y=x2y=x2. We will choose integer values of xx between −2−2 and 2 and find their yy values. See Table 10.1. y=x2y=x2 xx −2−2 yy Table 10.1 Notice when we let x=1x=1 and x=−1x=−1, we got the same value for yy. x=1x=1 x=−1x=−1 yy The same thing happened when we let x=2x=2 and x=−2x=−2. x=2x=2 x=−2x=−2 Now, we will plot the points to show the graph of y=x2y=x2. See Figure 10.2. y=x2y=x2 Figure 10.2 The graph is not a line. This figure is called a parabola. Every quadratic equation has a graph that looks like this. parabola In Example 10.43 you will practice graphing a parabola by plotting a few points.

Page 117,"Look again at Figure 10.3. Do you see that we could fold each parabola in half and that one side would lie on top of the other? The ‘fold line’ is a line of symmetry. We call it the axis of symmetry of the parabola. axis of symmetry We show the same two graphs again with the axis of symmetry in blue. See Figure 10.4. Figure 10.4 The equation of the axis of symmetry can be derived by using the Quadratic Formula. We will omit the derivation here and proceed directly to using the result. The equation of the axis of symmetry of the graph of y=ax2+bx+cy=ax2+bx+c is x=−b2a.x=−b2a. axis of symmetry y=ax2+bx+cy=ax2+bx+c x=−b2a.x=−b2a. So, to find the equation of symmetry of each of the parabolas we graphed above, we will substitute into the formula x=−b2ax=−b2a. x=−b2ax=−b2a Look back at Figure 10.4. Are these the equations of the dashed red lines? The point on the parabola that is on the axis of symmetry is the lowest or highest point on the parabola, depending on whether the parabola opens upwards or downwards. This point is called the vertex of the parabola. vertex We can easily find the coordinates of the vertex, because we know it is on the axis of symmetry. This means its x-coordinate is −b2a−b2a. To find the y-coordinate of the vertex, we substitute the value of the x-coordinate into the quadratic equation. −b2a−b2a Axis of Symmetry and Vertex of a Parabola For a parabola with equation y=ax2+bx+cy=ax2+bx+c: y=ax2+bx+cy=ax2+bx+c To find the y-coordinate of the vertex, we substitute x=−b2ax=−b2a into the quadratic equation. x=−b2ax=−b2a Example 10.45 For the parabola y=3x2−6x+2y=3x2−6x+2 find: ⓐ the axis of symmetry and ⓑ the vertex. y=3x2−6x+2y=3x2−6x+2 ⓐ ⓑ Solution ⓐ ⓑ Try It 10.89 For the parabola y=2x2−8x+1y=2x2−8x+1 find: ⓐ the axis of symmetry and ⓑ the vertex. y=2x2−8x+1y=2x2−8x+1 ⓐ ⓑ Try It 10.90 For the parabola y=2x2−4x−3y=2x2−4x−3 find: ⓐ the axis of symmetry and ⓑ the vertex. y=2x2−4x−3y=2x2−4x−3 ⓐ ⓑ"
Page 117,"When we graphed linear equations, we often used the x- and y-intercepts to help us graph the lines. Finding the coordinates of the intercepts will help us to graph parabolas, too. Remember, at the y-intercept the value of xx is zero. So, to find the y-intercept, we substitute x=0x=0 into the equation. y-intercept xx x=0x=0 Let’s find the y-intercepts of the two parabolas shown in the figure below. Figure 10.5 At an x-intercept, the value of yy is zero. To find an x-intercept, we substitute y=0y=0 into the equation. In other words, we will need to solve the equation 0=ax2+bx+c0=ax2+bx+c for xx. x-intercept yy y=0y=0 0=ax2+bx+c0=ax2+bx+c xx But solving quadratic equations like this is exactly what we have done earlier in this chapter.

We solved for xx and the results were the solutions to the equation. ax2+bx+c=0ax2+bx+c=0 xx We are now looking at quadratic equations in two variables of the form y=ax2+bx+cy=ax2+bx+c. The graphs of these equations are parabolas. The x-intercepts of the parabolas occur where y=0y=0. y=ax2+bx+cy=ax2+bx+c y=0y=0 For example: The solutions of the quadratic equation are the xx values of the x-intercepts. xx Earlier, we saw that quadratic equations have 2, 1, or 0 solutions. The graphs below show examples of parabolas for these three cases. Since the solutions of the equations give the x-intercepts of the graphs, the number of x-intercepts is the same as the number of solutions. Previously, we used the discriminant to determine the number of solutions of a quadratic equation of the form ax2+bx+c=0ax2+bx+c=0. Now, we can use the discriminant to tell us how many x-intercepts there are on the graph. ax2+bx+c=0ax2+bx+c=0 Before you start solving the quadratic equation to find the values of the x-intercepts, you may want to evaluate the discriminant so you know how many solutions to expect.

Remember how the discriminant determines the number of solutions of a quadratic equation? The discriminant of the equation 0=−x2+6x−90=−x2+6x−9 is 0, so there is only one solution.

See Figure 10.7. vertex Figure 10.7 Minimum or Maximum Values of a Quadratic Equation The y-coordinate of the vertex of the graph of a quadratic equation is the Example 10.53 Find the minimum value of the quadratic equation y=x2+2x−8y=x2+2x−8. y=x2+2x−8y=x2+2x−8 Solution Try It 10.105 Find the maximum or minimum value of the quadratic equation y=x2−8x+12y=x2−8x+12. y=x2−8x+12y=x2−8x+12 Try It 10.106 Find the maximum or minimum value of the quadratic equation y=−4x2+16x−11y=−4x2+16x−11. y=−4x2+16x−11y=−4x2+16x−11 We have used the formula to calculate the height in feet, hh, of an object shot upwards into the air with initial velocity, v0v0, after tt seconds. hh v0v0 tt This formula is a quadratic equation in the variable tt, so its graph is a parabola. By solving for the coordinates of the vertex, we can find how long it will take the object to reach its maximum height. Then, we can calculate the maximum height. tt Example 10.54 The quadratic equation h=−16t2+v0t+h0h=−16t2+v0t+h0 models the height of a volleyball hit straight upwards with velocity 176 feet per second from a height of 4 feet. h=−16t2+v0t+h0h=−16t2+v0t+h0 ⓐ ⓑ Solution h

The quadratic equation has a maximum. ⓐ ⓑ Try It 10.107 The quadratic equation h=−16t2+128t+32h=−16t2+128t+32 is used to find the height of a stone thrown upward from a height of 32 feet at a rate of 128 ft/sec. How long will it take for the stone to reach its maximum height? What is the maximum height? Round answers to the nearest tenth. h=−16t2+128t+32h=−16t2+128t+32 Try It 10.108 A toy rocket shot upward from the ground at a rate of 208 ft/sec has the quadratic equation of h=−16t2+208th=−16t2+208t. When will the rocket reach its maximum height? What will be the maximum height?

10 In the following exercises, solve. Rounding answers to the nearest tenth. . A ball is thrown upward from the ground with an initial velocity of 112 ft/sec. Use the quadratic equation h=−16t2+112th=−16t2+112t to find how long it will take the ball to reach maximum height, and then find the maximum height. h=−16t2+112th=−16t2+112t 322 . A daycare facility is enclosing a rectangular area along the side of their building for the children to play outdoors. They need to maximize the area using 180 feet of fencing on three sides of the yard. The quadratic equation A=−2x2+180xA=−2x2+180x gives the area, AA, of the yard for the length, xx, of the building that will border the yard. Find the length of the building that should border the yard to maximize the area, and then find the maximum area. A=−2x2+180xA=−2x2+180x AA xx"
