        ### "Can an AI win Ghanaâ€™s National Science and Maths Quiz?". 
        
        This is the question posed by the NSMQ AI Grand Challenge 
        which is an AI Grand Challenge for Education using Ghanaâ€™s National 
        Science and Maths Quiz competition (NSMQ) as a case study. 
        
        The goal of nsmqai is to build an AI to compete live in the NSMQ competition 
        and win â€” performing better than the best contestants in all rounds and stages of the competition.
